following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the denver broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach john fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of gary kubiak as the new head coach .
he set the nfl 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback brock osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season .
under kubiak , the broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback peyton manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the indianapolis colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season .
osweiler was injured , however , leading to manning 's return during the week 17 regular season finale , where the broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 san diego chargers , resulting in manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall afc seed .
under defensive coordinator wade phillips , the broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records .

the neoclassical architecture in warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the roman period .
some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the palace on the water ( rebuilt 1775–1795 ) , królikarnia ( 1782–1786 ) , carmelite church ( façade 1761–1783 ) and evangelical holy trinity church ( 1777–1782 ) .
exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war ( like mentioned kronenberg palace and insurance company rosja building ) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style ( like warsaw philharmony edifice originally inspired by palais garnier in paris ) .

despite that the warsaw university of technology building ( 1899–1902 ) is the most interesting of the late 19th-century architecture .
warsaw ’ s municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild the saxon palace and the brühl palace , the most distinctive buildings in prewar warsaw .
there are also many places commemorating the heroic history of warsaw .
pawiak , an infamous german gestapo prison now occupied by a mausoleum of memory of martyrdom and the museum , is only the beginning of a walk in the traces of heroic city .
the warsaw citadel , an impressive 19th-century fortification built after the defeat of the november uprising , was a place of martyr for the poles .
another important monument , the statue of little insurgent located at the ramparts of the old town , commemorates the children who served as messengers and frontline troops in the warsaw uprising , while the impressive warsaw uprising monument by wincenty kućma was erected in memory of the largest insurrection of world war ii .

other green spaces in the city include the botanic garden and the university library garden .
they have extensive botanical collection of rare domestic and foreign plants , while a palm house in the new orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world .
besides , within the city borders , there are also : pole mokotowskie ( a big park in the northern mokotów , where was the first horse racetrack and then the airport ) , park ujazdowski ( close to the sejm and john lennon street ) , park of culture and rest in powsin , by the southern city border , park skaryszewski by the right vistula bank , in praga .

in 1927 a zoological garden ( ogród zoologiczny ) was established on the park grounds , and in 1952 a bear run , still open today .
the species richness is mainly due to the location of warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas ( natural forests , wetlands along the vistula ) as well as arable land , meadows and forests .
bielany forest , located within the borders of warsaw , is the remaining part of the masovian primeval forest .

the first remedial measure was the warsaw area enlargement ( 1951 ) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations : only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance ( like renowned specialists ) were allowed to get the registration , hence halving the population growth in the following years .
it also bolstered some kind of conviction among poles that varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital .
unfortunately this belief still lives on in poland ( although not as much as it used to be ) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore .
throughout its existence , warsaw has been a multi-cultural city .
according to the 1901 census , out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2 % were catholics , 35.7 % jews , 5 % greek orthodox christians and 2.8 % protestants .

most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the warsaw uprising of 1944. after the war , the new communist authorities of poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt .
the basic unit of territorial division in poland is a commune ( gmina ) .
tasks and privileges , which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats .
but for instance the districts in kraków do not have entitlements of powiat , so the registration numbers in kraków are of the same type for all districts .

the normans ( norman : nourmands ; french : normands ; latin : normanni ) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to normandy , a region in france .
the normans ( norman : nourmands ; french : normands ; latin : normanni ) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to normandy , a region in france .
they were descended from norse ( " norman " comes from " norseman " ) raiders and pirates from denmark , iceland and norway who , under their leader rollo , agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia .
they were descended from norse ( " norman " comes from " norseman " ) raiders and pirates from denmark , iceland and norway who , under their leader rollo , agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia .
the distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries .
norman adventurers founded the kingdom of sicily under roger ii after conquering southern italy on the saracens and byzantines , and an expedition on behalf of their duke , william the conqueror , led to the norman conquest of england at the battle of hastings in 1066. norman cultural and military influence spread from these new european centres to the crusader states of the near east , where their prince bohemond i founded the principality of antioch in the levant , to scotland and wales in great britain , to ireland , and to the coasts of north africa and the canary islands .
the duchy of normandy , which they formed by treaty with the french crown , was a great fief of medieval france , and under richard i of normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure .
the normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their christian piety , becoming exponents of the catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated .
the english name " normans " comes from the french words normans/normanz , plural of normant , modern french normand , which is itself borrowed from old low franconian nortmann " northman " or directly from old norse norðmaðr , latinized variously as nortmannus , normannus , or nordmannus ( recorded in medieval latin , 9th century ) to mean " norseman , viking " .

the duchy of normandy , which began in 911 as a fiefdom , was established by the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte between king charles iii of west francia and the famed viking ruler rollo , and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of neustria .
the duchy of normandy , which began in 911 as a fiefdom , was established by the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte between king charles iii of west francia and the famed viking ruler rollo , and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of neustria .
the area corresponded to the northern part of present-day upper normandy down to the river seine , but the duchy would eventually extend west beyond the seine .
before rollo 's arrival , its populations did not differ from picardy or the île-de-france , which were considered " frankish " .
the descendants of rollo 's vikings and their frankish wives would replace the norse religion and old norse language with catholicism ( christianity ) and the gallo-romance language of the local people , blending their maternal frankish heritage with old norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique " norman " culture in the north of france .

most norman knights remained poor and land-hungry , and by 1066 normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation .
in 999 , according to amatus of montecassino , norman pilgrims returning from jerusalem called in at the port of salerno when a saracen attack occurred .
william of apulia tells that , in 1016 , norman pilgrims to the shrine of the archangel michael at monte gargano were met by melus of bari , a lombard nobleman and rebel , who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the byzantine rule , which they did .

the drengot family thereafter attained the principality of capua , and emperor henry iii legally ennobled the hauteville leader , drogo , as " dux et magister italiae comesque normannorum totius apuliae et calabriae " ( " duke and master of italy and count of the normans of all apulia and calabria " ) in 1047 .
he promptly awarded their elected leader , william iron arm , with the title of count in his capital of melfi .
from these bases , the normans eventually captured sicily and malta from the saracens , under the leadership of the famous robert guiscard , a hauteville , and his younger brother roger the great count .
roger 's son , roger ii of sicily , was crowned king in 1130 ( exactly one century after rainulf was " crowned " count ) by antipope anacletus ii .
the normans left their legacy in many castles , such as william iron arm 's citadel at squillace , and cathedrals , such as roger ii 's cappella palatina chapel at palermo , which dot the landscape and give a wholly distinct architectural flavor to accompany its unique history .
one of the great geographical treatises of the middle ages , the " tabula rogeriana " , was written by the andalusian al-idrisi for king roger ii of sicily , and entitled " kitab rudjdjar " ( " the book of roger " ) .

under this state , there was great religious freedom , and alongside the norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of jews , muslims and christians , both catholic and eastern orthodox .
soon after the normans began to enter italy , they entered the byzantine empire and then armenia , fighting against the pechenegs , the bulgars , and especially the seljuk turks .
one of the first norman mercenaries to serve as a byzantine general was hervé in the 1050s .
in the 1060s , robert crispin led the normans of edessa against the turks .
roussel de bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in asia minor with support from the local population , but he was stopped by the byzantine general alexius komnenos .
they even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle : afranji , meaning " franks . "
a norman named oursel led a force of " franks " into the upper euphrates valley in northern syria .
some normans joined turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the armenians vassal-states of sassoun and taron in far eastern anatolia .
several families of byzantine greece were of norman mercenary origin during the period of the comnenian restoration , when byzantine emperors were seeking out western european warriors .
robert guiscard , an other norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of apulia as the result of his military successes , ultimately drove the byzantines out of southern italy .
the city 's garrison resisted until february 1082 , when dyrrachium was betrayed to the normans by the venetian and amalfitan merchants who had settled there .
after allying himself with croatia and the catholic cities of dalmatia , in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of albania , capturing valona , kanina , jericho ( orikumi ) , and reaching butrint after numerous pillages .
meanwhile , they occupied petrela , the citadel of mili at the banks of the river deabolis , gllavenica ( ballsh ) , kanina and jericho .
a few years after the first crusade , in 1107 , the normans under the command of bohemond , robert 's son , landed in valona and besieged dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time , but to no avail .

the further decline of byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185 , when a large norman army invaded dyrrachium , owing to the betrayal of high byzantine officials .

some time later , dyrrachium—one of the most important naval bases of the adriatic—fell again to byzantine hands .
this relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of emma , sister of duke richard ii of normandy , and king ethelred ii of england .

one of the claimants of the english throne opposing william the conqueror , edgar atheling , eventually fled to scotland .
king malcolm iii of scotland married edgar 's sister margaret , and came into opposition to william who had already disputed scotland 's southern borders .
william invaded scotland in 1072 , riding as far as abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships .
malcolm submitted , paid homage to william and surrendered his son duncan as a hostage , beginning a series of arguments as to whether the scottish crown owed allegiance to the king of england .
king david i of scotland , whose elder brother alexander i had married sybilla of normandy , was instrumental in introducing normans and norman culture to scotland , part of the process some scholars call the " davidian revolution " .

these normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of wales was at some point subject to norman interference .
in 1018 , roger de tosny travelled to the iberian peninsula to carve out a state for himself from moorish lands , but failed .
in 1064 , during the war of barbastro , william of montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty .
after the successful siege of antioch in 1097 , bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city .
in 1096 , crusaders passing by the siege of amalfi were joined by bohemond of taranto and his nephew tancred with an army of italo-normans .
tancred was instrumental in the conquest of jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the crusader kingdom in transjordan and the region of galilee .
the conquest of cyprus by the anglo-norman forces of the third crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island , which would be under western european domination for the following 380 years .
but a storm dispersed the fleet .
after some searching , it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus , together with the wrecks of several other ships , including the treasure ship .
in april 1191 richard the lion-hearted left messina with a large fleet in order to reach acre .
survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island 's despot isaac komnenos .
all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat .
isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains , because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons .
various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time , in particular guy de lusignan .
while in limassol , richard the lion-heart married berengaria of navarre , first-born daughter of king sancho vi of navarre .
the wedding was held on 12 may 1191 at the chapel of st. george and it was attended by richard 's sister joan , whom he had brought from sicily .
among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation : richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus , and berengaria queen of england and queen of cyprus as well .
it was only in 1489 that the venetians acquired full control of the island , which remained a christian stronghold until the fall of famagusta in 1571 .
shortly after the conquest , cyprus was sold to the knights templar and it was subsequently acquired , in 1192 , by guy de lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom .
between 1402 and 1405 , the expedition led by the norman noble jean de bethencourt and the poitevine gadifer de la salle conquered the canarian islands of lanzarote , fuerteventura and el hierro off the atlantic coast of africa .
bethencourt took the title of king of the canary islands , as vassal to henry iii of castile .
in 1418 , jean 's nephew maciot de bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to enrique pérez de guzmán , 2nd count de niebla .

the customary law of normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of jersey and guernsey in the channel islands .
norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues : these are the très ancien coutumier ( very ancient customary ) , authored between 1200 and 1245 ; and the grand coutumier de normandie ( great customary of normandy , originally summa de legibus normanniae in curia laïcali ) , authored between 1235 and 1245 .
they spread a unique romanesque idiom to england and italy , and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north french style fundamentally altered the military landscape .
their style was characterised by rounded arches , particularly over windows and doorways , and massive proportions .
in england , the period of norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the anglo-saxon and precedes the early gothic .

in southern italy , the normans incorporated elements of islamic , lombard , and byzantine building techniques into their own , initiating a unique style known as norman-arab architecture within the kingdom of sicily .
however , in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform , encouraging the cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits , especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts .

the french wars of religion in the 16th century and french revolution in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this norman creativity .
by far the most famous work of norman art is the bayeux tapestry , which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery .

it was commissioned by odo , the bishop of bayeux and first earl of kent , employing natives from kent who were learned in the nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the danish vikings .
many churches preserve sculptured fonts , capitals , and more importantly mosaics , which were common in norman italy and drew heavily on the greek heritage .
normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century .
at fécamp , under two italian abbots , william of volpiano and john of ravenna , the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught .
under the norman abbot robert de grantmesnil , several monks of saint-evroul fled to southern italy , where they were patronised by robert guiscard and established a latin monastery at sant'eufemia .

tesla 's demonstration of his induction motor and westinghouse 's subsequent licensing of the patent , both in 1888 , put tesla firmly on the " ac " side of the so-called " war of currents , " an electrical distribution battle being waged between thomas edison and george westinghouse that had been simmering since westinghouse 's first ac system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888. this started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with edison holding all the patents for dc and the incandescent light and westinghouse using his own patented ac system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the edison patent .

the acquisition of a feasible ac motor gave westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated ac system , but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of tesla 's motor had to be put on hold for a while .
the competition resulted in edison machine works pursuing ac development in 1890 and by 1892 thomas edison was no longer in control of his own company , which was consolidated into the conglomerate general electric and converting to an ac delivery system at that point .
in 1893 , george westinghouse won the bid to light the 1893 world 's columbian exposition in chicago with alternating current , beating out a general electric bid by one million dollars .

based on tesla 's advice and westinghouse 's demonstration that they could build a complete ac system at the columbian exposition , a contract for building a two-phase ac generating system at the niagara falls was awarded to westinghouse electric .
a further contract to build the ac distribution system was awarded to general electric .
tesla advised adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current .

although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare .
westinghouse convinced tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over tesla 's ac patents in exchange for westinghouse electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $ 216,000 ; this provided westinghouse a break from what , due to alternating current 's rapid gain in popularity , had turned out to be an overly generous $ 2.50 per ac horsepower royalty .

starting in 1894 , tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of " invisible " kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments ( later identified as " roentgen rays " or " x-rays " ) .
soon after , much of tesla 's early research—hundreds of invention models , plans , notes , laboratory data , tools , photographs , valued at $ 50,000—was lost in the 5th avenue laboratory fire of march 1895. tesla is quoted by the new york times as saying , " i am in too much grief to talk .
tesla may have inadvertently captured an x-ray image—predating , by a few weeks , wilhelm röntgen 's december 1895 announcement of the discovery of x-rays—when he tried to photograph mark twain illuminated by a geissler tube , an earlier type of gas discharge tube .
the only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens .

tesla held that , with his circuits , the " instrument will ... enable one to generate roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus . "
tesla incorrectly believed that x-rays were longitudinal waves , such as those produced in waves in plasmas .
he believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the roentgen rays , but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin , and to a lesser extent , by nitrous acid .

" tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body , and again at the place where it passed out . "
in comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his " electric gun , " tesla said , " the particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations . "
tesla 's theories on the possibility of the transmission by radio waves go back as far as lectures and demonstrations in 1893 in st. louis , missouri , the franklin institute in philadelphia , pennsylvania , and the national electric light association .

on 17 may 1899 , tesla moved to colorado springs , where he would have room for his high-voltage , high-frequency experiments ; his lab was located near foote ave. and kiowa st. he chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it .
upon his arrival , he told reporters that he was conducting wireless telegraphy experiments , transmitting signals from pikes peak to paris .
on 15 june 1899 , tesla performed his first experiments at his colorado springs lab ; he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long , but very thick and noisy .

tesla investigated atmospheric electricity , observing lightning signals via his receivers .
he stated that he observed stationary waves during this time .
the great distances and the nature of what tesla was detecting from lightning storms confirmed his belief that the earth had a resonant frequency .
he produced artificial lightning , with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long .

thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in cripple creek , colorado .
light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off .
butterflies were electrified , swirling in circles with blue halos of st. elmo 's fire around their wings .
while experimenting , tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator , causing a power outage .
in august 1917 , tesla explained what had happened in the electrical experimenter : " as an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated , it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out , due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them , and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation !

during his time at his lab , tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded may be communications from another planet .
reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion tesla was hearing signals from mars .
he expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 february 1901 collier 's weekly article " talking with planets " where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing " intelligently controlled signals " and that the signals could come from mars , venus , or other planets .
it has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted marconi 's european experiments in july 1899—marconi may have transmitted the letter s ( dot/dot/dot ) in a naval demonstration , the same three impulses that tesla hinted at hearing in colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission .

tesla later approached morgan to ask for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter .
when asked where all the money had gone , tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the panic of 1901 , which he ( morgan ) had caused .
morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by tesla 's breach of contract by asking for more funds .
over the next five years , tesla wrote over 50 letters to morgan , pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of wardenclyffe .

during 1910–1911 at the waterside power station in new york , several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp .
tesla invented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator—tesla 's oscillator .
while experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his houston street lab , tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings .
as the speed grew , it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and , belatedly realizing the danger , he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment , just as the police arrived .
:162–164 in february 1912 , an article— " nikola tesla , dreamer " by allan l. benson—was published in world today , in which an artist 's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption , " tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth 's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization .
a continuation of this process would , he says , eventually split the earth in two . "
tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence .
in 1912 , he crafted " a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity , " wiring the walls of a schoolroom and , " saturating [ the schoolroom ] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency .
the plan was , at least provisionally approved by then superintendent of new york city schools , william h. maxwell .

" :245 there were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that tesla and/or edison had refused the prize .
:245 the nobel foundation said , " any rumor that a person has not been given a nobel prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous " ; a recipient could only decline a nobel prize after he is announced a winner .
there have been subsequent claims by tesla biographers that edison and tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other ; that each sought to minimize the other 's achievements and right to win the award ; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first ; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it ; and even that a wealthy edison refused it to keep tesla from getting the $ 20,000 prize money .
in the years after these rumors , neither tesla nor edison won the prize ( although edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and tesla did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1937 ) .

computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty , and relating those classes to each other .
a problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources , whatever the algorithm used .
the theory formalizes this intuition , by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them , such as time and storage .

other complexity measures are also used , such as the amount of communication ( used in communication complexity ) , the number of gates in a circuit ( used in circuit complexity ) and the number of processors ( used in parallel computing ) .
one of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and can not do .

a key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem , whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem .

the input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , and should not be confused with the problem itself .
the input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , and should not be confused with the problem itself .
in contrast , an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance , which can serve as the input for a decision problem .
a computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance .
a computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance .
to further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance , consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem : is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of germany 's 15 largest cities ?
the quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem , such as asking for a round trip through all sites in milan whose total length is at most 10 km .
for this reason , complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances .
when considering computational problems , a problem instance is a string over an alphabet .
usually , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet ( i.e. , the set { 0,1 } ) , and thus the strings are bitstrings .
usually , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet ( i.e. , the set { 0,1 } ) , and thus the strings are bitstrings .
for example , integers can be represented in binary notation , and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices , or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary .

decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory .
a decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no , or alternately either 1 or 0. a decision problem can be viewed as a formal language , where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes , and the non-members are those instances whose output is no .

the input is an arbitrary graph .
the formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs—of course , to obtain a precise definition of this language , one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings .

a function problem is a computational problem where a single output ( of a total function ) is expected for every input , but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem , that is , it is n't just yes or no .

a function problem is a computational problem where a single output ( of a total function ) is expected for every input , but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem , that is , it is n't just yes or no .
it is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems .
for example , the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples ( a , b , c ) such that the relation a × b = c holds .
to measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem , one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem .
however , the running time may , in general , depend on the instance .
thus the time required to solve a problem ( or the space required , or any measure of complexity ) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance .
this is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits .
complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size .
cobham 's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm .
if the input size is n , the time taken can be expressed as a function of n. since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different , the worst-case time complexity t ( n ) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n. if t ( n ) is a polynomial in n , then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm .

a turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine .
it is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm , there exists a turing machine that solves the problem .
since turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically , and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation , the turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory .
it is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape .
a deterministic turing machine is the most basic turing machine , which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions .
a deterministic turing machine is the most basic turing machine , which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions .
a probabilistic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an extra supply of random bits .
a non-deterministic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism , which allows a turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state .
algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms .
many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes , such as deterministic turing machines , probabilistic turing machines , non-deterministic turing machines , quantum turing machines , symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines .
they are all equally powerful in principle , but when resources ( such as time or space ) are bounded , some of these may be more powerful than others .
many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes , such as deterministic turing machines , probabilistic turing machines , non-deterministic turing machines , quantum turing machines , symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines .
many machine models different from the standard multi-tape turing machines have been proposed in the literature , for example random access machines .
perhaps surprisingly , each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power .
the time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary .
what all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically .
for example , a non-deterministic turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once .
however , some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources .
the non-deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze , so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems .
the non-deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze , so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems .
the time required by a deterministic turing machine m on input x is the total number of state transitions , or steps , the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ( " yes " or " no " ) .
since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty , one defines sets of problems based on some criteria .
for instance , the set of problems solvable within time f ( n ) on a deterministic turing machine is then denoted by dtime ( f ( n ) ) .
for a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space , a computational model such as the deterministic turing machine is used .
although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources , any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource .

to classify the computation time ( or similar resources , such as space consumption ) , one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem .
analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms .
to classify the computation time ( or similar resources , such as space consumption ) , one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem .
to show an upper bound t ( n ) on the time complexity of a problem , one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most t ( n ) .
however , proving lower bounds is much more difficult , since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem .
upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation , which hides constant factors and smaller terms .
upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation , which hides constant factors and smaller terms .
for instance , if t ( n ) = 7n2 + 15n + 40 , in big o notation one would write t ( n ) = o ( n2 ) .
this makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used .
of course , some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework .

but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f ( n ) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model .
for instance , the language { xx | x is any binary string } can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape turing machine , but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape turing machines .

if we allow polynomial variations in running time , cobham-edmonds thesis states that " the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related " ( goldreich 2008 , chapter 1.2 ) .
this forms the basis for the complexity class p , which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic turing machine within polynomial time .
many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm .

# p is an important complexity class of counting problems ( not decision problems ) .
classes like ip and am are defined using interactive proof systems .
for the complexity classes defined in this way , it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on ( say ) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems .
in particular , although dtime ( n ) is contained in dtime ( n2 ) , it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict .
for time and space requirements , the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively .
they are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources .
having deduced such proper set inclusions , we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved .
the time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes .
for instance , the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime , and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace .
for instance , the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime , and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace .
many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction .
a reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem .
for instance , if a problem x can be solved using an algorithm for y , x is no more difficult than y , and we say that x reduces to y. there are many different types of reductions , based on the method of reduction , such as cook reductions , karp reductions and levin reductions , and the bound on the complexity of reductions , such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions .

the most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction .
for example , the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers .
this means that the reduction process takes polynomial time .
indeed , this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm .

a problem x is hard for a class of problems c if every problem in c can be reduced to x. thus no problem in c is harder than x , since an algorithm for x allows us to solve any problem in c. of course , the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used .

in particular , the set of problems that are hard for np is the set of np-hard problems .
if a problem x is in c and hard for c , then x is said to be complete for c. this means that x is the hardest problem in c. ( since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that x is one of the hardest problems in c. ) thus the class of np-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in np , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in p. because the problem p = np is not solved , being able to reduce a known np-complete problem , π2 , to another problem , π1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for π1 .

the complexity class p is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm .
this hypothesis is called the cobham–edmonds thesis .
the complexity class np , on the other hand , contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently , but for which no efficient algorithm is known , such as the boolean satisfiability problem , the hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem .

since deterministic turing machines are special non-deterministic turing machines , it is easily observed that each problem in p is also member of the class np .
if the answer is yes , many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions .
these include various types of integer programming problems in operations research , many problems in logistics , protein structure prediction in biology , and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems .
there is a us $ 1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem .
it was shown by ladner that if p ≠ np then there exist problems in np that are neither in p nor np-complete .
such problems are called np-intermediate problems .
the graph isomorphism problem , the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be np-intermediate .
the graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic .
an important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in p , np-complete , or np-intermediate .
if graph isomorphism is np-complete , the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level .
if graph isomorphism is np-complete , the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level .
the best algorithm for this problem , due to laszlo babai and eugene luks has run time 2o ( √ ( n log ( n ) ) ) for graphs with n vertices .
the integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer .
phrased as a decision problem , it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known , and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems , such as the rsa algorithm .
phrased as a decision problem , it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known , and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems , such as the rsa algorithm .
the best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve , which takes time o ( e ( 64/9 ) 1/3 ( n.log 2 ) 1/3 ( log ( n.log 2 ) ) 2/3 ) to factor an n-bit integer .
many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal , but this has not been proved .
for instance p ⊆ np ⊆ pp ⊆ pspace , but it is possible that p = pspace .
since there are many known complexity classes between p and pspace , such as rp , bpp , pp , bqp , ma , ph , etc. , it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class .
proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory .
along the same lines , co-np is the class containing the complement problems ( i.e .
problems with the yes/no answers reversed ) of np problems .
it is believed that np is not equal to co-np ; however , it has not yet been proven .
it has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then p is not equal to np .
similarly , it is not known if l ( the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space ) is strictly contained in p or equal to p. again , there are many complexity classes between the two , such as nl and nc , and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes .

problems that can be solved in theory ( e.g. , given large but finite time ) , but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful , are known as intractable problems .
to see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice , consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting .
if np is not the same as p , then the np-complete problems are also intractable in this sense .
for example , the decision problem in presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in p , yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases .
for example , the decision problem in presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in p , yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases .
similarly , algorithms can solve the np-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and sat solvers routinely handle large instances of the np-complete boolean satisfiability problem .

before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off , numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers .
most influential among these was the definition of turing machines by alan turing in 1936 , which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer .

perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children .
in primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum .
in secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers .
perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children .
the relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor , specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day .
however , alternative approaches for primary education do exist .
one of these , sometimes referred to as a " platoon " system , involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject .
students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes .
the advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects .
this is true throughout most of the united states as well .
co-teaching has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions .
co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom .
co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential .

whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics , some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline .
this viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries—in east asia for instance—that combine strict discipline with high standards of education .
[ citation needed ] such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently .

sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike .
sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike .
primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole , thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation , rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront .
they also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else .
sudbury model democratic schools ' proponents argue that a school that has good , clear laws , fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community , and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws , is a school in which community discipline prevails , and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops , against other schools today , where rules are arbitrary , authority is absolute , punishment is capricious , and due process of law is unknown .
since teachers can affect how students perceive the course materials , it has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials .
on teacher/course evaluations , it was found that teachers who have a positive disposition towards the course content tend to transfer their passion to receptive students .
these teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis .
students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who did n't show much enthusiasm for the course materials .
recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students ' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom .
students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom .

hans hillerbrand writes that luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly " searching , rather than doctrinaire . "
hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in thesis 86 , which asks : " why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest crassus , build the basilica of st. peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money ? "
luther objected to a saying attributed to johann tetzel that " as soon as the coin in the coffer rings , the soul from purgatory ( also attested as 'into heaven ' ) springs . "

he insisted that , since forgiveness was god 's alone to grant , those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error .

however , this oft-quoted saying of tetzel was by no means representative of contemporary catholic teaching on indulgences , but rather a reflection of his capacity to exaggerate .

this early part of luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive .
three of his best-known works were published in 1520 : to the christian nobility of the german nation , on the babylonian captivity of the church , and on the freedom of a christian .

from 1510 to 1520 , luther lectured on the psalms , the books of hebrews , romans , and galatians .
as he studied these portions of the bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the catholic church in new ways .
he became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of christianity .

the most important for luther was the doctrine of justification – god 's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through god 's grace .
luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of god .
this teaching by luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication on the bondage of the will , which was written in response to on free will by desiderius erasmus ( 1524 ) .
faith , for luther , was a gift from god ; the experience of being justified by faith was " as though i had been born again . "
he explained his concept of " justification " in the smalcald articles :
his entry into paradise , no less , was a discovery about " the righteousness of god " – a discovery that " the just person " of whom the bible speaks ( as in romans 1:17 ) lives by faith .

archbishop albrecht of mainz and magdeburg did not reply to luther 's letter containing the 95 theses .
he had the theses checked for heresy and in december 1517 forwarded them to rome .
he needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric .
as luther later noted , " the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of st peter 's church in rome " .
he had the theses checked for heresy and in december 1517 forwarded them to rome .
pope leo x was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , " with great care as is proper . "
over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti-papal theology .
there , in october 1518 , under questioning by papal legate cardinal cajetan luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical church because historistical interpretation of bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the antichrist .
there , in october 1518 , under questioning by papal legate cardinal cajetan luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical church because historistical interpretation of bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the antichrist .
cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so .
in january 1519 , at altenburg in saxony , the papal nuncio karl von miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach .
luther made certain concessions to the saxon , who was a relative of the elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did .
the theologian johann eck , however , was determined to expose luther 's doctrine in a public forum .
luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible .
for this , eck branded luther a new jan hus , referring to the czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415. from that moment , he devoted himself to luther 's defeat .
on 15 june 1520 , the pope warned luther with the papal bull ( edict ) exsurge domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 theses , within 60 days .

karl von miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but luther , who had sent the pope a copy of on the freedom of a christian in october , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at wittenberg on 10 december 1520 , an act he defended in why the pope and his recent book are burned and assertions concerning all articles .
as a consequence , luther was excommunicated by pope leo x on 3 january 1521 , in the bull decet romanum pontificem .
the enforcement of the ban on the 95 theses fell to the secular authorities .
on 18 april 1521 , luther appeared as ordered before the diet of worms .
this was a general assembly of the estates of the holy roman empire that took place in worms , a town on the rhine .
it was conducted from 28 january to 25 may 1521 , with emperor charles v presiding .
prince frederick iii , elector of saxony , obtained a safe conduct for luther to and from the meeting .
johann eck , speaking on behalf of the empire as assistant of the archbishop of trier , presented luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents .

he prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day :
luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question .

recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable , since they were inserted before " may god help me " only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings .
however , mullett suggests that given his nature , " we are free to believe that luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words . "
over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine luther 's fate .
the emperor presented the final draft of the edict of worms on 25 may 1521 , declaring luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest : " we want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic . "

it permitted anyone to kill luther without legal consequence .
luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to wittenberg was planned .
they escorted luther to the security of the wartburg castle at eisenach .
during his stay at wartburg , which he referred to as " my patmos " , luther translated the new testament from greek into german and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings .

these included a renewed attack on archbishop albrecht of mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a " refutation of the argument of latomus , " in which he expounded the principle of justification to jacobus latomus , an orthodox theologian from louvain .
in this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract god 's favor is a sin .
all humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and god 's grace ( which can not be earned ) alone can make them just .
on 1 august 1521 , luther wrote to melanchthon on the same theme : " be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in christ be stronger , and rejoice in christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world .

we will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides . "
in the summer of 1521 , luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of church practices .
in on the abrogation of the private mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation .

his essay on confession , whether the pope has the power to require it rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since " every christian is a confessor . "
he assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation .
in 1521 luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the reformation placing them on prophetic faith .

the reforms provoked disturbances , including a revolt by the augustinian friars against their prior , the smashing of statues and images in churches , and denunciations of the magistracy .
wittenberg became even more volatile after christmas when a band of visionary zealots , the so-called zwickau prophets , arrived , preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man , adult baptism , and christ 's imminent return .
when the town council asked luther to return , he decided it was his duty to act .
luther secretly returned to wittenberg on 6 march 1522. he wrote to the elector : " during my absence , satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which i can not repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word . "

for eight days in lent , beginning on invocavit sunday , 9 march , luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the " invocavit sermons " .
in these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust god 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change .
the effect of luther 's intervention was immediate .
after the sixth sermon , the wittenberg jurist jerome schurf wrote to the elector : " oh , what joy has dr. martin 's return spread among us !

luther sympathised with some of the peasants ' grievances , as he showed in his response to the twelve articles in may 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities .
during a tour of thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops ' palaces , and libraries .
in against the murderous , thieving hordes of peasants , written on his return to wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs :

luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds .
first , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring christ 's counsel to " render unto caesar the things that are caesar 's " ; st. paul had written in his epistle to the romans 13:1–7 that all authorities are appointed by god and therefore should not be resisted .

this reference from the bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the divine right of kings , or , in the german case , the divine right of the princes .
second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants " outside the law of god and empire " , so they deserved " death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers . "
without luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons ; others felt betrayed .
their defeat by the swabian league at the battle of frankenhausen on 15 may 1525 , followed by müntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the reformation to a close .

thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while luther 's reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers .

his biblical ideal of congregations ' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable .

luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation : as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into system .
to avoid confusing or upsetting the people , luther avoided extreme change .
he concentrated on the church in the electorate of saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his saxon model .

he worked closely with the new elector , john the steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with rome .
for luther 's biographer martin brecht , this partnership " was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign " .
in response to demands for a german liturgy , luther wrote a german mass , which he published in early 1526. he did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the latin mass but as an alternative for the " simple people " , a " public stimulation for people to believe and become christians .

"
luther based his order on the catholic service but omitted " everything that smacks of sacrifice " ; and the mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread .
he retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony .

luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of christianity to the congregations .
in 1529 , he wrote the large catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the small catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves .

luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of christian faith would not just be learned by rote , " the way monkeys do it " , but understood .
the catechism is one of luther 's most personal works .
" regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , " he wrote , " i am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a saturnian hunger , i would rather see them all devoured .
for i acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the bondage of the will and the catechism . "
the small catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching .
it remains in use today , along with luther 's hymns and his translation of the bible .
luther 's small catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children ; likewise the larger catechism was effective for pastors .

using the german vernacular , they expressed the apostles ' creed in simpler , more personal , trinitarian language .
that is , luther depicted the trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known .
salvation originates with the father and draws the believer to the father .
luther had published his german translation of the new testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the old testament in 1534 , when the whole bible was published .

he continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life .
when he was criticised for inserting the word " alone " after " faith " in romans 3:28 , he replied in part : " [ t ] he text itself and the meaning of st. paul urgently require and demand it .
... but when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , 'faith alone justifies us , and not works ' . "

published at a time of rising demand for german-language publications , luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential bible translation .
as such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the german language and literature .
furnished with notes and prefaces by luther , and with woodcuts by lucas cranach that contained anti-papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of luther 's doctrine throughout germany .
the luther bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as william tyndale 's english bible ( 1525 forward ) , a precursor of the king james bible .
luther was a prolific hymn-writer , authoring hymns such as " ein feste burg ist unser gott " ( " a mighty fortress is our god " ) , based on psalm 46 , and " vom himmel hoch , da komm ich her " ( " from heaven above to earth i come " ) , based on luke 2:11–12 .
luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children .
his tool of choice for this connection was the singing of german hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena .
he often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of germany in the 20th century .

luther 's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding reformation .
this behavior started with his learning of the execution of johann esch and heinrich voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the roman catholic church for lutheran views , prompting luther to write the hymn " ein neues lied wir heben an " ( " a new song we raise " ) , which is generally known in english by john c. messenger 's translation by the title and first line " flung to the heedless winds " and sung to the tune ibstone composed in 1875 by maria c. tiddeman .

luther 's 1524 creedal hymn " wir glauben all an einen gott " ( " we all believe in one true god " ) is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring luther 's 1529 three-part explanation of the apostles ' creed in the small catechism .

luther 's hymn , adapted and expanded from an earlier german creedal hymn , gained widespread use in vernacular lutheran liturgies as early as 1525. sixteenth-century lutheran hymnals also included " wir glauben all " among the catechetical hymns , although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as trinitarian rather than catechetical , and 20th-century lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune .

luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the lord 's prayer , " vater unser im himmelreich " , corresponds exactly to luther 's explanation of the prayer in the small catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas .

the hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the lord 's prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions .
the extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune .
other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the lord 's prayer have adopted luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter .
luther wrote " aus tiefer not schrei ich zu dir " ( " from depths of woe i cry to you " ) in 1523 as a hymnic version of psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in german worship .

in a collaboration with paul speratus , this and seven other hymns were published in the achtliederbuch , the first lutheran hymnal .
because it expressed essential reformation doctrine , this expanded version of " aus tiefer not " was designated as a regular component of several regional lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals , including luther 's own .
" nun komm , der heiden heiland " ( now come , savior of the gentiles ) , based on veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn ( hauptlied ) for advent .

he wrote two hymns on the ten commandments , " dies sind die heilgen zehn gebot " and " mensch , willst du leben seliglich " .
it became known as the german te deum .
luther 's 1541 hymn " christ unser herr zum jordan kam " ( " to jordan came the christ our lord " ) reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the small catechism .
luther adopted a preexisting johann walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of psalm 67 's prayer for grace ; wolf heintz 's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the lutheran reformation in halle in 1541. preachers and composers of the 18th century , including j. s. bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century lutheran pietism .

johann sebastian bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely christ lag in todes banden , bwv 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle ( 1724 to 1725 ) ach gott , vom himmel sieh darein , bwv 2 , christ unser herr zum jordan kam , bwv 7 , nun komm , der heiden heiland , bwv 62 , gelobet seist du , jesu christ , bwv 91 , and aus tiefer not schrei ich zu dir , bwv 38 , later ein feste burg ist unser gott , bwv 80 , and in 1735 wär gott nicht mit uns diese zeit , bwv 14 .

in contrast to the views of john calvin and philipp melanchthon , throughout his life luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death ; and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and lazarus .
this also led luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints : " it is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace . "

he also rejected the existence of purgatory , which involved christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death .
in his smalcald articles , he described the saints as currently residing " in their graves and in heaven . "
the lutheran theologian franz pieper observed that luther 's teaching about the state of the christian 's soul after death differed from the later lutheran theologians such as johann gerhard .

luther 's commentary on genesis contains a passage which concludes that " the soul does not sleep ( anima non sic dormit ) , but wakes ( sed vigilat ) and experiences visions " .
francis blackburne in 1765 argued that john jortin misread this and other passages from luther , while gottfried fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man " in this life " ( homo enim in hac vita ) tired from his daily labour ( defatigus diurno labore ) who at night enters his bedchamber ( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum ) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .

agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the eucharist – the sacrament of the lord 's supper—an issue crucial to luther .

the theologians , including zwingli , melanchthon , martin bucer , and johannes oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by jesus at the last supper : " this is my body which is for you " and " this cup is the new covenant in my blood " ( 1 corinthians 11:23–26 ) .
luther insisted on the real presence of the body and blood of christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed god to be only spiritually or symbolically present .

according to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational .
despite the disagreements on the eucharist , the marburg colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the augsburg confession , and for the formation of the schmalkaldic league the following year by leading protestant nobles such as john of saxony , philip of hesse , and george , margrave of brandenburg-ansbach .

and " [ that ] reason in no way contributes to faith .
[ ... ] for reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . "
luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .
in 1523 , luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ .
however , as the reformation continued , luther began to lose hope in large-scale jewish conversion to christianity .
in his later years , luther grew more hostile toward the jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists , zwinglianism , and the papacy .

his 1543 treatise von den juden und ihren lügen ( on the jews and their lies ) took its place among other anti-jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century europe .
he saw the turks as a scourge sent to punish christians by god , as agents of the biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist , whom luther believed to be the papacy , and the roman church .

by 1529 , in on war against the turk , he was actively urging emperor charles v and the german people to fight a secular war against the turks .
in 1542 , luther read a latin translation of the qur'an .
he went on to produce several critical pamphlets on islam , which he called " mohammedanism " or " the turk " .
he went on to produce several critical pamphlets on islam , which he called " mohammedanism " or " the turk " .
though luther saw the muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice : " let the turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false christians live . "
he opposed banning the publication of the qur'an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny .
early in 1537 , johannes agricola ( 1494–1566 ) – serving at the time as pastor in luther 's birthplace , eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that god 's gospel , not god 's moral law ( the ten commandments ) , revealed god 's wrath to christians .
early in 1537 , johannes agricola ( 1494–1566 ) – serving at the time as pastor in luther 's birthplace , eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that god 's gospel , not god 's moral law ( the ten commandments ) , revealed god 's wrath to christians .
these theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to christians but belonged only to city hall .
luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against agricola and the antinomians , four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540. he also responded to these assertions in other writings , such as his 1539 open letter to c. güttel against the antinomians , and his book on the councils and the church from the same year .

in his theses and disputations against the antinomians , luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the " second use of the law , " that is , the law as the holy spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel .

luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is christ 's life , christ 's death for sin , or god 's goodness experienced in creation .
simply refusing to preach the ten commandments among christians – thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law .
claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people .
on the other hand , luther also points out that the ten commandments – when considered not as god 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law – also positively teach how the christian ought to live .

this has traditionally been called the " third use of the law . "
for luther , also christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the ten commandments , which a christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis .

the ten commandments , and the beginnings of the renewed life of christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism , are a present foreshadowing of the believers ' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life .
luther 's teaching of the ten commandments , therefore , has clear eschatological overtones , which , characteristically for luther , do not encourage world-flight but direct the christian to service to the neighbor in the common , daily vocations of this perishing world .
from december 1539 , luther became implicated in the bigamy of philip i , landgrave of hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting .

in the view of luther 's biographer martin brecht , " giving confessional advice for philip of hesse was one of the worst mistakes luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds luther accountable " .
the affair caused lasting damage to luther 's reputation .
luther rarely encountered jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled jews some ninety years earlier .

he considered the jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of jesus , whereas christians believed jesus was the messiah .
in 1523 , luther advised kindness toward the jews in that jesus christ was born a jew and also aimed to convert them to christianity .
luther 's other major works on the jews were his 60,000-word treatise von den juden und ihren lügen ( on the jews and their lies ) , and vom schem hamphoras und vom geschlecht christi ( on the holy name and the lineage of christ ) , both published in 1543 , three years before his death .

luther argued that the jews were no longer the chosen people but " the devil 's people " , and referred to them with violent , vile language .
in robert michael 's view , luther 's words " we are at fault in not slaying them " amounted to a sanction for murder .
luther spoke out against the jews in saxony , brandenburg , and silesia .
josel of rosheim , the jewish spokesman who tried to help the jews of saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on " that priest whose name was martin luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! —who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the jews was doomed to perdition .

josel asked the city of strasbourg to forbid the sale of luther 's anti-jewish works : they refused initially , but did so when a lutheran pastor in hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder jews .
throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of jews from several german lutheran states .
luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within germany he acquired the status of a prophet .
according to the prevailing view among historians , his anti-jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an " ideal underpinning " for the nazis ' attacks on jews .

heinrich himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the jews in 1940. the city of nuremberg presented a first edition of on the jews and their lies to julius streicher , editor of the nazi newspaper der stürmer , on his birthday in 1937 ; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-semitic tract ever published .

the german people , he urged , ought to heed these words " of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the jews . "
some scholars see luther 's influence as limited , and the nazis ' use of his work as opportunistic .

johannes wallmann argues that luther 's writings against the jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between luther 's thought and nazi ideology .

other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti-judaic—that is , opposed to judaism and its adherence rather than the jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard christian suspicion of judaism .
ronald berger writes that luther is credited with " germanizing the christian critique of judaism and establishing anti-semitism as a key element of german culture and national identity . "
paul rose argues that he caused a " hysterical and demonizing mentality " about jews to enter german thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent .
christopher j. probst in his book demonizing the jews : luther and the protestant church in nazi germany ( 2012 ) , shows that a large number of german lutheran clergy and theologians during the nazi third reich used luther 's hostile publications towards the jews and their jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-semitic policies of the national socialists .

the rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water , so that they may be run continuously .
utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps ; however , other types are used .
injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used , except in applications such as steam locomotives .

corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events ; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms .
this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler stephenson , joy and walschaerts motions .
the usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side , with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred .

near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use .
these stages were called expansions , with double and triple expansion engines being common , especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried .

steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating ( piston ) steam engines , with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine .

steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines ( for outputs above several hundred horsepower ) , have fewer moving parts , and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means .
in the united states 90 % of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources .
today most electric power is provided by steam turbines .
the heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources , most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space ( called variously combustion chamber , firebox ) .

in some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor , geothermal energy , solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process .
in the case of model or toy steam engines , the heat source can be an electric heating element .
the most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator .
early versions were in use by 1851 , but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer charles porter by charles richard and exhibited at london exhibition in 1862. the steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle , which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower .

with two-cylinder compounds used in railway work , the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other ( quartered ) .
when the double expansion group is duplicated , producing a 4-cylinder compound , the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180° , the groups being set at 90° to each other .

in most reciprocating piston engines , the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke ( counterflow ) , entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port .
the complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes ; the cycle also comprises four events – admission , expansion , exhaust , compression .

the quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas , while exhausting in cold areas .
uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where , during each stroke , the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam , whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature .
the aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction .
an oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder .
instead of valves , the entire cylinder rocks , or oscillates , such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting ( trunnion ) .
these engines are mainly used in toys and models , because of their simplicity , but have also been used in full size working engines , mainly on ships where their compactness is valued .

the working fluid in a rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system , where the working fluid is recycled continuously , or may be an " open loop " system , where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere , and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied .

mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine .
normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties , such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry , abundance , low cost , and its thermodynamic properties .
the efficiency of a rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid .
without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid , the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small ; in steam turbines , turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °c ( the creep limit of stainless steel ) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °c .

a method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by british engineer arthur woolf , who patented his woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805. in the compound engine , high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure ( hp ) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure ( lp ) cylinders .

by staging the expansion in multiple cylinders , torque variability can be reduced .
to derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume .
the main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation ( in the 1990s about 90 % of the world 's electric production was by use of steam turbines ) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80 % regime for steam turbines .
in marine service , ( pioneered on the turbinia ) , steam turbines with reduction gearing ( although the turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox ) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century , being more efficient ( and requiring far less maintenance ) than reciprocating steam engines .

the rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine .
the heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser .
in the 1990s , rankine steam cycles generated about 90 % of all electric power used throughout the world , including virtually all solar , biomass , coal and nuclear power plants .

it is named after william john macquorn rankine , a scottish polymath .
the historical measure of a steam engine 's energy efficiency was its " duty " .
watt 's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million , but averaged about 17. this was a three-fold improvement over the average newcomen design .
the best examples of newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million , but most were closer to 5 million .
duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel ( 94 pounds ) of coal .
the concept of duty was first introduced by watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier newcomen designs .

a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly .
evaporative ( wet ) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water ; this water is kept separate from the condensate , which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler .
evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than " once-through " cooling by river or lake water ; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling , but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water .

as a consequence , engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed , such as cotton spinning .
the governor could not actually hold a set speed , because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes .

most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually " shortening the cutoff " or rather , shortening the admission event ; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period .
however , as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows , a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant ; if the exhaust event is too brief , the totality of the exhaust steam can not evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression ( " kick back " ) .

the simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction .

typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute ( rpm ) in the usa with 60 hertz power , 3000 rpm in europe and other countries with 50 hertz electric power systems .
the weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines .
for mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors .
however , most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant , so that indirectly the world 's industry is still dependent on steam power .
this is becoming known as the advanced steam movement .
recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover .

they were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam , instead of the pressure of expanding steam .
steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high ; one may be adjusted by the user , the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe .
such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler .
the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve , which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken .

an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen ( see the filled π* orbitals in the diagram ) , orbitals that are of equal energy—i.e. , degenerate—is a configuration termed a spin triplet state .

both liquid and solid o 2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red ( in contrast with the blue color of the sky , which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light ) .
high-purity liquid o 2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air .
liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air , using liquid nitrogen as a coolant .

water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o 2 in eutrophic water bodies .
scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water 's biochemical oxygen demand , or the amount of o 2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration .
free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in earth 's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved , probably about 3.5 billion years ago .

dc electricity must be used : if ac is used , the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. contrary to popular belief , the 2:1 ratio observed in the dc electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is h2o unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves .
a similar method is the electrocatalytic o 2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids .
chemical catalysts can be used as well , such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines , and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies .

professional athletes , especially in american football , also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a " boost " in performance .
the pharmacological effect is doubtful ; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation .
available studies support a performance boost from enriched o 2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise .
hyperbaric ( high-pressure ) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of o 2 around the patient and , when needed , the medical staff .
increased o 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin .

oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema , pneumonia , some heart disorders ( congestive heart failure ) , some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure , and any disease that impairs the body 's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen .
treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient 's blood , but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs , easing work load on the heart .

oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas ; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting .
such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers , which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas .
there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen , including : acetone , methanol , ethanol , isopropanol , furan , thf , diethyl ether , dioxane , ethyl acetate , dmf , dmso , acetic acid , and formic acid .

acetone ( ( ch 3 ) 2co ) and phenol ( c 6h 5oh ) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances .
epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms .
among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are ( where " r " is an organic group ) : alcohols ( r-oh ) ; ethers ( r-o-r ) ; ketones ( r-co-r ) ; aldehydes ( r-co-h ) ; carboxylic acids ( r-cooh ) ; esters ( r-coo-r ) ; acid anhydrides ( r-co-o-co-r ) ; and amides ( r-c ( o ) -nr 2 ) .
the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to ( or generated by ) life .
only a few common complex biomolecules , such as squalene and the carotenes , contain no oxygen .
of the organic compounds with biological relevance , carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen .
all fats , fatty acids , amino acids , and proteins contain oxygen ( due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues ) .
oxygen also occurs in phosphate ( po3− 4 ) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules atp and adp , in the backbone and the purines ( except adenine ) and pyrimidines of rna and dna , and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite .
oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving .
prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o 2 partial pressure more than 60 kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis .
exposure to a o 2 partial pressures greater than 160 kpa ( about 1.6 atm ) may lead to convulsions ( normally fatal for divers ) .
acute oxygen toxicity ( causing seizures , its most feared effect for divers ) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 % o 2 at 66 m or more of depth ; the same thing can occur by breathing 100 % o 2 at only 6 m .

breathing pure o 2 in space applications , such as in some modern space suits , or in early spacecraft such as apollo , causes no damage due to the low total pressures used .
in the case of spacesuits , the o 2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is , in general , about 30 kpa ( 1.4 times normal ) , and the resulting o 2 partial pressure in the astronaut 's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level o 2 partial pressure ( for more information on this , see space suit and arterial blood gas ) .

oxygen gas ( o 2 ) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures , leading to convulsions and other health problems .
[ j ] oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals ( kpa ) , equal to about 50 % oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level o 2 partial pressure of about 21 kpa .

the 1973 oil crisis began in october 1973 when the members of the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries ( oapec , consisting of the arab members of opec plus egypt and syria ) proclaimed an oil embargo .
by the end of the embargo in march 1974 , the price of oil had risen from us $ 3 per barrel to nearly $ 12 globally ; us prices were significantly higher .
it was later called the " first oil shock " , followed by the 1979 oil crisis , termed the " second oil shock . "

some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott .
they arranged for israel to pull back from the sinai peninsula and the golan heights .
by january 18 , 1974 , us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula .
the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march 1974 .
on august 15 , 1971 , the united states unilaterally pulled out of the bretton woods accord .
the us abandoned the gold exchange standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar , whose value was left to " float " ( rise and fall according to market demand ) .
anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time , the industrialized nations increased their reserves ( by expanding their money supplies ) in amounts far greater than before .
in september 1971 , opec issued a joint communiqué stating that , from then on , they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold .
because oil was priced in dollars , oil producers ' real income decreased .
from 1947 to 1967 , the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year .
after 1971 , opec was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation .
the substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold .
until the oil shock , the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities .
on october 6 , 1973 , syria and egypt , with support from other arab nations , launched a surprise attack on israel , on yom kippur .
at the time , iran was the world 's second-largest oil exporter and a close us ally .
let 's say ten times more . "

this renewal of hostilities in the arab–israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices .
in response to american aid to israel , on october 16 , 1973 , opec raised the posted price of oil by 70 % , to $ 5.11 a barrel .
in response to american aid to israel , on october 16 , 1973 , opec raised the posted price of oil by 70 % , to $ 5.11 a barrel .
the following day , oil ministers agreed to the embargo , a cut in production by five percent from september 's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met .
on october 19 , nixon requested congress to appropriate $ 2.2 billion in emergency aid to israel , including $ 1.5 billion in outright grants .

much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions , particularly in the middle east .
some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities , amid shrinking western demand .

in the us production , distribution and price disruptions " have been held responsible for recessions , periods of excessive inflation , reduced productivity , and lower economic growth . "
in the united states , scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973. the possibility that the middle east could become another superpower confrontation with the ussr was of more concern to the us than oil .

further , interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for kissinger 's dominance .
the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to u.s. energy security .
on an international level , the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries , such as automobiles .
macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts .
the embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies , even in rugged terrain such as the arctic .
finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production .
of the nine members of the european economic community ( eec ) , the netherlands faced a complete embargo , the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies ( having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis ) , while the other six faced partial cutbacks .

the uk , germany , italy , switzerland and norway banned flying , driving and boating on sundays .
sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil .
price controls exacerbated the crisis in the us .
the system limited the price of " old oil " ( that which had already been discovered ) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment .

development of the strategic petroleum reserve began in 1975 , and in 1977 the cabinet-level department of energy was created , followed by the national energy act of 1978 .
the energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy , nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels .
there is criticism that american energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking , promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities .
instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation , congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient , but whose prospects are doubtful .
in 2004 , declassified documents revealed that the u.s. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize middle eastern oilfields in late 1973. although no explicit plan was mentioned , a conversation between u.s. secretary of defense james schlesinger and british ambassador to the united states lord cromer revealed schlesinger had told him that " it was no longer obvious to him that the u.s. could not use force . "
british prime minister edward heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a british intelligence estimate of u.s. intentions , which concluded america " might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the u.s. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries , " and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in saudi arabia and kuwait , and possibly abu dhabi in military action was decided upon .
although the soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force , intelligence warned " the american occupation would need to last 10 years as the west developed alternative energy sources , and would result in the ‘ total alienation ’ of the arabs and much of the rest of the third world . "

"
although lacking historical connections to the middle east , japan was the country most dependent on arab oil .
71 % of its imported oil came from the middle east in 1970. on november 7 , 1973 , the saudi and kuwaiti governments declared japan a " nonfriendly " country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy .
it received a 5 % production cut in december , causing a panic .
on november 22 , japan issued a statement " asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories , advocating palestinian self-determination , and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions " .
by december 25 , japan was considered an arab-friendly state .
the ussr 's invasion of afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region , also marked by increased american weapons sales , technology , and outright military presence .
saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats , including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues .
saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats , including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues .
another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the us by saudi arabia was the failure of the shah during january 1979 to maintain control of iran , a non-arabic but largely shiite muslim nation , which fell to a theocratic islamist government under the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in the wake of the 1979 iranian revolution .
in the wake of the iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of islamism , a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca by wahhabi extremists during november 1979 and a shiite revolt in the oil rich al-hasa region of saudi arabia in december of the same year .
the crisis reduced the demand for large cars .
japanese imports , primarily the toyota corona , the toyota corolla , the datsun b210 , the datsun 510 , the honda civic , the mitsubishi galant ( a captive import from chrysler sold as the dodge colt ) , the subaru dl , and later the honda accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical american v8 and six cylinder engines .

japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive , which became de facto standards .
a decade after the 1973 oil crisis , honda , toyota and nissan , affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints , opened us assembly plants and established their luxury divisions ( acura , lexus and infiniti , respectively ) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands .
some buyers lamented the small size of the first japanese compacts , and both toyota and nissan ( then known as datsun ) introduced larger cars such as the toyota corona mark ii , the toyota cressida , the mazda 616 and datsun 810 , which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning , power steering , am-fm radios , and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle .

compact trucks were introduced , such as the toyota hilux and the datsun truck , followed by the mazda truck ( sold as the ford courier ) , and the isuzu-built chevrolet luv .
mitsubishi rebranded its forte as the dodge d-50 a few years after the oil crisis .
mazda , mitsubishi and isuzu had joint partnerships with ford , chrysler , and gm , respectively .
later the american makers introduced their domestic replacements ( ford ranger , dodge dakota and the chevrolet s10/gmc s-15 ) , ending their captive import policy .
an increase in imported cars into north america forced general motors , ford and chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales .
the dodge omni / plymouth horizon from chrysler , the ford fiesta and the chevrolet chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s .
by 1985 , the average american vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon , compared to 13.5 in 1970. the improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $ 12 from 1974 to 1979. sales of large sedans for most makes ( except chrysler products ) recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis .
the cadillac deville and fleetwood , buick electra , oldsmobile 98 , lincoln continental , mercury marquis , and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s .
the only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the chevrolet bel air , and ford galaxie 500. slightly smaller , mid-size models such as the oldsmobile cutlass , chevrolet monte carlo , ford thunderbird and various other models sold well .
by 1979 , virtually all " full-size " american cars had shrunk , featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions .
chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year , moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 ( except for the m-body dodge diplomat/plymouth gran fury and chrysler new yorker fifth avenue sedans ) .
federal safety standards , such as nhtsa federal motor vehicle safety standard 215 ( pertaining to safety bumpers ) , and compacts like the 1974 mustang i were a prelude to the dot " downsize " revision of vehicle categories .
opec soon lost its preeminent position , and in 1981 , its production was surpassed by that of other countries .
the world price , which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $ 40 per barrel , decreased during the 1980s to less than $ 10 per barrel .
saudi arabia , trying to recover market share , increased production , pushing prices down , shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers .
the world price , which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $ 40 per barrel , decreased during the 1980s to less than $ 10 per barrel .
the apollo program , also known as project apollo , was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , which accomplished landing the first humans on the moon from 1969 to 1972. first conceived during dwight d. eisenhower 's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man project mercury which put the first americans in space , apollo was later dedicated to president john f. kennedy 's national goal of " landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth " by the end of the 1960s , which he proposed in a may 25 , 1961 , address to congress .

project mercury was followed by the two-man project gemini ( 1962–66 ) .
apollo ran from 1961 to 1972 , and was supported by the two-man gemini program which ran concurrently with it from 1962 to 1966. gemini missions developed some of the space travel techniques that were necessary for the success of the apollo missions .

budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these .
five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings , but the apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon , which disabled the command spacecraft 's propulsion and life support .

apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body , while the final apollo 17 mission marked the sixth moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low earth orbit .
the program returned 842 pounds ( 382 kg ) of lunar rocks and soil to earth , greatly contributing to the understanding of the moon 's composition and geological history .
apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight , including avionics , telecommunications , and computers .
while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission , apollo would carry three astronauts .
while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission , apollo would carry three astronauts .
the program was named after the greek god of light , music , and the sun by nasa manager abe silverstein , who later said that " i was naming the spacecraft like i 'd name my baby . "
possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station , circumlunar flights , and eventual manned lunar landings .
the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early 1960 , as a follow-up to project mercury .
in july 1960 , nasa deputy administrator hugh l. dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences .
meanwhile , nasa performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget , to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs .
on august 30 , a feasibility study competition was announced , and on october 25 , three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics/convair , general electric , and the glenn l. martin company .

in november 1960 , john f. kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense .
he knew little about the technical details of the space program , and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing .
when kennedy 's newly appointed nasa administrator james e. webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency , kennedy supported an acceleration of nasa 's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue .
up to the election of 1960 , kennedy had been speaking out against the " missile gap " that he and many other senators felt had formed between the soviets and themselves due to the inaction of president eisenhower .
on april 12 , 1961 , soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space , reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union .

at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarin 's flight , many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up .
kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news , refusing to make a commitment on america 's response to the soviets .
on april 20 , kennedy sent a memo to vice president lyndon b. johnson , asking johnson to look into the status of america 's space program , and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up .

but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission , so land acquisition was started in july 1961 for a launch operations center ( loc ) immediately north of canaveral at merritt island .
the design , development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h. debus , a member of dr. wernher von braun 's original v-2 rocket engineering team .
debus was named the loc 's first director .
construction began in november 1962. upon kennedy 's death , president johnson issued an executive order on november 29 , 1963 , to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy .
although at least three pads were planned , only two , designated a and b , were completed in october 1965. the loc also included an operations and checkout building ( ocb ) to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles .
the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250,000 feet ( 76 km ) , which is nearly a vacuum .

the loc included launch complex 39 , a launch control center , and a 130 million cubic foot ( 3.7 million cubic meter ) vertical assembly building ( vab ) in which the space vehicle ( launch vehicle and spacecraft ) would be assembled on a mobile launcher platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads .
administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control , he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization , so he recruited dr. george e. mueller for a high management job .
on july 23 , 1963 , webb announced mueller 's appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight , to replace then associate administrator d. brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september 1. under webb 's reorganization , the directors of the manned spacecraft center ( gilruth ) marshall space flight center ( von braun ) and the launch operations center ( debus ) effectively reported to mueller .

based on his industry experience on air force missile projects , mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in the united states air force , so he got webb 's permission to recruit general samuel c. phillips , who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program , as omsf program controller .

mueller agreed , and phillips managed apollo from january 1964 , until it achieved the first manned landing in july 1969 , after which he returned to air force duty .
phillips ' superior officer bernard a. schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa , along with a staff of officers under him , on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director .
many engineers feared that a rendezvous —let alone a docking— neither of which had been attempted even in earth orbit , would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit .
in early 1961 , direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa .
bypassing the nasa hierarchy , he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans ; while acknowledging that he spoke " somewhat as a voice in the wilderness , " houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question .
seamans ' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e. golovin in july 1961 , to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program , represented a turning point in nasa 's mission mode decision .

in late 1961 and early 1962 , members of the manned spacecraft center began to come around to support lor , including the newly hired deputy director of the office of manned space flight , joseph shea , who became a champion of lor .

the engineers at marshall space flight center ( msfc ) took longer to become convinced of its merits , but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing in june 1962 .
kennedy 's science advisor jerome wiesner , who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office , and had opposed the decision to land men on the moon , hired golovin , who had left nasa , to chair his own " space vehicle panel " , ostensibly to monitor , but actually to second-guess nasa 's decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea , seamans , and even webb to defend themselves , delaying its formal announcement to the press on july 11 , 1962 , and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as " tentative " .

wiesner kept up the pressure , even making the disagreement public during a two-day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center .
wiesner blurted out " no , that 's no good " in front of the press , during a presentation by von braun .
webb held firm , and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module ( lem ) contractors .
nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november 1962 .
the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a " lifeboat " in the event of a failure of the command ship .
ironically , just such a failure happened on apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power .
the lunar module provided propulsion , electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely .
a 1964 msc study concluded , " the lm [ as lifeboat ] ... was finally dropped , because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps . "
maxime faget 's preliminary apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module , supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power , sized appropriately for the space station , cislunar , and lunar landing missions .
once kennedy 's moon landing goal became official , detailed design began of a command/service module ( csm ) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip , after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module .
the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csm 's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew , along with a new spacecraft , the lunar excursion module ( lem , later shortened to lunar module , lm ) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the csm .
the command module ( cm ) was the conical crew cabin , designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing .
the command module ( cm ) was the conical crew cabin , designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing .
its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield , and had its own reaction control system ( rcs ) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path .
parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown .
the module was 11.42 feet ( 3.48 m ) tall , 12.83 feet ( 3.91 m ) in diameter , and weighed approximately 12,250 pounds ( 5,560 kg ) .
a cylindrical service module ( sm ) supported the command module , with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants , and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants .
a high-gain s-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights .
the service module was discarded just before re-entry .
the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51,300 pounds ( 23,300 kg ) fully fueled , while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54,000 pounds ( 24,000 kg ) .
on the extended lunar missions , an orbital scientific instrument package was carried .
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm , and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa .
because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous , the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off of the moon , and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight .
a 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing , while block ii , the actual lunar spacecraft , would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development .
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm , and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa .
the lunar module ( lm ) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module .
not designed to fly through the earth 's atmosphere or return to earth , its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations , and was of an extremely lightweight construction .
the initial lm model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds ( 15,100 kg ) , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours .
an extended lunar module weighed over 36,200 pounds ( 16,400 kg ) , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days .
before the apollo program began , wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles , the saturn series , and the even larger nova series .
in the midst of these plans , von braun was transferred from the army to nasa , and made director of the marshall space flight center .
the june 11 , 1962 , decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova , and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo .
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc-34 , with only live first stages , carrying dummy upper stages filled with water .
this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms ( designated as-101 through as-105 ) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites , which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts .

the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i. the s-ib first stage increased the thrust to 1,600,000 pounds-force ( 7,120 kn ) , and the second stage replaced the s-iv with the s-ivb-200 , powered by a single j-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox , to produce 200,000 lbf ( 890 kn ) of thrust .

a restartable version of the s-ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v. the saturn ib could send over 40,000 pounds ( 18,100 kg ) into low earth orbit , sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm .

the three-stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon .
it was 33 feet ( 10.1 m ) in diameter and stood 363 feet ( 110.6 m ) tall with its 96,800-pound ( 43,900 kg ) lunar payload .
the three-stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon .
the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen , and the third stage was a modified version of the s-ivb , with thrust increased to 230,000 lbf ( 1,020 kn ) and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit .
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans , plus from two later astronaut groups .
all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans .
dr. harrison schmitt , a geologist , was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space , and landed on the moon on the last mission , apollo 17. schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the apollo landing crews .

the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom , white , and chaffee in 1969 , then to the crews of all missions from apollo 8 onward .
the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo 7 , walter m. schirra , donn eisele , and walter cunningham , were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal , because of discipline problems with the flight director 's orders during their flight .
the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom , white , and chaffee in 1969 , then to the crews of all missions from apollo 8 onward .
two block i csms were launched from lc-34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the saturn ib .
the first , as-201 launched on february 26 , reached an altitude of 265.7 nautical miles ( 492.1 km ) and splashed down 4,577 nautical miles ( 8,477 km ) downrange in the atlantic ocean .
the second , as-202 on august 25 , reached 617.1 nautical miles ( 1,142.9 km ) altitude and was recovered 13,900 nautical miles ( 25,700 km ) downrange in the pacific ocean .
these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield .
after an unmanned lm test flight as-206 , a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as-207/208 , or as-278 ( each spacecraft would be launched on a separate saturn ib . )
the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo spacesuit , designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity ( eva ) .
the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear " fishbowl " type for greater visibility , and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water-cooled undergarment .

mercury/gemini veteran wally schirra , eisele , and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september 29 as the prime crew for as-205 .
in december 1966 , the as-205 mission was canceled , since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight , and as-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft .
its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission , now redesignated as-205/208 or as-258 , planned for august 1967. mcdivitt , scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as-258 crew , and schirra , eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo 1 backup crew .

the problems with north american were severe enough in late 1965 to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a " tiger team " to investigate north american 's problems and identify corrections .

meanwhile , grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module , eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967 , not long after the first manned csm flights .

they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american , and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center .
grissom , white , and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight .
a " plugs-out " test was planned for january , which would simulate a launch countdown on lc-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power .
they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american , and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center .
first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits , which delayed the sealing of the hatch .
the plugs-out test began on the morning of january 27 , 1967 , and immediately was plagued with problems .
during this hold , an electrical fire began in the cabin , and spread quickly in the high pressure , 100 % oxygen atmosphere .
the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened .
during this hold , an electrical fire began in the cabin , and spread quickly in the high pressure , 100 % oxygen atmosphere .
nasa immediately convened an accident review board , overseen by both houses of congress .
while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex , the review board concluded that " deficiencies existed in command module design , workmanship and quality control . "
webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office ( aspo ) manager joseph francis shea , replacing him with george low .
nasa immediately convened an accident review board , overseen by both houses of congress .
to remedy the causes of the fire , changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures , the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch , and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials .
to remedy the causes of the fire , changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures , the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch , and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials .
the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release , outward opening door .
nasa discontinued the manned block i program , using the block i spacecraft only for unmanned saturn v flights .
crew members would also exclusively wear modified , fire-resistant block ii space suits , and would be designated by the block ii titles , regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not .
in september 1967 , mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing .
each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed , and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary ; therefore letters were used instead of numbers .

the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on man-rating the lm and saturn v. apollo 4 ( as-501 ) was the first unmanned flight of the saturn v , carrying a block i csm on november 9 , 1967. the capability of the command module 's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth-orbital reentry speed .

this was followed on april 4 , 1968 , by apollo 6 ( as-502 ) which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast .
mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo 4. based on the good performance of apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo 6 problems , nasa declared the saturn v ready to fly men , cancelling a third unmanned test .
apollo 5 ( as-204 ) was the first unmanned test flight of lm in earth orbit , launched from pad 37 on january 22 , 1968 , by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo 1. the lm engines were successfully test-fired and restarted , despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing .

the ascent engine was fired in abort mode , known as a " fire-in-the-hole " test , where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage .
apollo 8 was planned to be the d mission in december 1968 , crewed by mcdivitt , scott and schweickart , launched on a saturn v instead of two saturn ibs .
the soviet union had sent animals around the moon on september 15 , 1968 , aboard zond 5 , and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts .
the decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of apollo 7. gemini veterans frank borman and james lovell , and rookie william anders captured the world 's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours , transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve , and returning safely to earth .
rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth-orbiting mission , aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo 8 to orbit the moon instead , deferring the d mission to the next mission in march 1969 , and eliminating the e mission .

the astronauts returned safely on july 24 .
in november 1969 , gemini veteran charles " pete " conrad and rookie alan l. bean made a precision landing on apollo 12 within walking distance of the surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe , which had landed in april 1967 on the ocean of storms .
in november 1969 , gemini veteran charles " pete " conrad and rookie alan l. bean made a precision landing on apollo 12 within walking distance of the surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe , which had landed in april 1967 on the ocean of storms .
on one , they walked to the surveyor , photographed it , and removed some parts which they returned to earth .
the command module pilot was gemini veteran richard f. gordon , jr. conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera , but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun .
these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle ( lrv ) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm .
also , the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv .
the contracted batch of 15 saturn vs were enough for lunar landing missions through apollo 20. nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites , with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions , along with the payload capacity of the saturn v. these final missions would combine the i and j types in the 1967 list , allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface , and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days .

but two days out , a liquid oxygen tank exploded , disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a " life boat " to return to earth .
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander , with two rookies .
apollo was grounded again , for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added .

apollo 13 launched lovell , jack swigert , and fred haise in april 1970 , headed for the fra mauro formation .
about the time of the first landing in 1969 , it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground , replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches ; this eliminated apollo 20. nasa 's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing , and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle .

by 1971 , the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f. kennedy space center on merritt island , florida , george c. marshall space center in huntsville , alabama , michoud assembly facility in new orleans , louisiana , and lyndon b. johnson space center in houston , texas .

the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth , as measured by radiometric dating techniques .
they range in age from about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria , to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust .
a geochemical component called kreep was discovered , which has no known terrestrial counterpart .
one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock , retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo 15 mission .
many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters , which is never seen on earth rocks , due to the thick atmosphere .
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects .
some of the returned samples are of impact melt ( materials melted near an impact crater . )
in 2009 , nasa held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $ 170 billion .
this included all research and development costs ; the procurement of 15 saturn v rockets , 16 command/service modules , 12 lunar modules , plus program support and management costs ; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading , and costs for flight operations .
this was based on a congressional budget office report , a budgetary analysis of nasa 's new vision for space , september 2004. the space review estimated in 2010 the cost of apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $ 20.4 billion , or $ 109 billion in 2010 dollars .
the apollo extension series ( apollo x , ) proposed up to 30 flights to earth orbit , using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter ( sla ) to house a small orbital laboratory ( workshop ) .
this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s-ivb saturn upper stage , and grew into the apollo applications program ( aap ) .
the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s-ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly-by mission .
dubbed skylab , it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space , and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a saturn v. it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount , the solar telescope that would have been used on the apollo telescope missions .

skylab 's last crew departed the station on february 8 , 1974 , and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979 , by which time it had become the oldest operational apollo-saturn component .

in 2009 , nasa 's robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter , while orbiting 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) above the moon , began photographing the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface , and photographed each site where manned apollo flights landed .
all of the u. s. flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing , with the exception of the one left during the apollo 11 mission , which was blown over during that mission 's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit ; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown .

the crew of apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth , and read from the creation story in the book of genesis , on christmas eve , 1968. an estimated one-quarter of the population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon .

the mission and christmas provided an inspiring end to 1968 , which had been a troubled year for the us , marked by vietnam war protests , race riots , and the assassinations of civil rights leader martin luther king , jr. , and senator robert f. kennedy .
the moon landing data was recorded by a special apollo tv camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast tv .

during the following years , a magnetic tape shortage prompted nasa to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the national archives and records administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data .

stan lebar , who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at westinghouse electric corporation , also worked with nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes .
with a budget of $ 230,000 , the surviving original lunar broadcast data from apollo 11 was compiled by nafzger and assigned to lowry digital for restoration .
the video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy .
the images were from tapes in australia , the cbs news archive , and kinescope recordings made at johnson space center .
with a budget of $ 230,000 , the surviving original lunar broadcast data from apollo 11 was compiled by nafzger and assigned to lowry digital for restoration .
the restored video , remaining in black and white , contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements .
the three sources of european union law are primary law , secondary law and supplementary law .
european union law is a body of treaties and legislation , such as regulations and directives , which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of european union member states .
the main sources of primary law are the treaties establishing the european union .
secondary sources include regulations and directives which are based on the treaties .
the legislature of the european union is principally composed of the european parliament and the council of the european union , which under the treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the treaties .

the eu 's primary constitutional sources are the treaty on european union ( teu ) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) , which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states .
the european commission has the initiative to propose legislation .
during the ordinary legislative procedure , the council ( which are ministers from member state governments ) and the european parliament ( elected by citizens ) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass .
the european court of justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets eu law , and develops it through precedent .
the " european council " ( rather than the council , made up of different government ministers ) is composed of the prime ministers or executive presidents of the member states .
the primary law of the eu consists mainly of the founding treaties , the " core " treaties being the treaty on european union ( teu ) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) .
the teu specifically excludes certain regions , for example the faroe islands , from the jurisdiction of european union law .
the court of justice of the european union can interpret the treaties , but it can not rule on their validity , which is subject to international law .
individuals may rely on primary law in the court of justice of the european union if the treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear , precise and unconditional .
treaties apply as soon as they enter into force , unless stated otherwise , and are generally concluded for an unlimited period .

the principal treaties that form the european union began with common rules for coal and steel , and then atomic energy , but more complete and formal institutions were established through the treaty of rome 1957 and the maastricht treaty 1992 ( now : tfeu ) .

following the nice treaty , there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the european union and make it more transparent ; this would have also produced a single constitutional document .
however , as a result of the referendum in france and the referendum in the netherlands , the 2004 treaty establishing a constitution for europe never came into force .
its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty , but it was formally an amending treaty , and – though it significantly altered the existing treaties – it did not completely replace them .

the european commission is the main executive body of the european union .
this means that the commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure , although the council is the " de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives " .
the commission 's president ( currently an ex-luxembourg prime minister , jean-claude juncker ) sets the agenda for the eu 's work .
[ citation needed ] since ireland refused to consent to changes in the treaty of lisbon 2007 , there remains one commissioner for each of the 28 member states , including the president and the high representative for foreign and security policy ( currently federica mogherini ) .

article 17 ( 1 ) of the treaty on european union states the commission should " promote the general interest of the union " while article 17 ( 3 ) adds that commissioners should be " completely independent " and not " take instructions from any government " .
the commission 's president ( currently an ex-luxembourg prime minister , jean-claude juncker ) sets the agenda for the eu 's work .
decisions are taken by a simple majority vote , usually through a " written procedure " of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections .

this means commissioners are , through the appointment process , the unelected subordinates of member state governments .
commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the santer commission was censured by parliament in 1999 , and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations .
this resulted in one main case , commission v edith cresson where the european court of justice held that a commissioner giving her dentist a job , for which he was clearly unqualified , did in fact not break any law .
by contrast to the ecj 's relaxed approach , a committee of independent experts found that a culture had developed where few commissioners had ‘ even the slightest sense of responsibility ’ .
it has a six-person board appointed by the european council , on the council 's recommendation .
the president of the council and a commissioner can sit in on ecb meetings , but do not have voting rights .

this led to the creation of the european anti-fraud office .
in 2012 it investigated the maltese commissioner for health , john dalli , who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a tobacco products directive .
while the commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation , the european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process .
in practice , equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the parliament can not initiate legislation against the commission 's wishes , citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in parliament as citizens of the largest countries , and " qualified majorities " or consensus of the council are required to legislate .
parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote .
it can require the commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole commission ( as happened to the santer commission in 1999 ) .
however its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the commission and council , meaning power ( " kratia " ) is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ( " demos " ) : in the eu it is not yet true that " the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few . "

while the commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation , the european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process .
over time , this has meant the parliament gradually assumed more voice : from being an unelected assembly , to its first direct elections in 1979 , to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process .
parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote .
meps divide , as they do in national parliaments , along political party lines : the conservative european people 's party is currently the largest , and the party of european socialists leads the opposition .
the second main legislative body is the council , which is composed of different ministers of the member states .
it meets each six months and its president ( currently former poland prime minister donald tusk ) is meant to 'drive forward its work ' , but it does not itself 'legislative functions ' .
when voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size , so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states .
in total there are 352 votes , but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote , if not consensus .
teu article 16 ( 4 ) and tfeu article 238 ( 3 ) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the council members ( not votes ) representing 65 per cent of the population of the eu : currently this means around 74 per cent , or 260 of the 352 votes .

the essence is there are three readings , starting with a commission proposal , where the parliament must vote by a majority of all meps ( not just those present ) to block or suggest changes , and the council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes , but by unanimity to block commission amendment .

this means , legislation can be blocked by a majority in parliament , a minority in the council , and a majority in the commission : it is harder to change eu law than stay the same .
teu articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred , although there is a debate about the kompetenz-kompetenz question : who ultimately has the " competence " to define the eu 's " competence " .
many member state courts believe they decide , other member state parliaments believe they decide , while within the eu , the court of justice believes it has the final say .
to make new legislation , tfeu article 294 defines the " ordinary legislative procedure " that applies for most eu acts .

where the different institutions can not agree at any stage , a " conciliation committee " is convened , representing meps , ministers and the commission to try and get agreement on a joint text : if this works , it will be sent back to the parliament and council to approve by absolute and qualified majority .
the judicial branch of the eu has played an important role in the development of eu law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration .
today the court of justice of the european union ( cjeu ) is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher european court of justice ( commonly abbreviated as ecj ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a general court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance .
under the treaty on european union article 19 ( 2 ) there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to " possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices " ( or for the general court , the " ability required for appointment to high judicial office " ) .
in fact , most eu law is applied by member state courts ( the english court of appeal , the german bundesgerichtshof , the belgian cour du travail , etc . )
the cjeu 's duty is to " ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed " , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate .

within the eu itself , the court of justice 's view is that if eu law conflicts with a provision of national law , then eu law has primacy .
he claimed the italian nationalisation law conflicted with the treaty of rome , and requested a reference be made to both the italian constitutional court and the court of justice under tfeu article 267. the italian constitutional court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , costa had no claim .
similarly , in amministrazione delle finanze v simmenthal spa , a company , simmenthal spa , claimed that a public health inspection fee under an italian law of 1970 for importing beef from france to italy was contrary to two regulations from 1964 and 1968. in " accordance with the principle of the precedence of community law , " said the court of justice , the " directly applicable measures of the institutions " ( such as the regulations in the case ) " render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law " .
this has meant both the european court of justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems .
in the first major case in 1964 , costa v enel , a milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named mr costa refused to pay his electricity bill to enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the italian energy corporations .
by contrast , the court of justice held that ultimately the treaty of rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the treaty provisions only the commission could have brought a claim , not mr costa .
generally speaking , while all member states recognise that eu law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the treaties , they do not accept that the court of justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights .

more recently the uk supreme court noted that in r ( hs2 action alliance ltd ) v secretary of state for transport , although the uk constitution is uncodified , there could be " fundamental principles " of common law , and parliament " did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation " of those principles when it enacted the european communities act 1972. the view of the german constitutional court from the solange i and solange ii decisions is that if the eu does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles ( particularly democracy , the rule of law and the social state principles ) then it can not override german law .
this suggests the eu 's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states , its factual commitment to human rights , and the democratic will of the people .

however , under directives , citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties .
all actions by eu institutions can be subject to judicial review , and judged by standards of proportionality , particularly where general principles of law , or fundamental rights are engaged .
while constitutional law concerns the european union 's governance structure , administrative law binds eu institutions and member states to follow the law .
in van gend en loos v nederlandse administratie der belastingen it was held that the provisions of the treaties ( and eu regulations ) are directly effective , if they are ( 1 ) clear and unambiguous ( 2 ) unconditional , and ( 3 ) did not require eu or national authorities to take further action to implement them .
because article 30 clearly , unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade , without a good justification , van gend en loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff .
van gend en loos , a postal company , claimed that what is now tfeu article 30 prevented the dutch customs authorities charging tariffs , when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from germany to the netherlands .
eu regulations are the same as treaty provisions in this sense , because as tfeu article 288 states , they are ‘ directly applicable in all member states ’ .
while the treaties and regulations will have direct effect ( if clear , unconditional and immediate ) , directives do not generally give citizens ( as opposed to the member state ) standing to sue other citizens .
for example , the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , but most member states require more than 28 days in national law .
for example , the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , but most member states require more than 28 days in national law .
this view was instantly controversial , and in the early 1990s three advocate generals persuasively argued that directives should create rights and duties for all citizens .
first , if a directive 's deadline for implementation is not met , the member state can not enforce conflicting laws , and a citizen may rely on the directive in such an action ( so called " vertical " direct effect ) .
second , a citizen or company can invoke a directive , not just in a dispute with a public authority , but in a dispute with another citizen or company .
ms kücükdeveci worked for 10 years , from age 18 to 28 , for swedex gmbh & co kg before her dismissal .
in foster v british gas plc the court of justice held that mrs foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer , british gas plc , which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65 , if ( 1 ) pursuant to a state measure , ( 2 ) it provided a public service , and ( 3 ) had special powers .

fourth , national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law " as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive " .
in marleasing sa v la comercial sa the court of justice held that a spanish court had to interpret its general civil code provisions , on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors , to conform with the first company law directive article 11 , that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons .
so , in francovich v italy , the italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent , as the insolvency protection directive required .
francovich , the former employee of a bankrupt venetian firm , was therefore allowed to claim 6 million lira from the italian government in damages for his loss .
the principles of european union law are rules of law which have been developed by the european court of justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how european union law is interpreted and applies .
accepted general principles of european union law include fundamental rights ( see human rights ) , proportionality , legal certainty , equality before the law and subsidiarity .
proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1950s .
the principle of proportionality is also recognised in article 5 of the ec treaty , stating that " any action by the community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this treaty " .
when there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted , and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued .
the concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1960s .
it is an important general principle of international law and public law , which predates european union law .
the adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the european union must have a proper legal basis .
the doctrine of legitimate expectation , which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith , is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in european union law .
as such the european court of justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states .
therefore , the european court of justice can not uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states .
none of the original treaties establishing the european union mention protection for fundamental rights .
at the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights , hence the establishment of the european convention on human rights in 1950 and the establishment of the european court of human rights .

in 1999 the european council set up a body tasked with drafting a european charter of human rights , which could form the constitutional basis for the european union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the european union and its institutions .
the 2007 lisbon treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in article 6 ( 1 ) that " the union recognises the rights , freedoms and principles set out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union of 7 december 2000 , as adopted at strasbourg on 12 december 2007 , which shall have the same legal value as the treaties . "
therefore , the charter of fundamental rights of the european union has become an integral part of european union law , codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of european union law .
in effect , after the lisbon treaty , the charter and the convention now co-exist under european union law , though the former is enforced by the european court of justice in relation to european union measures , and the latter by the european court of human rights in relation to measures by member states .

the social chapter is a chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam covering social policy issues in european union law .
the social chapter is a chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam covering social policy issues in european union law .
the basis for the social chapter was developed in 1989 by the " social partners " representatives , namely unice , the employers ' confederation , the european trade union confederation ( etuc ) and ceep , the european centre of public enterprises .
the social charter declares 30 general principles , including on fair remuneration of employment , health and safety at work , rights of disabled and elderly , the rights of workers , on vocational training and improvements of living conditions .
the social charter became the basis for european community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation .
the social charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states .
the uk refused to sign the social charter and was exempt from the legislation covering social charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation .
the uk subsequently was the only member state to veto the social charter being included as the " social chapter " of the 1992 maastricht treaty - instead , an agreement on social policy was added as a protocol .

eu competition law has its origins in the european coal and steel community ( ecsc ) agreement between france , italy , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and germany in 1951 following the second world war .
eu competition law has its origins in the european coal and steel community ( ecsc ) agreement between france , italy , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and germany in 1951 following the second world war .
article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations , or mergers , and the abuse of a dominant position by companies .
article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations , or mergers , and the abuse of a dominant position by companies .
in 1957 competition rules were included in the treaty of rome , also known as the ec treaty , which established the european economic community ( eec ) .
today , the treaty of lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in article 101 ( 1 ) , including price fixing .
article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position , such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing .
articles 106 and 107 provide that member state 's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed , but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies .
article 102 allows the european council to regulations to govern mergers between firms ( the current regulation is the regulation 139/2004/ec ) .
while the concept of a " social market economy " was only introduced into eu law in 2007 , free movement and trade were central to european development since the treaty of rome 1957. according to the standard theory of comparative advantage , two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects .

like in other regional organisations such as the north american free trade association , or the world trade organisation , breaking down barriers to trade , and enhancing free movement of goods , services , labour and capital , is meant to reduce consumer prices .
the treaties limit free trade , to prioritise other values such as public health , consumer protection , labour rights , fair competition , and environmental improvement .
increasingly the court of justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people 's well being .
free movement of goods within the european union is achieved by a customs union , and the principle of non-discrimination .
it discriminated against parallel importers like mr dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in france , where they bought the scotch .
it also means states can be responsible for private actors .
for instance , in commission v france french farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of spanish strawberries , and even belgian tomato imports .
so , in schmidberger v austria the court of justice held that austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the a13 , brenner autobahn , en route to italy .
in the most famous case rewe-zentral ag v bundesmonopol für branntwein , the court of justice found that a german law requiring all spirits and liqueurs ( not just imported ones ) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to tfeu article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports .
german liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but cassis de dijon , which rewe-zentrale ag wished to import from france , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol .
in a 2003 case , commission v italy italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as " chocolate " .
all italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone , but british , danish and irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats .
if member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product , this can also infringe article 34. so , in a 2009 case , commission v italy , the court of justice held that an italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. again , the law applied neutrally to everyone , but disproportionately affected importers , because italian companies did not make trailers .
in keck and mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a french competition law , which prevented them selling picon beer under wholesale price , was unlawful .
the aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition , not to hinder trade .
in konsumentombudsmannen v de agostini the court of justice reviewed swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12 , and misleading commercials for skin care products .
under the unfair commercial practices directive , the eu harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising , to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour , is misleading or aggressive , and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair .
since its foundation , the treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement .
reflecting the economic nature of the project , the european community originally focused upon free movement of workers : as a " factor of production " .
free movement was increasingly based on " citizenship " , so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active , rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights .
for example , in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie , a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands , while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the bhagwan community , which provided for everyone 's material needs irrespective of their contributions .
the court of justice held that mr steymann was entitled to stay , so long as there was at least an " indirect quid pro quo " for the work he did .
the free movement of workers regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers .
in a famous case , the belgian football association v bosman , a belgian footballer named jean-marc bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from r.f.c .
in groener v minister for education the court of justice accepted that a requirement to speak gaelic to teach in a dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the irish language , but only if the measure was not disproportionate .
in hendrix v employee insurance institute the court of justice held that a dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to belgium , because the benefit was " closely linked to the socio-economic situation " of the netherlands .
conversely , in geven v land nordrhein-westfalen the court of justice held that a dutch woman living in the netherlands , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in germany , did not have a right to receive german child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in germany but was resident in austria could .
citizenship of the eu has increasingly been seen as a " fundamental " status of member state nationals by the court of justice , and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move .
citizenship of the eu has increasingly been seen as a " fundamental " status of member state nationals by the court of justice , and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move .
in commission v austria the court held that austria was not entitled to restrict places in austrian universities to austrian students to avoid " structural , staffing and financial problems " if ( mainly german ) foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem .
the court has required that higher education , along with other forms of vocational training , should be more access , albeit with qualifying periods .
as well as creating rights for " workers " who generally lack bargaining power in the market , the treaty on the functioning of the european union also protects the " freedom of establishment " in article 49 , and " freedom to provide services " in article 56. in gebhard v consiglio dell ’ ordine degli avvocati e procuratori di milano the court of justice held that to be " established " means to participate in economic life " on a stable and continuous basis " , while providing " services " meant pursuing activity more " on a temporary basis " .
however , the requirements to be registered in milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory , " justified by imperative requirements in the general interest " and proportionately applied .
in reyners v belgium the court of justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the belgian bar because he lacked belgian nationality was unjustified .
tfeu article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others ' freedom of establishment when they exercise " official authority " , but this did an advocate 's work ( as opposed to a court 's ) was not official .
by contrast in commission v italy the court of justice held that a requirement for lawyers in italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction .
in 2006 , a toxic waste spill off the coast of côte d'ivoire , from a european ship , prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste .
with countries such as spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste , franco frattini , the justice , freedom and security commissioner , proposed with dimas to create criminal sentences for " ecological crimes " .
however , in october 2007 , the court of justice ruled that the commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be , only that there must be some .
the competence for the union to do this was contested in 2005 at the court of justice resulting in a victory for the commission .
the " freedom to provide services " under tfeu article 56 applies to people who give services " for remuneration " , especially commercial or professional activity .
for example , in van binsbergen v bestuur van de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice .
the court of justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction .
the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom ( of the german health clinic ) to provide services .
in regard to companies , the court of justice held in r ( daily mail and general trust plc ) v hm treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business , without infringing tfeu article 49. this meant the daily mail newspaper 's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the uk .
uk law only required £1 of capital to start a company , while denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 danish krone ( around €27,000 ) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent .
uk law only required £1 of capital to start a company , while denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 danish krone ( around €27,000 ) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent .
although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work , or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far : it was an " outright negation " of the right of establishment .
similarly in überseering bv v nordic construction gmbh the court of justice held that a german court could not deny a dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in germany .
the amazon rainforest ( portuguese : floresta amazônica or amazônia ; spanish : selva amazónica , amazonía or usually amazonia ; french : forêt amazonienne ; dutch : amazoneregenwoud ) , also known in english as amazonia or the amazon jungle , is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the amazon basin of south america .
this basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres ( 2,700,000 sq mi ) , of which 5,500,000 square kilometres ( 2,100,000 sq mi ) are covered by the rainforest .
this region includes territory belonging to nine nations .
states or departments in four nations contain " amazonas " in their names .
the amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests , and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world , with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species .

following the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent .
climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics .
during the oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band .
it expanded again during the middle miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum .
however , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species .
following the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent .
from 66–34 mya , the rainforest extended as far south as 45° .

during the mid-eocene , it is believed that the drainage basin of the amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the purus arch .
water on the eastern side flowed toward the atlantic , while to the west water flowed toward the pacific across the amazonas basin .
as the andes mountains rose , however , a large basin was created that enclosed a lake ; now known as the solimões basin .
within the last 5–10 million years , this accumulating water broke through the purus arch , joining the easterly flow toward the atlantic .

there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) and subsequent deglaciation .
analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin .
some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today .
this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data .

archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea , as described in her book amazonia : man and culture in a counterfeit paradise .
she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 0.52/sq mi ) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population .
she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 0.52/sq mi ) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population .
however , recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated .
some 5 million people may have lived in the amazon region in ad 1500 , divided between dense coastal settlements , such as that at marajó , and inland dwellers .
for a long time , it was thought that the amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil .

the bbc 's unnatural histories presented evidence that the amazon rainforest , rather than being a pristine wilderness , has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta .
terra preta ( black earth ) , which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management .
terra preta ( black earth ) , which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management .
the development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment ; meaning that large portions of the amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management , rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed .
in the region of the xingu tribe , remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the amazon forest were found in 2003 by michael heckenberger and colleagues of the university of florida .

deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas .
prior to the early 1960s , access to the forest 's interior was highly restricted , and the forest remained basically intact .
farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method .
however , the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion .
deforestation is considerable , and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space .
between 1991 and 2000 , the total area of forest lost in the amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres ( 160,000 to 227,000 sq mi ) , with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle .

currently , brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the united states .
seventy percent of formerly forested land in the amazon , and 91 % of land deforested since 1970 , is used for livestock pasture .
the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon .
the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation .
the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 ( 22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year ) was 18 % higher than in the previous five years ( 19,018 km2 or 7,343 sq mi per year ) .

the researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) and thematic mapper ( tm ) to accurately place the different portions of the amazon into one of the four classifications .
in 2005 , parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years , and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought .
scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response , coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate , are pushing the rainforest towards a " tipping point " where it would irreversibly start to die .

fertilization is generally external , although platyctenids ' eggs are fertilized inside their parents ' bodies and kept there until they hatch .
the combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate .
most species are hermaphrodites—a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm , meaning it can fertilize its own egg , not needing a mate .

others are sequential hermaphrodites , in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times .
fertilization is generally external , although platyctenids ' eggs are fertilized inside their parents ' bodies and kept there until they hatch .
the exceptions are the beroids , whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles , and the platyctenids , whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size , but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form .
one ctenophore , mnemiopsis , has accidentally been introduced into the black sea , where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish .
one ctenophore , mnemiopsis , has accidentally been introduced into the black sea , where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish .
the situation was aggravated by other factors , such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the mnemiopsis population .
the later accidental introduction of beroe helped to mitigate the problem , as beroe preys on other ctenophores .

a recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like , and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently , probably after the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago .
evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the " cydippids " are not monophyletic , in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor , because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids .
despite their soft , gelatinous bodies , fossils thought to represent ctenophores , apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms , have been found in lagerstätten as far back as the early cambrian , about 515 million years ago .

ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges , about as complex as cnidarians ( jellyfish , sea anemones , etc .
ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts , which are sticky and adhere to prey , although a few ctenophore species lack them .
) , and less complex than bilaterians ( which include almost all other animals ) .

) , and less complex than bilaterians ( which include almost all other animals ) .
like sponges and cnidarians , ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material , which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores ; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer .
hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic , along with sponges .

ranging from about 1 millimeter ( 0.039 in ) to 1.5 meters ( 4.9 ft ) in size , ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia ( " hairs " ) as their main method of locomotion .
ranging from about 1 millimeter ( 0.039 in ) to 1.5 meters ( 4.9 ft ) in size , ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia ( " hairs " ) as their main method of locomotion .
most species have eight strips , called comb rows , that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia , called " ctenes , " stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat , those of each comb touch the comb below .
the name " ctenophora " means " comb-bearing " , from the greek κτείς ( stem-form κτεν- ) meaning " comb " and the greek suffix -φορος meaning " carrying " .
at least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid pleurobrachia .
coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study .
coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study .
hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – pleurobrachia , beroe and mnemiopsis .
the inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium , the gastrodermis .
the nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles ( internal compartments ) , germ cells that produce eggs or sperm , and photocytes that produce bioluminescence .
the internal cavity forms : a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles ; a pharynx ( " throat " ) ; a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach ; and a system of internal canals .
the internal cavity forms : a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles ; a pharynx ( " throat " ) ; a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach ; and a system of internal canals .
these branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal : the mouth and pharynx ; the roots of the tentacles , if present ; all along the underside of each comb row ; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores .
the outer surface bears usually eight comb rows , called swimming-plates , which are used for swimming .
the " combs " ( also called " ctenes " or " comb plates " ) run across each row , and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia , up to 2 millimeters ( 0.079 in ) .
unlike conventional cilia and flagella , which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern , these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern , where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function .
hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing , unlike jellyfish .
the " combs " ( also called " ctenes " or " comb plates " ) run across each row , and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia , up to 2 millimeters ( 0.079 in ) .
it is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy , but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities .
if they enter less dense brackish water , the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density , to avoid sinking .

conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater , the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density .
the largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ ( at the opposite end from the mouth ) .

the statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long , immobile cilia .
its main component is a statocyst , a balance sensor consisting of a statolith , a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia , called " balancers " , that sense its orientation .

cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded , sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg-shaped ; the common coastal " sea gooseberry , " pleurobrachia , sometimes has an egg-shaped body with the mouth at the narrow end , although some individuals are more uniformly round .
from opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long , slender tentacles , each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn .

the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ( " little tentacles " ) , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches .
colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles ( chambers ) that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk .
the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed .
euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly ( in 40 to 60 milliseconds ) ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey .

there are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end , and are spaced evenly round the body .
from each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows , and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows .
the lobata have a pair of lobes , which are muscular , cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth .
between the lobes on either side of the mouth , many species of lobates have four auricles , gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth .

this combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey .
members of the lobate genera bathocyroe and ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes , so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly .

unlike cydippids , the movements of lobates ' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia , yet combs on the same row beat in the same mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids .

the beroida , also known as nuda , have no feeding appendages , but their large pharynx , just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body , bears " macrocilia " at the oral end .

in front of the field of macrocilia , on the mouth " lips " in some species of beroe , is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that " zip " the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding , by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip .

the cestida ( " belt animals " ) are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon .
there are two known species , with worldwide distribution in warm , and warm-temperate waters : cestum veneris ( " venus ' girdle " ) is among the largest ctenophores – up to 1.5 meters ( 4.9 ft ) long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly .
the cestida ( " belt animals " ) are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon .
cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows .
velamen parallelum , which is typically less than 20 centimeters ( 0.66 ft ) long , can move much faster in what has been described as a " darting motion " .
most platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction , with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface .
they cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular " foot " .
all but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows .
platyctenids are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current .
the gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis .
fertilization is external in most species , but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch .
self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus mnemiopsis , and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile .

in the genus beroe the juveniles , like the adults , lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths .
in some groups , such as the flat , bottom-dwelling platyctenids , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis , after dropping to the sea-floor .

when some species , including bathyctena chuni , euplokamis stationis and eurhamphaea vexilligera , are disturbed , they produce secretions ( ink ) that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies .

juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults , whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies .
almost all ctenophores are predators – there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic .
members of the genus haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts ( stinging cells ) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts .
members of the genus haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts ( stinging cells ) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts .
members of the cydippid genus pleurobrachia and the lobate bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey : pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae .
the two-tentacled " cydippid " lampea feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies , and juveniles of lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow .
ctenophores used to be regarded as " dead ends " in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals .
detailed investigation of chum salmon , oncorhynchus keta , showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps , and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around .
beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores .
this is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the red sea .
some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores , and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations .
on the other hand , in the late 1980s the western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the black sea and sea of azov via the ballast tanks of ships , and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish .

mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the mnemiopsis-eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata , and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 , which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism .

because of their soft , gelatinous bodies , ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils , and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten , places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue .
the ediacaran eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly .
three additional putative species were then found in the burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid-cambrian period .
three additional putative species were then found in the burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid-cambrian period .
all three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows , far more than the 8 typical of living species .
the early cambrian sessile frond-like fossil stromatoveris , from china 's chengjiang lagerstätte and dated to about 515 million years ago , is very similar to vendobionta of the preceding ediacaran period .

they suggested that stromatoveris was an evolutionary " aunt " of ctenophores , and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system .

several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals .
however , other researchers have argued that the placement of ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that porifera ( sponges ) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead .
since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae , it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids , having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles .
a molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 , using 26 species , including 4 recently discovered ones , confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like .
this suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished .
richard harbison 's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid .

the neighborhood of sunnyside is on fresno 's far southeast side , bounded by chestnut avenue to the west .
its major thoroughfares are kings canyon avenue and clovis avenue .
largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s , it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction .
it is also the home of the sunnyside country club , which maintains a golf course designed by william p. bell .

the popular neighborhood known as the tower district is centered around the historic tower theatre , which is included on the national list of historic places .
the theater was built in 1939 and is at olive and wishon avenues in the heart of the tower district .
( the name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower , which is actually in another nearby area ) .
to some extent , the businesses of the tower district were developed due to the proximity of the original fresno normal school , ( later renamed california state university at fresno ) .
in 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of fresno city college one-half mile north of the tower district .
[ citation needed ] after decades of neglect and suburban flight , the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the tower theatre in the late 1970s , which at that time showed second and third run movies , along with classic films .

since renewal , the tower district has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses .
today , the tower district is also known as the center of fresno 's lgbt and hipster communities .
; additionally , tower district is also known as the center of fresno 's local punk/goth/deathrock and heavy metal community .
the area is also known for its early twentieth century homes , many of which have been restored in recent decades .
the area includes many california bungalow and american craftsman style homes , spanish colonial revival style architecture , mediterranean revival style architecture , mission revival style architecture , and many storybook houses designed by fresno architects , hilliard , taylor & wheeler .
the residential architecture of the tower district contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of fresno .
the area is also known for its early twentieth century homes , many of which have been restored in recent decades .
the section of huntington boulevard between first street on the west to cedar avenue on the east is the home to many large , stately homes .
the alta vista tract , as the land would become known , was mapped by william stranahan for the pacific improvement corporation , and was officially platted in 1911. the tract 's boundaries were balch avenue on the south , cedar avenue on the east , the rear property line of platt avenue ( east of sixth street ) and platt avenue ( west of sixth street ) on the north , and first street on the west .
in 1914 developers billings & meyering acquired the tract , completed street development , provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service , and began marketing the property with fervor .
a mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes .
this rapid development was no doubt hastened by the fresno traction company right-of-way along huntington boulevard , which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the county hospital .
the " west side " of fresno , also often called " southwest fresno " , is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city .
the neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway ( which divides it from downtown fresno ) , west of the 41 freeway and south of nielsen ave ( or the newly constructed 180 freeway ) , and extends to the city limits to the west and south .
the neighborhood is traditionally considered to be the center of fresno 's african-american community .
it is culturally diverse and also includes significant mexican-american and asian-american ( principally hmong or laotian ) populations .
the " west side " of fresno , also often called " southwest fresno " , is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city .
the neighborhood includes kearney boulevard , named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire m. theo kearney , which extends from fresno street in southwest fresno about 20 mi ( 32 km ) west to kerman , california .
a small , two-lane rural road for most of its length , kearney boulevard is lined with tall palm trees .
the roughly half-mile stretch of kearney boulevard between fresno street and thorne ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for fresno 's elite african-american families .
another section , brookhaven , on the southern edge of the west side south of jensen and west of elm , was given the name by the fresno city council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood 's image .
the isolated subdivision was for years known as the " dogg pound " in reference to a local gang , and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime .
while many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before , the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the fresno housing authority .
there have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood , including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of fresno and b streets , an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood , and some new section 8 apartments have been built along church ave west of elm st. cargill meat solutions and foster farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood , and the stench from these ( and other small industrial facilities ) has long plagued area residents .

the fresno chandler executive airport is also on the west side .
the neighborhood has very little retail activity , aside from the area near fresno street and state route 99 freeway ( kearney palm shopping center , built in the late 1990s ) and small corner markets scattered throughout .
in the north eastern part of fresno , woodward park was founded by the late ralph woodward , a long-time fresno resident .
the initial 235 acres ( 0.95 km2 ) , combined with additional acres acquired later by the city , brings the park to a sizable 300 acres ( 1.2 km2 ) .
the park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people , authentic japanese garden , fenced dog park , two-mile ( 3 km ) equestrian trail , exercise par course , three children 's playgrounds , a lake , 3 small ponds , 7 picnic areas and five miles ( 8 km ) of multipurpose trails that are part of the san joaquin river parkway 's lewis s. eaton trail .
when complete , the lewis s. eaton trail system will cover 22 miles ( 35 km ) between highway 99 and friant dam .
the park is open april through october , 6am to 10pm and november through march , 6am to 7pm .

fresno is marked by a semi-arid climate ( köppen bsh ) , with mild , moist winters and hot and dry summers , thus displaying mediterranean characteristics .
july is the warmest month , averaging 83.0 °f ( 28.3 °c ) ; normally , there are 32 days of 100 °f ( 37.8 °c ) + highs and 106 days of 90 °f ( 32.2 °c ) + highs , and in july and august , there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90 °f ( 32.2 °c ) .
average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches ( 292.1 mm ) , which , by definition , would classify the area as a semidesert .
most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest , as winds are driven downward along the axis of the california central valley ; in december , january and february there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics .

fresno is served by state route 99 , the main north/south freeway that connects the major population centers of the california central valley .
state route 168 , the sierra freeway , heads east to the city of clovis and huntington lake .
state route 41 ( yosemite freeway/eisenhower freeway ) comes into fresno from atascadero in the south , and then heads north to yosemite .
state route 180 ( kings canyon freeway ) comes from the west via mendota , and from the east in kings canyon national park going towards the city of reedley .
fresno is the largest u.s. city not directly linked to an interstate highway .
when the interstate highway system was created in the 1950s , the decision was made to build what is now interstate 5 on the west side of the central valley , and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region , instead of upgrading what is now state route 99. due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along sr 99 , as well as the desirability of federal funding , much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system , most likely as interstate 9. major improvements to signage , lane width , median separation , vertical clearance , and other concerns are currently underway .

packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm , circuit switching , a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session , each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes .
in cases of billable services , such as cellular communication services , circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred , while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted , such as characters , packets , or messages .

packet mode communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes ( packet switches or routers ) .
packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in , first-out buffering , but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing , traffic shaping , or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service , such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket .
in case of a shared physical medium ( such as radio or 10base5 ) , the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme .

in connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information .
the packets are routed individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery .
each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . it may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet .
at the destination , the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number .
the packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , timestamp , or sequence number , which is different for different packets .
routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table .
the packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking .
connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication .
both x.25 and frame relay provide connection-oriented operations . but x.25 does it at the network layer of the osi model . frame relay does it at level two , the data link layer .
however , x.25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted by the internet protocol ( ip ) at the network layer , and the asynchronous transfer mode ( atm ) and or versions of multi-protocol label switching ( mpls ) at layer two .
for a while , frame relay was used to interconnect lans across wide area networks . however , x.25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted by the internet protocol ( ip ) at the network layer , and the asynchronous transfer mode ( atm ) and or versions of multi-protocol label switching ( mpls ) at layer two .
a typical configuration is to run ip over atm or a version of mpls .
arpanet and sita hln became operational in 1969. before the introduction of x.25 in 1973 , about twenty different network technologies had been developed .
two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core .
in the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host .
the user datagram protocol ( udp ) is an example of a datagram protocol .
appletalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by apple inc. in 1985 for apple macintosh computers .
appletalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server .
the appletalk system automatically assigned addresses , updated the distributed namespace , and configured any required inter-network routing .
it was a plug-n-play system .
the cyclades packet switching network was a french research network designed and directed by louis pouzin .
it was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data , rather than the network itself , using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms .

however , decnet phase ii ( and later ) were open standards with published specifications , and several implementations were developed outside dec , including one for linux .
in 1965 , at the instigation of warner sinback , a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect ge 's four computer sales and service centers ( schenectady , phoenix , chicago , and phoenix ) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service , apparently the world 's first commercial online service .

they lost money from the beginning , and sinback , a high-level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around .
he decided that a time-sharing system , based on kemney 's work at dartmouth—which used a computer on loan from ge—could be profitable .
merit network , inc. , an independent non-profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) corporation governed by michigan 's public universities , was formed in 1966 as the michigan educational research information triad to explore computer networking between three of michigan 's public universities as a means to help the state 's educational and economic development .
with initial support from the state of michigan and the national science foundation ( nsf ) , the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in december 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the ibm mainframe computer systems at the university of michigan in ann arbor and wayne state university in detroit .
over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections , host to host batch connections ( remote job submission , remote printing , batch file transfer ) , interactive file transfer , gateways to the tymnet and telenet public data networks , x.25 host attachments , gateways to x.25 data networks , ethernet attached hosts , and eventually tcp/ip and additional public universities in michigan join the network .
telenet was the first fcc-licensed public data network in the united states .
it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public .
it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public .
it initially used arpanet technology but changed the host interface to x.25 and the terminal interface to x.29 .
telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. it went public in 1979 and was then sold to gte .
tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in san jose , ca that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used x.25 , sna/sdlc , bsc and ascii interfaces to connect host computers ( servers ) at thousands of large companies , educational institutions , and government agencies .

users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections .
the business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies ( mostly banks and airlines ) to build their own dedicated networks .
the private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network .
there were two kinds of x.25 networks . some such as datapac and transpac were initially implemented with an x.25 external interface .
datapac was developed by bell northern research which was a joint venture of bell canada ( a common carrier ) and northern telecom ( a telecommunications equipment supplier ) .
a user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the dnic of the remote network as part of the destination address .
austpac was an australian public x.25 network operated by telstra .
started by telecom australia in the early 1980s , austpac was australia 's first public packet-switched data network , supporting applications such as on-line betting , financial applications — the australian tax office made use of austpac — and remote terminal access to academic institutions , who maintained their connections to austpac up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases .
access can be via a dial-up terminal to a pad , or , by linking a permanent x.25 node to the network .
datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the dutch ptt telecom ( now known as kpn ) .
strictly speaking datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines ( using the x.121 dnic 2041 ) , the name also referred to the public pad service telepad ( using the dnic 2049 ) .

although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of kpn contributed to the confusion .
the computer science network ( csnet ) was a computer network funded by the u.s. national science foundation ( nsf ) that began operation in 1981. its purpose was to extend networking benefits , for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to arpanet , due to funding or authorization limitations .

it played a significant role in spreading awareness of , and access to , national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global internet .
internet2 is a not-for-profit united states computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities , industry , and government .
the internet2 community , in partnership with qwest , built the first internet2 network , called abilene , in 1998 and was a prime investor in the national lambdarail ( nlr ) project .

in 2006 , internet2 announced a partnership with level 3 communications to launch a brand new nationwide network , boosting its capacity from 10 gbit/s to 100 gbit/s .
in october , 2007 , internet2 officially retired abilene and now refers to its new , higher capacity network as the internet2 network .
the national science foundation network ( nsfnet ) was a program of coordinated , evolving projects sponsored by the national science foundation ( nsf ) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the united states .
the national science foundation network ( nsfnet ) was a program of coordinated , evolving projects sponsored by the national science foundation ( nsf ) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the united states .
nsfnet was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks operating at speeds of 56 kbit/s , 1.5 mbit/s ( t1 ) , and 45 mbit/s ( t3 ) that were constructed to support nsf 's networking initiatives from 1985-1995. initially created to link researchers to the nation 's nsf-funded supercomputing centers , through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the internet backbone .
the very high-speed backbone network service ( vbns ) came on line in april 1995 as part of a national science foundation ( nsf ) sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between nsf-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the united states .

the network was engineered and operated by mci telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the nsf .
by 1998 , the vbns had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with ds-3 ( 45 mbit/s ) , oc-3c ( 155 mbit/s ) , and oc-12c ( 622 mbit/s ) links on an all oc-12c backbone , a substantial engineering feat for that time .
the vbns installed one of the first ever production oc-48c ( 2.5 gbit/s ) ip links in february 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to oc-48c .
the black death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia , where it then travelled along the silk road , reaching crimea by 1343. from there , it was most likely carried by oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships .

spreading throughout the mediterranean and europe , the black death is estimated to have killed 30–60 % of europe 's total population .
the world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century .
the plague recurred occasionally in europe until the 19th century .
the plague disease , caused by yersinia pestis , is enzootic ( commonly present ) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents , including marmots , in various areas including central asia , kurdistan , western asia , northern india and uganda .
nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near lake issyk kul in kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic , from which it could easily have spread to china and india .
in october 2010 , medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in china .
in the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine , starting in 1331 , with a deadly plague arriving soon after .
epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million chinese and other asians during the 15 years before it reached constantinople in 1347 .
plague was reportedly first introduced to europe via genoese traders at the port city of kaffa in the crimea in 1347. after a protracted siege , during which the mongol army under jani beg was suffering from the disease , the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of kaffa to infect the inhabitants .

the genoese traders fled , taking the plague by ship into sicily and the south of europe , whence it spread north .
whether or not this hypothesis is accurate , it is clear that several existing conditions such as war , famine , and weather contributed to the severity of the black death .
from italy , the disease spread northwest across europe , striking france , spain , portugal and england by june 1348 , then turned and spread east through germany and scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. it was introduced in norway in 1349 when a ship landed at askøy , then spread to bjørgvin ( modern bergen ) and iceland .
finally it spread to northwestern russia in 1351. the plague was somewhat less common in parts of europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours , including the kingdom of poland , the majority of the basque country , isolated parts of belgium and the netherlands , and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent .

the plague struck various countries in the middle east during the pandemic , leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures .
by autumn 1347 , the plague reached alexandria in egypt , probably through the port 's trade with constantinople , and ports on the black sea .

in england , it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the black death .
the name spread through scandinavia and then germany , gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name .
the most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in paris in a report to the king of france that blamed the heavens , in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a " great pestilence in the air " .

that the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory .
today , this is known as the miasma theory .
the dominant explanation for the black death is the plague theory , which attributes the outbreak to yersinia pestis , also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern china in 1865 , eventually spreading to india .
the investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited hong kong in 1894 , among whom was the french-swiss bacteriologist alexandre yersin , after whom the pathogen was named yersinia pestis .

the mechanism by which y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by paul-louis simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host .
the bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents : one resistant to the disease , which act as hosts , keeping the disease endemic , and a second that lack resistance .
the historian francis aidan gasquet wrote about the 'great pestilence ' in 1893 and suggested that " it would appear to be some form of the ordinary eastern or bubonic plague " .

he was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the black death for the second edition in 1908 , implicating rats and fleas in the process , and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics , such as the justinian plague that was prevalent in the eastern roman empire from 541 to 700 ce .

left untreated , of those that contract the bubonic plague , 80 percent die within eight days .
pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent .
symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ( purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation ) .
in october 2010 , the open-access scientific journal plos pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of yersinia pestis in the black death following the disputed identification by drancourt and raoult in 1998. they assessed the presence of dna/rna with polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) techniques for y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern , central and southern europe that were associated archaeologically with the black death and subsequent resurgences .

ends the debate about the etiology of the black death , and unambiguously demonstrates that y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated europe during the middle ages " .
the study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades ( genetic branches ) of the y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves .
these clades ( which are thought to be extinct ) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern y. pestis strains y. p. orientalis and y. p. medievalis , suggesting the plague may have entered europe in two waves .

surveys of plague pit remains in france and england indicate the first variant entered europe through the port of marseille around november 1347 and spread through france over the next two years , eventually reaching england in the spring of 1349 , where it spread through the country in three epidemics .

the results of the haensch study have since been confirmed and amended .
based on genetic evidence derived from black death victims in the east smithfield burial site in england , schuenemann et al .
concluded in 2011 " that the black death in medieval europe was caused by a variant of y. pestis that may no longer exist . "
a study published in nature in october 2011 sequenced the genome of y. pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the black death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease .
the plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of british bacteriologist j. f. d. shrewsbury in 1970 , who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague , leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations .

in 1984 zoologist graham twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly , and his doubts about the identity of the black death have been taken up by a number of authors , including samuel k. cohn , jr. ( 2002 ) , david herlihy ( 1997 ) , and susan scott and christopher duncan ( 2001 ) .

it is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms , but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period .

most work has been done on the spread of the plague in england , and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100 % as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the domesday book and the year 1377. estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy .

in addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic , sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the black death are not unique ( and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague ) ; that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance ; and that the dna results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere , despite extensive samples from other mass graves .

other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries ; temperatures that are too cold in northern europe for the survival of fleas ; that , despite primitive transport systems , the spread of the black death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague ; that mortality rates of the black death appear to be very high ; that , while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease , the black death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas ; and that the pattern of the black death , with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years , differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups .

twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax , and norman cantor ( 2001 ) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics .

many scholars arguing for the y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases , including typhus , smallpox and respiratory infections .
in addition to the bubonic infection , others point to additional septicemic ( a type of " blood poisoning " ) and pneumonic ( an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body ) forms of the plague , which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms .
in 2014 , scientists with public health england announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the clerkenwell area of london , as well as of wills registered in london during the period , which supported the pneumonic hypothesis .
the most widely accepted estimate for the middle east , including iraq , iran and syria , during this time , is for a death rate of about a third .
half of paris 's population of 100,000 people died .
interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead , recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in central london found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated , evenly spaced graves , suggesting at least some pre-planning and christian burials at this time .
in crowded cities , it was not uncommon for as much as 50 % of the population to die .
the disease bypassed some areas , and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion .
the plague repeatedly returned to haunt europe and the mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries .
according to biraben , the plague was present somewhere in europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. the second pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years : 1360–63 ; 1374 ; 1400 ; 1438–39 ; 1456–57 ; 1464–66 ; 1481–85 ; 1500–03 ; 1518–31 ; 1544–48 ; 1563–66 ; 1573–88 ; 1596–99 ; 1602–11 ; 1623–40 ; 1644–54 ; and 1664–67 .
according to geoffrey parker , " france alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31 . "
in england , in the absence of census figures , historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300 , and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million .
by the end of 1350 , the black death subsided , but it never really died out in england .
an outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15 % of the population , while the death rate of the plague of 1479–80 could have been as high as 20 % .
the most general outbreaks in tudor and stuart england seem to have begun in 1498 , 1535 , 1543 , 1563 , 1589 , 1603 , 1625 , and 1636 , and ended with the great plague of london in 1665 .
in 1466 , perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in paris .
the black death ravaged europe for three years before it continued on into russia , where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. plague epidemics ravaged london in 1563 , 1593 , 1603 , 1625 , 1636 , and 1665 , reducing its population by 10 to 30 % during those years .
late outbreaks in central europe included the italian plague of 1629–1631 , which is associated with troop movements during the thirty years ' war , and the great plague of vienna in 1679. over 60 % of norway 's population died in 1348–50 .
the last plague outbreak ravaged oslo in 1654 .
over 10 % of amsterdam 's population died in 1623–25 , and again in 1635–36 , 1655 , and 1664. plague occurred in venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. the plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in venice , almost a third of the population .
in the first half of the 17th century , a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in italy , or about 14 % of the population .
in 1656 , the plague killed about half of naples ' 300,000 inhabitants .
the plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of seville by half .
in 1709–13 , a plague epidemic that followed the great northern war ( 1700–21 , sweden v. russia and allies ) killed about 100,000 in sweden , and 300,000 in prussia .
europe 's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in marseille .
plague was present in at least one location in the islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850. plague repeatedly struck the cities of north africa .
algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620–21 , and again in 1654–57 , 1665 , 1691 , and 1740–42 .
plague remained a major event in ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century .
between 1701 and 1750 , thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in constantinople , and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800. baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague , and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out .
when a rock crystallizes from melt ( magma and/or lava ) , it is an igneous rock .
the sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered , eroded , deposited , and lithified , ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock .
all three types of rocks may be re-melted ; when this happens , a new magma is formed , from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize .
there are three major types of rock : igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic .
this rock can be weathered and eroded , and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock , or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric .
in the 1960s , a series of discoveries , the most important of which was seafloor spreading , showed that the earth 's lithosphere , which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle , is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming , solid , upper mantle , which is called the asthenosphere .

this coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics .

mid-ocean ridges , high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist , were explained as divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart .
arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries , where one plate subducts under another .
transform boundaries , such as the san andreas fault system , resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes .
plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for alfred wegener 's theory of continental drift , in which the continents move across the surface of the earth over geologic time .
the power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle .
seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the earth .
these advances led to the development of a layered model of the earth , with a crust and lithosphere on top , the mantle below ( separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers ) , and the outer core and inner core below that .

more recently , seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a ct scan .

therefore , the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale .
since the quaternary is a very short period with short epochs , it is further expanded in the fourth scale .
the holocene ( the latest epoch ) is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right , another reason for expanding the fourth scale .
q stands for the quaternary period .
the principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut .
faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault .
finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault .
faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault .
as a result , xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them .
these foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows , and are incorporated , later to cool in the matrix .
the principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions ( or clasts ) are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them .
the principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions ( or clasts ) are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them .
for example , in sedimentary rocks , it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer .
the principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks .
based on principles laid out by william smith almost a hundred years before the publication of charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought .
the principle becomes quite complex , however , given the uncertainties of fossilization , the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ( facies change in sedimentary strata ) , and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time .
as organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world , their presence or ( sometimes ) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found .

at the beginning of the 20th century , important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods .
previously , geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another .
with isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages .

thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust , the uplift of mountain ranges , and paleotopography .
for many geologic applications , isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature , the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice .

dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques .
when rock units are placed under horizontal compression , they shorten and become thicker .
in the shallow crust , where brittle deformation can occur , thrust faults form , which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock .
these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating " antiforms " , or where it buckles downwards , creating " synforms " .
these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating " antiforms " , or where it buckles downwards , creating " synforms " .
if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards , they are called anticlines and synclines , respectively .
extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner .
these stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses , known as boudins , after the french word for " sausage " , because of their visual similarity .
stretching of units can result in their thinning ; in fact , there is a location within the maria fold and thrust belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the grand canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter .
rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed .
this is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning .
dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed .
dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed .
faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients , causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels .
continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment , and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit .
deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity .
the hawaiian islands , for example , consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows .
even older rocks , such as the acasta gneiss of the slave craton in northwestern canada , the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis .
the sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental united states and the grand canyon in the southwestern united states contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since cambrian time .

in many cases , geologists also study modern soils , rivers , landscapes , and glaciers ; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways , and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface .
in addition to identifying rocks in the field , petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory .
in an optical mineralogy analysis , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties with a conoscopic lens .
stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units .

this research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks .
structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks .
structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks .
they also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area .
in addition , they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings .
among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges , which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries .

in the analog versions of these experiments , horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop , which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered ( all angles remain the same ) orogenic wedge .

numerical models work in the same way as these analog models , though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt .
in the laboratory , stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field , such as those from drill cores .
stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface .
geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface , and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions .

stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the earth , interpret past environments , and locate areas for water , coal , and hydrocarbon extraction .
geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition .
in the laboratory , biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them .
magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores .

some modern scholars , such as fielding h. garrison , are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to persia after the muslim conquests had come to an end .
abu al-rayhan al-biruni ( 973–1048 ce ) was one of the earliest persian geologists , whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of india , hypothesizing that the indian subcontinent was once a sea .
in china , the polymath shen kuo ( 1031–1095 ) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation : based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean , he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt .
drawing from greek and indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the muslim conquests , the persian scholar ibn sina ( avicenna , 981–1037 ) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains , the origin of earthquakes , and other topics central to modern geology , which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science .

james hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist .
in 1785 he presented a paper entitled theory of the earth to the royal society of edinburgh .
hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 ( vol .
in his paper , he explained his theory that the earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea , which in turn were raised up to become dry land .

the population of pons aelius at this period was estimated at 2,000. fragments of hadrian 's wall are still visible in parts of newcastle , particularly along the west road .
the extent of hadrian 's wall was 73 miles ( 117 km ) , spanning the width of britain ; the wall incorporated the vallum , a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds , and was constructed primarily for defence , to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of pictish tribes from the north , not as a fighting line for a major invasion .
throughout the middle ages , newcastle was england 's northern fortress .
incorporated first by henry ii , the city had a new charter granted by elizabeth in 1589. a 25-foot ( 7.6 m ) high stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century , to defend it from invaders during the border war against scotland .

the scots king william the lion was imprisoned in newcastle in 1174 , and edward i brought the stone of scone and william wallace south through the town .
newcastle was successfully defended against the scots three times during the 14th century , and was created a county corporate with its own sheriff by henry iv in 1400 .
from 1530 a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from tyneside to newcastle quayside , giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of newcastle burgesses known as the hostmen .

the phrase taking coals to newcastle was first recorded contextually in 1538. the phrase itself means a pointless pursuit .
in the 18th century american timothy dexter , an entrepreneur , widely regarded as an eccentric , defied this idiom .
he was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him ; however his shipment arrived on the tyne during a strike that had crippled local production ; unexpectedly he made a considerable profit .
in the sandgate area , to the east of the city and beside the river , resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families .
they were so called because they worked on the keels , boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers , for export to london and elsewhere .
in the 1630s about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of newcastle died of plague , more than one-third of the population .
specifically within the year 1636 , it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the society of antiquaries that 47 % of the then population of newcastle died from the epidemic ; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any british city in this period .

during the english civil war , the north declared for the king .
in a bid to gain newcastle and the tyne , cromwell 's allies , the scots , captured the town of newburn .
in 1644 the city was then besieged for many months and was eventually stormed ( 'with roaring drummes ' ) and sacked by cromwell 's allies .
the grateful king bestowed the motto " fortiter defendit triumphans " ( " triumphing by a brave defence " ) upon the town .
charles i was imprisoned in newcastle by the scots in 1646–7 .
this revolution resulted in the urbanization of the city .
in 1817 the maling company , at one time the largest pottery company in the world , moved to the city .
newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting .
in the 19th century , shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city 's prosperity ; and the city was a powerhouse of the industrial revolution .
innovations in newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps , stephenson 's rocket , lord armstrong 's artillery , be-ro flour , joseph swan 's electric light bulbs , and charles parsons ' invention of the steam turbine , which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity .
in large parts , newcastle still retains a medieval street layout .
narrow alleys or 'chares ' , most of which can only be traversed by foot , still exist in abundance , particularly around the riverside .

the dialect of newcastle is known as geordie , and contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive word pronunciations not used in other parts of the united kingdom .
the geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the anglo-saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of england after the end of roman imperial rule .
this language was the forerunner of modern english ; but while the dialects of other english regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages—particularly latin and norman french—the geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language .
an example of this is the pronunciation of certain words : " dead " , " cow " , " house " and " strong " are pronounced " deed " , " coo " , " hoos " and " strang " —which is how they were pronounced in the anglo-saxon language .
other geordie words with anglo-saxon origins include : " larn " ( from the anglo-saxon " laeran " , meaning " teach " ) , " burn " ( " stream " ) and " gan " ( " go " ) .
" bairn " and " hyem " , meaning " child " and " home " , respectively , are examples of geordie words with origins in scandinavia ; barn and hjem are the corresponding modern norwegian and danish words .
some words used in the geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the northern united kingdom .
the words " bonny " ( meaning " pretty " ) , " howay " ( " come on " ) , " stot " ( " bounce " ) and " hadaway " ( " go away " or " you 're kidding " ) , all appear to be used in scots ; " aye " ( " yes " ) and " nowt " ( ipa : //naʊt/ , rhymes with out , " nothing " ) are used elsewhere in northern england .
many words , however , appear to be used exclusively in newcastle and the surrounding area , such as " canny " ( a versatile word meaning " good " , " nice " or " very " ) , " hacky " ( " dirty " ) , " netty " ( " toilet " ) , " hoy " ( " throw " , from the dutch gooien , via west frisian ) , " hockle " ( " spit " ) .
