however , abc made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming , with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of nbc and cbs , adopting the use of the magnetophon tape recorder , brought to the u.s. from nazi germany after its conquest , to pre-record its programming .
abc became an aggressive competitor to nbc and cbs when , continuing nbc blue 's traditions of public service , it aired symphony performances conducted by paul whiteman , performances from the metropolitan opera , and jazz concerts aired as part of its broadcast of the chamber music society of lower basin street announced by milton cross .

a second period of international expansion is linked to that of the espn network in the 1990s , and policies enacted in the 2000s by disney media networks ( which included the expansion of several of the company 's u.s.-based cable networks including disney channel and its spinoffs toon disney , playhouse disney and jetix ; although disney also sold its 33 % stake in european sports channel eurosport for $ 155 million in june 2000 ) .
the policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on september 27 of that year , abc announced the launch of abc1 , a free-to-air channel in the united kingdom owned by the abc group .
however , on september 8 , 2007 , disney announced that it would discontinue abc1 citing to the channel 's inability to attain sustainable viewership .
with abc1 's shutdown that october , the company 's attempt to develop abc international were discontinued .
in contrast to disney 's other channels , abc is broadcast in the united states , although the network 's programming is syndicated in many countries .
in 1959 , this rerun activity was completed with program syndication , with abc films selling programs to networks not owned by abc .
the arrival of satellite television ended the need for abc to hold interests in other countries ; many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties .
as a result , abc was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks , mainly in japan and latin america , in the 1970s .

on july 31 , 1995 , the walt disney company announced an agreement to merge with capital cities/abc for $ 19 billion .
disney shareholders approved the merger at a special conference in new york city on january 4 , 1996 , with the acquisition of capital cities/abc being completed on february 9 ; following the sale , disney renamed its new subsidiary abc inc. in addition to the abc network , the disney acquisition integrated abc 's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations ; its 80 % interest in espn , ownership interests in the history channel , a & e television networks , and lifetime entertainment ; and capital cities/abc 's magazine and newspaper properties into the company .
on april 4 , disney sold the four newspapers that abc had controlled under capital cities to knight ridder for $ 1.65 billion .
following the merger , thomas s. murphy left abc with robert iger taking his place as president and ceo .
in 1998 , abc premiered the aaron sorkin-created sitcom sports night , centering on the travails of the staff of a sportscenter-style sports news program ; despite earning critical praise and multiple emmy awards , the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons .
it was not until the 1965–66 season that color became the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks .
abc , meanwhile , remained in third place and still needed money to grow itself into a major competitor .
however , abc 's issues with its transition to color became secondary compared to the network 's financial problems ; in 1964 , the network found itself , as goldenson later wrote in the 1991 book " beating the odds : the untold story behind the rise of abc " , " in the middle of a war [ where ] the battlefield was wall street " .
on may 1 , 1953 , abc 's new york city flagship stations – wjz , wjz-fm and wjz-tv – changed their respective callsigns to wabc , wabc-fm and wabc-tv , and moved their operations to facilities at 7 west 66th street , one block away from central park .

the wabc call letters were previously used by the flagship station of cbs radio ( now wcbs ( am ) ) until 1946. the wjz calls would later be reassigned to the then-abc affiliate in baltimore in 1959 , in an historical nod to the fact that wjz was originally established by the baltimore station 's owner at the time , westinghouse .
in 1950 , noble appointed robert kintner to be abc 's president while he himself served as its ceo , a position he would hold until his death in 1958. despite the promise of non-interference between abc and upt , goldenson had to intervene in abc 's decisions because of financial problems and the fcc 's long period of indecision .
goldenson added to the confusion when , in october 1954 , he proposed a merger between upt and the dumont television network , which was also mired in financial trouble .
as part of this merger , the network would have been renamed " abc-dumont " for five years , and dumont would have received $ 5 million in cash , room on the schedule for existing dumont programming , and guaranteed advertising time for dumont laboratories receivers .

at the same time he made attempts to help grow abc , goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in hollywood , with whom he had worked when upt was a subsidiary of paramount pictures .
abc 's flagship productions at the time were the lone ranger , based on the radio program of the same title , and the adventures of ozzie and harriet , the latter of which ( at 13 seasons , running from 1952 to 1965 ) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in u.s. television history , until it was surpassed by the simpsons in 2002 .

airing during the 1955–56 season , it showcased television adaptations of the 1942 films kings row and casablanca ; cheyenne ( adapted from the 1947 film wyoming kid ) ; sugarfoot ( a remake of the 1954 film the boy from oklahoma ) ; and maverick .

however , the most iconic of abc 's relationships with hollywood producers was its agreement with walt disney ; after the start of the network 's bond with the disney studio , james lewis baughman , who worked as a columnist at that time , observed that " at abc 's headquarters in new york , the secretaries [ were now ] wearing hats with mickey mouse ears " .
warner tried with mixed success to adapt some of its most successful films as abc television series , and showcase these adaptations as part of the wheel series warner bros. presents .
walt disney and his brother roy contacted goldenson at the end of 1953 for abc to agree to finance part of the disneyland project in exchange for producing a television program for the network .
walt wanted abc to invest $ 500,000 and accrued a guarantee of $ 4.5 million in additional loans , a third of the budget intended for the park .
around 1954 , abc agreed to finance disneyland in exchange for the right to broadcast a new sunday night program , disneyland , which debuted on the network on october 27 , 1954 as the first of many anthology television programs that disney would broadcast over the course of the next 50 years .

in july 1968 , abc radio launched a special programming project for its fm stations , which was spearheaded by allen shaw , a former program manager at wcfl in chicago who was approached by abc radio president harold l. neal to develop a format to compete with the new progressive rock and dj-helmed stations .

the new concept called " love radio " , which featured a limited selection of music genres , was launched on abc 's seven owned-and-operated fm stations in late november 1968 ; the concept replaced nearly all of the programming provided by these stations ; however , several affiliates ( such as kxyz ) retained the majority of their content .

on the television side , in september 1969 , abc launched the movie of the week , a weekly showcase aimed at capitalizing on the growing success of made-for-tv movies since the early 1960s .
the movie of the week broadcast feature-length dramatic films directed by such talented filmmakers as aaron spelling , david wolper and steven spielberg ( the latter of whom gained early success through the showcase for his 1971 film duel ) that were produced on an average budget of $ 400,000– $ 450,000 .

it also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine what types of sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences .
in 1970 , abc debuted monday night football as part of its monday prime time schedule ; the program became a hit for the network and served as the national football league ( nfl ) 's premier game of the week until 2006 , when sunday night football , which moved to nbc that year as part of a broadcast deal that in turn saw mnf move to espn , took over as the league 's marquee game .

according to goldenson , monday night football helped earn abc regularly score an audience share of 15 % –16 % ; abc sports managed the budget for the monday night time slot to reallocate the weekly budget for abc 's prime time schedule to just six days , as opposed to seven on competing networks .
in 1970 , the fcc voted to pass the financial interest and syndication rules , a set of regulations aimed at preventing the major networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by barring them from owning any of the prime time programming that they broadcast .
in 1972 , the new rules resulted in the company 's decision to split abc films into two separate companies : the existing worldvision enterprises , which would produce and distribute programming for u.s. syndication , and abc circle films as a production unit .

in the early 1970s , michael eisner , who joined abc in 1966 , became the network 's program development manager .
he helped bring about ideas for many series including happy days ( which originated as a segment on the anthology series love , american style ) , as well as several soap operas ; however , eisner 's main credit at abc was for developing youth-oriented programming .

in 1974 , abc premiered the detective series s.w.a.t .

many of these series were greenlit by silverman , who left abc in 1978 to become president of nbc 's entertainment division .
the rousing success of happy days also led to a successful spin-off series , laverne & shirley , which debuted in 1976. charlie 's angels and three 's company ( which debuted in 1977 ) were two prime examples of a trend among the major networks during the 1970s known as " jiggle tv " , featuring attractive , often buxom , women in main and guest roles .

when the abc-upt merger was finalized in 1953 , the network introduced a new logo based on the seal of the federal communications commission , with the letters " abc " enclosed in a circular shield surmounted by the bald eagle .
in 1957 , just before the television network began its first color broadcasts , the abc logo consisted of a tiny lowercase " abc " in the center of a large lowercase letter a , a design known as the " abc circle a " .

the network 's troubles with sustaining existing series and gaining new hits spilled over into its 2010–11 schedule : abc 's dramas during that season continued to fail , with the midseason forensic investigation drama body of proof being the only one that was renewed for a second season .
the network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year 's debuts , with only late-season premiere happy endings earning a second season .
despite this and another noticeable ratings decline , abc would manage to outrate nbc for third place by a larger margin than the previous year .
meanwhile , the new lows hit by brothers & sisters led to its cancellation , and the previous year 's only drama renewal , v , also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run .
on april 14 , 2011 , abc canceled the long-running soap operas all my children and one life to live after 41 and 43 years on the air , respectively ( following backlash from fans , abc sold the rights to both shows to prospect park , which eventually revived the soaps on hulu for one additional season in 2013 and with both companies suing one another for allegations of interference with the process of reviving the shows , failure to pay licensing fees and issues over abc 's use of certain characters from one live to live on general hospital during the transition ) .

among the few bright spots during this season were the midseason crime dramedy castle as well as the success of two family sitcoms that anchored the network 's revamped wednesday comedy lineup , the middle and modern family , the latter of which was both a critical and commercial success .
shark tank ( based on the dragon 's den reality format ) also became a midseason sleeper hit on sundays in the spring of 2010 ; the following season , it became the tentpole of the network 's friday night schedule , gradually helping make abc a strong competitor ( after being paired with 20/20 and beginning with the 2012–13 season , the tim allen sitcom last man standing ) against cbs ' long-dominant drama/reality lineup on that night for the first time since the " tgif " lineup ended in 2000 .

as a result , with the exception of the largest markets , abc was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations , usually via off-hours clearances ( a notable exception during this time was wkst-tv in youngstown , ohio , now wytv , despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to cleveland and pittsburgh even decades before the city 's economic collapse ) .
according to goldenson , this meant that an hour of abc programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors .
still , abc 's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades ; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time abc affiliate until the 1960s , with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s , which allowed stations like wtrf-tv in wheeling , west virginia to begin airing abc programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network 's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before .

to counteract nbc , abc decided to refocus itself on comedies and family-oriented series beginning in the mid-1980s including mr. belvedere , roseanne , who 's the boss ? , just the ten of us , the wonder years , full house and perfect strangers .
following the initial success of these series , abc revamped its friday night schedule around family-friendly comedies in the late 1980s , culminating in the 1989 debut of the " tgif " block ( which promotions referenced stood for " thank goodness it 's funny " ) .

many of the series featured during the run of the block were produced by miller-boyett productions , a warner bros.-based studio that briefly programmed the entire friday lineup during the 1990–91 season ( with going places joining family matters , full house and perfect strangers on the " tgif " schedule ) and through its development deal with paramount television prior to 1986 ( as miller-milkis , and later , miller-milkis-boyett productions ) , had earlier produced happy days and its various spinoffs among other series for the network .

in 1968 , abc took advantage of new fcc ownership regulations that allowed broadcasting companies to own a maximum of seven radio stations nationwide in order to purchase houston radio stations kxyz and kxyz-fm for $ 1 million in shares and $ 1.5 million in bonds .
that year , roone arledge was named president of abc sports ; the company also founded abc pictures , a film production company which released its first picture that year , the ralph nelson-directed charly .

it was renamed abc motion pictures in 1979 ; the unit was dissolved in 1985. the studio also operated two subsidiaries , palomar pictures international and selmur pictures .
in july 1968 , abc continued its acquisitions in the amusement parks sector with the opening of abc marine world in redwood city , california ; that park was sold in 1972 and demolished in 1986 , with the land that occupied the park later becoming home to the headquarters of oracle corporation .
it was not until the late 1950s that the abc network became a serious contender to nbc and cbs , and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public , such as westerns and detective series .
despite an almost 500 % increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958 , the network only had a national reach of between 10 % and 18 % of the total u.s. population , as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than nbc and cbs .

in 1957 , abc entertainment president ollie treiz discovered that the locally produced variety show bandstand had pulled very strong ratings in the philadelphia market on wfil-tv ; treiz ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national , under the revised title american bandstand ; the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to america 's youth and helped make a star out of its host , dick clark .

these kinds of programs presented abc with an image of the " philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors " , offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks , which helped goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television .
abc 's western series ( as well as series such as the actioner zorro ) went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by nbc and cbs in the fall of 1957 , and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959. to captivate the network 's audiences , short 66-minute series were scheduled a half-hour before their hour-long competition .
in may 1961 , life criticized the public enthusiasm and sponsorship for these types of shows at the expense of news programming and denounced an unofficial law " replacing the good programs with the bad ones " .

in may 2013 , abc launched " watch abc " , a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network 's existing streaming portal at abc.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers ; in addition to providing full-length episodes of abc programs , the service allows live programming streams of local abc affiliates in select markets ( the first such offering by a u.s. broadcast network ) .
new york city o & o wabc-tv and philadelphia o & o wpvi-tv were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service ( with a free preview for non-subscribers through june 2013 ) , with the six remaining abc o & os offering streams by the start of the 2013–14 season .
hearst television also reached a deal to offer streams of its abc affiliates ( including stations in boston , kansas city , milwaukee and west palm beach ) on the service .
similar to sister network espn 's watchespn service ( which originated the " watch " brand used by the streaming services of disney 's television networks ) , live streams of abc stations are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers in certain markets .

after founding the mongol empire and being proclaimed " genghis khan " , he started the mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of eurasia .
he came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of northeast asia .
these campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations – especially in the khwarezmian and xia controlled lands .
by the end of his life , the mongol empire occupied a substantial portion of central asia and china .
these included raids or invasions of the qara khitai , caucasus , khwarezmid empire , western xia and jin dynasties .
before genghis khan died , he assigned ögedei khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons .
he died in 1227 after defeating the western xia .

he was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in mongolia at an unknown location .
temüjin was probably born in 1162 in delüün boldog , near burkhan khaldun mountain and the onon and kherlen rivers in modern-day northern mongolia , not far from the current capital ulaanbaatar .
he was the second-oldest son of his father yesügei , a khamag mongol 's major chief of the kiyad and an ally of toghrul khan of the keraite tribe , and the oldest son of his mother hoelun .
temüjin was probably born in 1162 in delüün boldog , near burkhan khaldun mountain and the onon and kherlen rivers in modern-day northern mongolia , not far from the current capital ulaanbaatar .
according to the secret history , temüjin was named after a tatar chieftain , temüjin-üge , whom his father had just captured .
temüjin had three brothers named hasar , hachiun , and temüge , and one sister named temülen , as well as two half-brothers named begter and belgutei .

temüjin was to live there in service to dai setsen , the head of the new household , until he reached the marriageable age of 12 .
begter , temujin 's older half-brother , began to exercise the power of the eldest male in the family and eventually temujin 's mother hoelun ( not begter 's mother ) would have to accept him as her husband if and when he became an adult .

in another incident , around 1177 , he was captured in a raid and held prisoner by his father 's former allies , the tayichi'ud .
the tayichi'ud enslaved temüjin ( reportedly with a cangue , a sort of portable stocks ) , but with the help of a sympathetic guard , the father of chilaun ( who later became a general of genghis khan ) , he was able to escape from the ger ( yurt ) in the middle of the night by hiding in a river crevice .

at this time , none of the tribal confederations of mongolia were united politically , and arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances .
temüjin 's mother hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of mongolia , especially the need for alliances .
temüjin grew up observing the tough political climate of mongolia , which included tribal warfare , thievery , raids , corruption , and continual acts of revenge carried out between the various confederations , all compounded by interference from foreign forces such as the chinese dynasties to the south .
temüjin 's mother hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of mongolia , especially the need for alliances .
as previously arranged by his father , temüjin married börte of the onggirat tribe when he was around 16 in order to cement alliances between their respective tribes .
soon after börte 's marriage to temüjin , she was kidnapped by the merkits and reportedly given away as a wife .
temüjin rescued her with the help of his friend and future rival , jamukha , and his protector , toghrul khan of the keraite tribe .
she gave birth to a son , jochi ( 1185–1226 ) , nine months later , clouding the issue of his parentage .

the names of at least six daughters are known , and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime , no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of genghis khan .
temüjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally ( or , according to other sources , a vassal ) to his father 's anda ( sworn brother or blood brother ) toghrul , who was khan of the keraites , and is better known by the chinese title " wang khan " , which the jurchen jin dynasty granted him in 1197. this relationship was first reinforced when börte was captured by the merkits .

temüjin turned to toghrul for support , and in response , toghrul offered his vassal 20,000 of his keraite warriors and suggested that he also involve his childhood friend jamukha , who had himself become khan ( ruler ) of his own tribe , the jadaran .

jamukha supported the traditional mongolian aristocracy , while temüjin followed a meritocratic method , and attracted a broader , though lower class , range of followers .
due to his earlier defeat of the merkits , and a proclamation by the shaman kokochu that the eternal blue sky had set aside the world for temüjin , temüjin began rising to power .
in 1186 , temüjin was elected khan of the mongols .
temüjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack , but he was decisively beaten in the battle of dalan balzhut .
toghrul , as temüjin 's patron , was exiled to the qara khitai .
as an incentive for absolute obedience and following his rule of law , the yassa code , temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils .

he would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe , bringing them into his family .
instead , he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe .
one of the later ruptures between toghrul and temüjin was toghrul 's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to jochi , the eldest son of temüjin , a sign of disrespect in the mongolian culture .
toghrul allied himself with jamukha , who already opposed temüjin 's forces ; however , the internal dispute between toghrul and jamukha , plus the desertion of a number of their allies to temüjin , led to toghrul 's defeat .
jamukha escaped during the conflict .
this defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the keraite tribe .
the next direct threat to temüjin was the naimans ( naiman mongols ) , with whom jamukha and his followers took refuge .
in 1201 , a khuruldai elected jamukha as gür khan , " universal ruler " , a title used by the rulers of the qara khitai .
in 1201 , a khuruldai elected jamukha as gür khan , " universal ruler " , a title used by the rulers of the qara khitai .
before the conflict , however , several generals abandoned jamukha , including subutai , jelme 's well-known younger brother .
after several battles , jamukha was finally turned over to temüjin by his own men in 1206 .
according to the secret history , temüjin again offered his friendship to jamukha , asking him to return to his side .
temüjin had killed the men who betrayed jamukha , stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army .
jamukha refused the offer of friendship and reunion , saying that there can only be one sun in the sky , and he asked for a noble death .
the custom is to die without spilling blood , which is granted by breaking the back .
he seemed to be a quick student , adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered , such as siege warfare from the chinese .
he was also ruthless , demonstrated by his tactic of measuring against the linchpin , used against the tribes led by jamukha .
these include rifts with his early allies such as jamukha ( who also wanted to be a ruler of mongol tribes ) and wang khan ( his and his father 's ally ) , his son jochi , and problems with the most important shaman , who was allegedly trying to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother khasar .
his military strategies showed a deep interest in gathering good intelligence and understanding the motivations of his rivals , exemplified by his extensive spy network and yam route systems .

as a result , by 1206 temüjin had managed to unite or subdue the merkits , naimans , mongols , keraites , tatars , uyghurs , and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule .
at a khuruldai , a council of mongol chiefs , temüjin was acknowledged as " khan " of the consolidated tribes and took the new title " genghis khan " .
the title khagan was not conferred on genghis until after his death , when his son and successor , ögedei , took the title for himself and extended it posthumously to his father ( as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the yuan dynasty ) .

in 1211 , after the conquest of western xia , genghis khan planned again to conquer the jin dynasty .
instead , the jin commander sent a messenger , ming-tan , to the mongol side , who defected and told the mongols that the jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass .
in 1215 genghis besieged , captured , and sacked the jin capital of zhongdu ( modern-day beijing ) .
this forced the emperor xuanzong to move his capital south to kaifeng , abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the mongols .
between 1232 and 1233 , kaifeng fell to the mongols under the reign of genghis ' third son , ögedei khan .
kuchlug , the deposed khan of the naiman confederation that temüjin defeated and folded into his mongol empire , fled west and usurped the khanate of qara khitai ( also known as the western liao , as it was originally established as remnants of the liao dynasty ) .

therefore , genghis sent only two tumen ( 20,000 soldiers ) against kuchlug , under his younger general , jebe , known as " the arrow " .

therefore , genghis sent only two tumen ( 20,000 soldiers ) against kuchlug , under his younger general , jebe , known as " the arrow " .
with such a small force , the invading mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among kuchlug 's supporters , leaving the qara khitai more vulnerable to mongol conquest .
as a result , kuchlug 's army was defeated west of kashgar .
by 1218 , as a result of defeat of qara khitai , the mongol empire and its control extended as far west as lake balkhash , which bordered the khwarezmia ( khwarezmid empire ) , a muslim state that reached the caspian sea to the west and persian gulf and the arabian sea to the south .

in the early 13th century , the khwarazmian dynasty was governed by shah ala ad-din muhammad .
however , inalchuq , the governor of the khwarezmian city of otrar , attacked the caravan that came from mongolia , claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against khwarezmia .
the shah had all the men shaved and the muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors .
outraged , genghis khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers ( 10 tumens ) , his most capable generals and some of his sons .
genghis khan saw the potential advantage in khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the silk road , and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire .
the mongol army under genghis khan , generals and his sons crossed the tien shan mountains by entering the area controlled by the khwarezmian empire .
after compiling intelligence from many sources genghis khan carefully prepared his army , which was divided into three groups .
the second division under jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of khwarzemia to form , with the first division , a pincer attack on samarkand .
the third division under genghis khan and tolui marched to the northwest and attacked khwarzemia from that direction .
the second division under jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of khwarzemia to form , with the first division , a pincer attack on samarkand .
this fragmentation was decisive in khwarezmia 's defeats , as it allowed the mongols , although exhausted from the long journey , to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense .
the mongol army quickly seized the town of otrar , relying on superior strategy and tactics .
genghis khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians , enslaved the rest of the population and executed inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes , as retribution for his actions .
near the end of the battle the shah fled rather than surrender .
genghis khan ordered subutai and jebe to hunt him down , giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this .
after the capital samarkand fell , the capital was moved to bukhara by the remaining men , while genghis khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the khwarezmid empire , including not only royal buildings , but entire towns , populations , and even vast swaths of farmland .

according to legend , genghis khan even went so far as to divert a river through the khwarezmid emperor 's birthplace , erasing it from the map .
the mongols attacked samarkand using captured enemies as body shields .
after the fortress fell , genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at samarkand .
the people of samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city , where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory .
the city leaders opened the gates to the mongols , though a unit of turkish defenders held the city 's citadel for another twelve days .
the city leaders opened the gates to the mongols , though a unit of turkish defenders held the city 's citadel for another twelve days .
survivors from the citadel were executed , artisans and craftsmen were sent back to mongolia , young men who had not fought were drafted into the mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery .
genghis khan had the city 's surviving population assemble in the main mosque of the town , where he declared that he was the flail of god , sent to punish them for their sins .
survivors from the citadel were executed , artisans and craftsmen were sent back to mongolia , young men who had not fought were drafted into the mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery .
after the defeat of the khwarezmian empire in 1220 , genghis khan gathered his forces in persia and armenia to return to the mongolian steppes .
under the suggestion of subutai , the mongol army was split into two forces .
the mongols destroyed the kingdom of georgia , sacked the genoese trade-fortress of caffa in crimea and overwintered near the black sea .
at the battle of kalka river in 1223 , subutai 's forces defeated the larger kievan force .
heading home , subutai 's forces attacked the allied forces of the cuman–kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 kievan rus ' troops led by mstislav the bold of halych and mstislav iii of kiev who went out to stop the mongols ' actions in the area .
later under genghis khan 's grandson batu and the golden horde , the mongols returned to conquer volga bulgaria and kievan rus ' in 1237 , concluding the campaign in 1240 .
later under genghis khan 's grandson batu and the golden horde , the mongols returned to conquer volga bulgaria and kievan rus ' in 1237 , concluding the campaign in 1240 .
the famous cavalry expedition led by subutai and jebe , in which they encircled the entire caspian sea defeating all armies in their path , remains unparalleled to this day , and word of the mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations , particularly europe .
in 1225 both divisions returned to mongolia .
genghis khan recalled subutai back to mongolia soon afterwards , and jebe died on the road back to samarkand .
in 1226 , immediately after returning from the west , genghis khan began a retaliatory attack on the tanguts .
his armies quickly took heisui , ganzhou , and suzhou ( not the suzhou in jiangsu province ) , and in the autumn he took xiliang-fu [ disambiguation needed ] .
one of the tangut generals challenged the mongols to a battle near helan mountains but was defeated .
in november , genghis laid siege to the tangut city lingzhou and crossed the yellow river , defeating the tangut relief army .
according to legend , it was here that genghis khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory .
in 1227 , genghis khan 's army attacked and destroyed the tangut capital of ning hia and continued to advance , seizing lintiao-fu , xining province , xindu-fu , and deshun province in quick succession in the spring .
at deshun , the tangut general ma jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate .
ma jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle .
genghis khan , after conquering deshun , went to liupanshan ( qingshui county , gansu province ) to escape the severe summer .
not happy with their betrayal and resistance , genghis khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed , effectively ending the tangut lineage .
the long running paternity discussion about genghis ' oldest son jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of jochi among the brothers .
in the secret history of the mongols , just before the invasion of the khwarezmid empire by genghis khan , chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept jochi as genghis khan 's successor .
in the secret history of the mongols , just before the invasion of the khwarezmid empire by genghis khan , chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept jochi as genghis khan 's successor .
in response to this tension , and possibly for other reasons , ögedei was appointed as successor .
genghis khan was aware of the friction between his sons ( particularly between chagatai and jochi ) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died .
chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior , because of statements he made that he would not follow jochi if he were to become his father 's successor .
tolui , genghis khan 's youngest son , was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the mongol culture , youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age .
ögedei was seen by genghis khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers .
jochi died in 1226 , during his father 's lifetime .
rashid al-din reports that the great khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223 , and while his brothers heeded the order , jochi remained in khorasan .
juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between jochi and his brothers in the siege of urgench .
i would be doing a service if i killed my father when he is hunting , made an alliance with sultan muhammad , brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the muslims . "
juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that genghis khan ordered his son secretly poisoned ; however , as sultan muhammad was already dead in 1223 , the accuracy of this story is questionable .
in august 1227 , during the fall of yinchuan , the capital of western xia , genghis khan died .
according to the secret history of the mongols genghis khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury .
the galician–volhynian chronicle alleges he was killed by the western xia in battle , while marco polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign .
later mongol chronicles connect genghis ' death with a western xia princess taken as war booty .
one chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him , though some mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival oirads .
years before his death , genghis khan asked to be buried without markings , according to the customs of his tribe .
after he died , his body was returned to mongolia and presumably to his birthplace in khentii aimag , where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the onon river and the burkhan khaldun mountain ( part of the kentii mountain range ) .

the genghis khan mausoleum , constructed many years after his death , is his memorial , but not his burial site .
in 1939 chinese nationalist soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'lord 's enclosure ' ( mongolian : edsen khoroo ) in mongolia to protect it from japanese troops .
it was taken through communist-held territory in yan'an some 900 km on carts to safety at a buddhist monastery , the dongshan dafo dian , where it remained for ten years .
in 1949 , as communist troops advanced , the nationalist soldiers moved it another 200 km farther west to the famous tibetan monastery of kumbum monastery or ta'er shi near xining , which soon fell under communist control .
in early 1954 , genghis khan 's bier and relics were returned to the lord 's enclosure in mongolia .
in 1968 during the cultural revolution , red guards destroyed almost everything of value .
on october 6 , 2004 , a joint japanese-mongolian archaeological dig uncovered what is believed to be genghis khan 's palace in rural mongolia , which raises the possibility of actually locating the ruler 's long-lost burial site .
folklore says that a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find ( the same manner of burial as the sumerian king gilgamesh of uruk and atilla the hun ) .

other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses , and that trees were then planted over the site , and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site .
the mongol empire was governed by a civilian and military code , called the yassa , created by genghis khan .
the mongol empire was governed by a civilian and military code , called the yassa , created by genghis khan .
the mongol empire did not emphasize the importance of ethnicity and race in the administrative realm , instead adopting an approach grounded in meritocracy .
the exception was the role of genghis khan and his family .
many of the empire 's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves mongols in military and civilian life , including mongols , turks and others and included many diverse khans of various ethnicities as part of the mongol empire such as muhammad khan .
there were tax exemptions for religious figures and , to some extent , teachers and doctors .
[ citation needed ] sometime before the rise of genghis khan , ong khan , his mentor and eventual rival , had converted to nestorian christianity .
the mongol empire practiced religious tolerance because mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept , and not subject to law or interference .
various mongol tribes were shamanist , buddhist or christian .
women played a relatively important role in mongol empire and in family , for example töregene khatun was briefly in charge of the mongol empire when next male khagan was being chosen .
modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the pax mongolica ( mongol peace ) .
however , there is no evidence of this , or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the chinese .
modern mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life , genghis khan attempted to create a civil state under the great yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals , including women .
for this purpose genghis khan invited a khitan prince , chu'tsai , who worked for the jin and had been captured by the mongol army after the jin dynasty was defeated .
he also realised that such administrators could not be found among his mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities .
jin had captured power by displacing khitan .
genghis told chu'tsai , who was a lineal descendant of khitan rulers , that he had avenged chu'tsai 's forefathers .
genghis khan put absolute trust in his generals , such as muqali , jebe and subutai , and regarded them as close advisors , often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members .
he allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the mongol empire capital karakorum .
muqali , a trusted lieutenant , was given command of the mongol forces against the jin dynasty while genghis khan was fighting in central asia , and subutai and jebe were allowed to pursue the great raid into the caucasus and kievan rus ' , an idea they had presented to the khagan on their own initiative .

while granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions , genghis khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them .
the mongol military was also successful in siege warfare , cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers , taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army , and adopting new ideas , techniques and tools from the people they conquered , particularly in employing muslim and chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the mongol cavalry in capturing cities .

another standard tactic of the mongol military was the commonly practiced feigned retreat to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for ambush and counterattack .

the empire 's expansion continued for a generation or more after genghis 's death in 1227. under genghis 's successor ögedei khan the speed of expansion reached its peak .
mongol armies pushed into persia , finished off the western xia and the remnants of the khwarezmids , and came into conflict with the imperial song dynasty of china , starting a war that lasted until 1279 and that concluded with the mongols gaining control of all of china .
genghis khan is credited with bringing the silk road under one cohesive political environment .
in turkey , genghis khan is looked on as a great military leader , and it is popular for male children to carry his title as name .
some historians have noted that genghis khan instituted certain levels of meritocracy in his rule , was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers .
this allowed increased communication and trade between the west , middle east and asia , thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas .
in the early 1990s the memory of genghis khan with the mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the mongolian people 's republic period .
he is looked upon positively by mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes .
for example , it is not uncommon for mongolians to refer to their country as " genghis khan 's mongolia " , to themselves as " genghis khan 's children " , and to genghis khan as the " father of the mongols " especially among the younger generation .
however , there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality .
mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-mongolians are unfairly biased against genghis khan and that his butchery is exaggerated , while his positive role is underrated .
his face can be found on everyday commodities , from liquor bottles to candy products , and on the largest denominations of 500 , 1,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , and 20,000 mongolian tögrög ( ₮ ) .
in mongolia today , genghis khan 's name and likeness are endorsed on products , streets , buildings , and other places .
mongolia 's main international airport in ulaanbaatar is named chinggis khaan international airport .
there have been repeated discussions about regulating the use of his name and image to avoid trivialization .
major genghis khan statues have been erected before the parliament and near ulaanbaatar .
he is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional mongolian script and the creation of the ikh zasag ( great administration ) , the first written mongolian law .
" ikh zasag law adopted during genghis khan ’ s time in mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily , " mongolian president tsakhiagiin elbegdorj noted .

although the famous mughal emperors were proud descendants of genghis khan and particularly timur , they clearly distanced themselves from the mongol atrocities committed against the khwarizim shahs , turks , persians , the citizens of baghdad and damascus , nishapur , bukhara and historical figures such as attar of nishapur and many other notable muslims .
however , mughal emperors directly patronized the legacies of genghis khan and timur ; together their names were synonymous with the names of other distinguished personalities particularly among the muslim populations of south asia .

one theory suggests the name stems from a palatalised version of the mongolian and turkic word tenggis , meaning " ocean " , " oceanic " or " wide-spreading " .
( lake baikal and ocean were called tenggis by the mongols .

the word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries .
the pharma ( as it was referred to ) often operated through a retail shop which , in addition to ingredients for medicines , sold tobacco and patent medicines .
however , the original greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison .
often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term , though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy , in english the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent .
the pharmas also used many other herbs not listed .

in japan , at the end of the asuka period ( 538–710 ) and the early nara period ( 710–794 ) , the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected .
the place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the taihō code ( 701 ) and re-stated in the yōrō code ( 718 ) .
ranked positions in the pre-heian imperial court were established ; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the meiji restoration ( 1868 ) .
in this highly stable hierarchy , the pharmacists—and even pharmacist assistants—were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists .
in the imperial household , the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the emperor .
the advances made in the middle east in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval islam substantially to develop pharmacology .
muhammad ibn zakarīya rāzi ( rhazes ) ( 865–915 ) , for instance , acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds .
abu al-qasim al-zahrawi ( abulcasis ) ( 936–1013 ) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation .
al-muwaffaq ’ s contributions in the field are also pioneering .

in most countries , the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation ; with requirements for storage conditions , compulsory texts , equipment , etc. , specified in legislation .
where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications , there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients .

hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital .
most hospital medications are unit-dose , or a single dose of medicine .
several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding .
the high cost of medications and drug-related technology , combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety , make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible .
hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications , including more specialized medications , than would be feasible in the community setting .
pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health , wellness , and disease prevention .
clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings , but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics .
clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care .
they often participate in patient care rounds drug product selection .
clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings , but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics .
the clinical pharmacist 's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems , identifying goals of therapy , and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient .
the review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy ( e.g. , drug choice , dose , route , frequency , and duration of therapy ) and its efficacy .
the review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy ( e.g. , drug choice , dose , route , frequency , and duration of therapy ) and its efficacy .
the pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions , adverse drug reactions , and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan .
in the u.s. federal health care system ( including the va , the indian health service , and nih ) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority .
in some states such north carolina and new mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority .
in 2011 the board of pharmaceutical specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification .
the official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be board certified ambulatory care pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials bcacp .

consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review ( i.e .
consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes , but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings .
traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners , though in the united states many now work for several large pharmacy management companies ( primarily omnicare , kindred healthcare and pharmerica ) .
this trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients , primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings .
some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services .
since about the year 2000 , a growing number of internet pharmacies have been established worldwide .
many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies , and in fact , many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door .
internet pharmacies ( also known as online pharmacies ) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound .
some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take .
the primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received .
many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the " inconvenience " of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe .
however , this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous , especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications , risk/benefit ratios , and an individual 's overall suitability for use of a medication .
there also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products .
while most internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription , some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription .
while most internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription , some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription .
of particular concern with internet pharmacies is the ease with which people , youth in particular , can obtain controlled substances ( e.g. , vicodin , generically known as hydrocodone ) via the internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship .
[ citation needed ] in the united states , in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid , it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship .

while in most cases importation of prescription medications violates food and drug administration ( fda ) regulations and federal laws , enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers , rather than consumers .
there is no known case of any u.s. citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription , who has ever been charged by authorities .

pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science .
pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy , however , they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies .
as a practice area and specialist domain , pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals .
pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development , deployment and optimization .
as a practice area and specialist domain , pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals .
in addition to supplying these drugs , specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring , adherence counseling , and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs .
it is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly fda approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs .
specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable , oral , infused , or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer , hepatitis , and rheumatoid arthritis .
unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled , specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored , administered , carefully monitored , and clinically managed .
in addition to supplying these drugs , specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring , adherence counseling , and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs .
in most jurisdictions ( such as the united states ) , pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians .
these jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public , and that pharmacists can not form business partnerships with physicians or give them " kickback " payments .
however , the american medical association ( ama ) code of ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere .
7 to 10 percent of american physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own .
these jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public , and that pharmacists can not form business partnerships with physicians or give them " kickback " payments .
this law also exists in austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away , or where none is registered in the city .
in some rural areas in the united kingdom , there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices .
the law requires that the gp practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified , minimum distance ( currently 1.6 kilometres ) between a patient 's home and the nearest retail pharmacy .
this law also exists in austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away , or where none is registered in the city .
the reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers .
otherwise , the physician has a financial self-interest in " diagnosing " as many conditions as possible , and in exaggerating their seriousness , because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient .
this system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the u.s. and many other governments .
otherwise , the physician has a financial self-interest in " diagnosing " as many conditions as possible , and in exaggerating their seriousness , because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient .
such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient 's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects .
in the coming decades , pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system .
rather than simply dispensing medication , pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills .
in particular , medication therapy management ( mtm ) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients .
such services include the thorough analysis of all medication ( prescription , non-prescription , and herbals ) currently being taken by an individual .
the result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system .
in canada , pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights ( as in alberta and british columbia ) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews ( medschecks in ontario ) .
this shift has already commenced in some countries ; for instance , pharmacists in australia receive remuneration from the australian government for conducting comprehensive home medicines reviews .
they are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews .
in the united states , pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy .
moreover , the doctor of pharmacy ( pharm . d. ) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation .
the two symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy in english-speaking countries are the mortar and pestle and the ℞ ( recipere ) character , which is often written as " rx " in typed text .
the show globe was also used until the early 20th century .
pharmacy organizations often use other symbols , such as the bowl of hygieia which is often used in the netherlands , conical measures , and caduceuses in their logos .
other symbols are common in different countries : the green greek cross in france , argentina , the united kingdom , belgium , ireland , italy , spain , and india , the increasingly rare gaper in the netherlands , and a red stylized letter a in germany and austria ( from apotheke , the german word for pharmacy , from the same greek root as the english word 'apothecary ' ) .

the immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease .
to function properly , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , known as pathogens , from viruses to parasitic worms , and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue .
in many species , the immune system can be classified into subsystems , such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system , or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity .
in humans , the blood–brain barrier , blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier , and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain .

pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system ; however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens .
even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections .
other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and invertebrates .
adaptive ( or acquired ) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen .
even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections .
these mechanisms include phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides called defensins , and the complement system .
this process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination .

disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and cancer .
immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal , resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections .

in humans , immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency , acquired conditions such as hiv/aids , or the use of immunosuppressive medication .
common autoimmune diseases include hashimoto 's thyroiditis , rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes mellitus type 1 , and systemic lupus erythematosus .

the earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of athens in 430 bc .
in the 18th century , pierre-louis moreau de maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom .
this and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by louis pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease .
viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 , with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by walter reed .
it was not until robert koch 's 1891 proofs , for which he was awarded a nobel prize in 1905 , that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease .

this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered .
if a pathogen breaches these barriers , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non-specific response .
if pathogens successfully evade the innate response , vertebrates possess a second layer of protection , the adaptive immune system , which is activated by the innate response .
innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals .

this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered .
in simple terms , physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism .
both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules .
in immunology , self molecules are those components of an organism 's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system .
conversely , non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules .
one class of non-self molecules are called antigens ( short for antibody generators ) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response .
one class of non-self molecules are called antigens ( short for antibody generators ) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response .
the innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors , which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms , or when damaged , injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals , many of which ( but not all ) are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens .
the innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms .

innate immune defenses are non-specific , meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way .
the waxy cuticle of many leaves , the exoskeleton of insects , the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs , and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection .

in the lungs , coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract .
the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens , while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms .

the skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β-defensins .
enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase a2 in saliva , tears , and breast milk are also antibacterials .
vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens .
in the stomach , gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens .
vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens .
within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts , commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and , in some cases , by changing the conditions in their environment , such as ph or available iron .
however , since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi , oral antibiotics can lead to an " overgrowth " of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis ( a yeast infection ) .
there is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora , such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt , helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis , inflammatory bowel diseases , urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections .
within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts , commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and , in some cases , by changing the conditions in their environment , such as ph or available iron .
inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection .
the symptoms of inflammation are redness , swelling , heat , and pain , which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue .
inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines , which are released by injured or infected cells .
eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation , and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells ( leukocytes ) .
common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells ; chemokines that promote chemotaxis ; and interferons that have anti-viral effects , such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell .
phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes ' that engulf , or eat , pathogens or particles .
phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens , but can be called to specific locations by cytokines .
once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte , it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome , which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome .
the pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome .
phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients , but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism .
neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens .
neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes .
neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes .
during the acute phase of inflammation , particularly as a result of bacterial infection , neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection .
macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1. macrophages also act as scavengers , ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris , and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system .
leukocytes ( white blood cells ) act like independent , single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system .
leukocytes ( white blood cells ) act like independent , single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system .
innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system .
the innate leukocytes include the phagocytes ( macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells ) , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils , and natural killer cells .
dendritic cells ( dc ) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment ; therefore , they are located mainly in the skin , nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines .
they are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites , as both have many spine-like projections , but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system .
dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems , as they present antigens to t cells , one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system .

rather , nk cells destroy compromised host cells , such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells , recognizing such cells by a condition known as " missing self . "
natural killer cells , or nk cells , are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes .
this term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called mhc i ( major histocompatibility complex ) – a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells .
those mhc antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors ( kir ) which essentially put the brakes on nk cells .
the adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory , where each pathogen is " remembered " by a signature antigen .
the adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific " non-self " antigens during a process called antigen presentation .
antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells .
there are two major subtypes of t cells : the killer t cell and the helper t cell .
in addition there are regulatory t cells which have a role in modulating immune response .
killer t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class i mhc molecules , while helper t cells and regulatory t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class ii mhc molecules .
killer t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class i mhc molecules , while helper t cells and regulatory t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class ii mhc molecules .
a third , minor subtype are the γδ t cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to mhc receptors .
killer t cells are a sub-group of t cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses ( and other pathogens ) , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional .
recognition of this mhc : antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the t cell , called cd8 .
killer t cells are activated when their t cell receptor ( tcr ) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the mhc class i receptor of another cell .
the entry of another toxin called granulysin ( a protease ) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis .
when an activated t cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter .
the mhc : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's cd4 co-receptor , which recruits molecules inside the t cell ( e.g. , lck ) that are responsible for the t cell 's activation .
helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc : antigen complex than observed for killer t cells , meaning many receptors ( around 200–300 ) on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc : antigen molecule .
helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc : antigen complex than observed for killer t cells , meaning many receptors ( around 200–300 ) on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc : antigen molecule .
the activation of a resting helper t cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types .
in addition , helper t cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the t cell 's surface , such as cd40 ligand ( also called cd154 ) , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing b cells .
gamma delta t cells ( γδ t cells ) possess an alternative t cell receptor ( tcr ) as opposed to cd4+ and cd8+ ( αβ ) t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells , cytotoxic t cells and nk cells .
gamma delta t cells ( γδ t cells ) possess an alternative t cell receptor ( tcr ) as opposed to cd4+ and cd8+ ( αβ ) t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells , cytotoxic t cells and nk cells .
like other 'unconventional ' t cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs , such as cd1d-restricted natural killer t cells , γδ t cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity .
on one hand , γδ t cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange tcr genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype .
for example , large numbers of human vγ9/vδ2 t cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes , and highly restricted vδ1+ t cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells .
a b cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen .
this antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the b cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides .
this combination of mhc and antigen attracts a matching helper t cell , which releases lymphokines and activates the b cell .
when b cells and t cells are activated and begin to replicate , some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells .
this is " adaptive " because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges .
immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory .
throughout the lifetime of an animal , these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again .
newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection .
during pregnancy , a particular type of antibody , called igg , is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta , so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth , with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother .
breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies .
this passive immunity is usually short-term , lasting from a few days up to several months .
hormones can act as immunomodulators , altering the sensitivity of the immune system .
for example , female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses .
some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially , and their onset often coincides with puberty .
by contrast , male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive .
additionally , proteins such as nfil3 , which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both t-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms , can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation , shift work , etc .
as a result , these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease , chronic pain , and asthma .
when suffering from sleep deprivation , active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production , and a lower immune response , than would be noted in a well-rested individual .
it is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals .
second , as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin d .
conversely , some hormones are regulated by the immune system , notably thyroid hormone activity .
this means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via uvb radiation .
the main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer t cells , sometimes with the assistance of helper t cells .
nk cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer mhc class i molecules on their surface than normal ; this is a common phenomenon with tumors .
tumor antigens are presented on mhc class i molecules in a similar way to viral antigens .
sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system .
unlike animals , plants lack phagocytic cells , but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant .
individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pamps .
when a part of a plant becomes infected , the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response , whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant .
systemic acquired resistance ( sar ) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent .
rna silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication .
overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction , particularly the autoimmune disorders .
here , the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self , and attacks part of the body .
one of the functions of specialized cells ( located in the thymus and bone marrow ) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens , preventing autoimmunity .
under normal circumstances , many t cells and antibodies react with " self " peptides .
immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive .
the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence .
the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence .
in developed countries , obesity , alcoholism , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function .
however , malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries .
active immunity can also be generated artificially , through vaccination .
the principle behind vaccination ( also called immunization ) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism .
the principle behind vaccination ( also called immunization ) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism .
this deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system , as well as its inducibility .
bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier , for example , by using a type ii secretion system .
alternatively , using a type iii secretion system , they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell , providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host .
these proteins are often used to shut down host defenses .
the success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses .
in the mid-1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory ( cst ) of immunity .
on the basis of cst , burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction : " self " constituents ( constituents of the body ) do not trigger destructive immune responses , while " nonself " entities ( pathogens , an allograft ) trigger a destructive immune response .
the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex " two-signal " activation of t cells .
in the mid-1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory ( cst ) of immunity .
glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs ; however , these drugs can have many undesirable side effects , such as central obesity , hyperglycemia , osteoporosis , and their use must be tightly controlled .
lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine .
lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine .
immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent t cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways .
in contrast , during wake periods differentiated effector cells , such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and ctls ( cytotoxic t lymphocytes ) , peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens .
as well during awake active times , anti-inflammatory molecules , such as cortisol and catecholamines , peak .
second , inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin .
inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time .
when a t-cell encounters a foreign pathogen , it extends a vitamin d receptor .
this is essentially a signaling device that allows the t-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin d , the steroid hormone calcitriol .
t-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin d. not only does the t-cell extend a vitamin d receptor , in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin d , calcitriol , but the t-cell expresses the gene cyp27b1 , which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin d , calcidiol into the steroid hormone version , calcitriol .

other immune system cells that are known to express cyp27b1 and thus activate vitamin d calcidiol , are dendritic cells , keratinocytes and macrophages .
pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens .
antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants , and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity .
the complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life .
ribonucleases and the rna interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes , and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses .
many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system ( e.g. , immunoglobulins and t cell receptors ) exist only in jawed vertebrates .
however , a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates , such as the lamprey and hagfish .
these animals possess a large array of molecules called variable lymphocyte receptors ( vlrs ) that , like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates , are produced from only a small number ( one or two ) of genes .
evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates .
it is likely that a multicomponent , adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates , as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response .
immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life , with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism , called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens , called bacteriophages .
immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life , with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism , called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens , called bacteriophages .
prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity , through a system that uses crispr sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past , which allows them to block virus replication through a form of rna interference .
the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between " cellular " and " humoral " theories of immunity .
according to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by elie metchnikoff , it was cells – more precisely , phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses .

in contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held , among others , by robert koch and emil von behring , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components ( molecules ) found in the organism ’ s “ humors ” rather than its cells .

clearly , some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers .
tumor cells often have a reduced number of mhc class i molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection by killer t cells .
some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response ; for example by secreting the cytokine tgf-β , which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes .

hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body 's own tissues .
they are divided into four classes ( type i – iv ) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction .
type i hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , often associated with allergy .
type i hypersensitivity is mediated by ige , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen .
type ii hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient 's own cells , marking them for destruction .
an evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host ( also called intracellular pathogenesis ) .
some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria ( plasmodium falciparum ) and leishmaniasis ( leishmania spp . ) .
some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria ( plasmodium falciparum ) and leishmaniasis ( leishmania spp . ) .
other bacteria , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis , live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement .
other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies , rendering them ineffective ; examples include streptococcus ( protein g ) , staphylococcus aureus ( protein a ) , and peptostreptococcus magnus ( protein l ) .
this is called antigenic variation .
an example is hiv , which mutates rapidly , so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing .
the parasite trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy , constantly switching one type of surface protein for another , allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response .
masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system .
this is called immune surveillance .
the antigens expressed by tumors have several sources ; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus , which causes cervical cancer , while others are the organism 's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells .
one example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that , when expressed at high levels , transforms certain skin cells ( e.g .
melanocytes ) into tumors called melanomas .
melanocytes ) into tumors called melanomas .
larger drugs ( > 500 da ) can provoke a neutralizing immune response , particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly , or in larger doses .
early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids ; however , more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes , usually on well-studied virus proteins , as a training set .
immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins ( proteomics ) involved in the immune response .
a publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by b cells .
the emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics .
first , during the early slow-wave-sleep stage , a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol , epinephrine , and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin .
in addition to these effects , the milieu of hormones produced at this time ( leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin ) support the interactions between apcs and t-cells , a shift of the th1/th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports th1 , an increase in overall th cell proliferation , and naïve t cell migration to lymph nodes .

this milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of th1 immune responses .
in humans , this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes .
this deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane .
the speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules , which are also proteases .
this produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback .

following the peterloo massacre of 1819 , poet percy shelley wrote the political poem the mask of anarchy later that year , that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action .
it is perhaps the first modern [ vague ] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest .
gandhi 's satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by shelley 's nonviolence in protest and political action .
in particular , it is known that gandhi would often quote shelley 's masque of anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free india .
a version was taken up by the author henry david thoreau in his essay civil disobedience , and later by gandhi in his doctrine of satyagraha .

brownlee notes that " although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue , nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table . "
in this way , they might be considered coercive .
some forms of civil disobedience , such as illegal boycotts , refusals to pay taxes , draft dodging , distributed denial-of-service attacks , and sit-ins , make it more difficult for a system to function .

many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases .
for example , the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property , and whether or not to talk to police officers .
it is generally agreed within the legal community , and is often believed within the activist community , that a suspect 's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose , and may be harmful .
however , some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators ' questions , sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications , or due to a fear of seeming rude .
also , some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers .
some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract , which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established , or else suffer the penalties set out in the law .

other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still do n't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government , or do n't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted .
and still other civil disobedients , being anarchists , do n't believe in the legitimacy of any government , and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others .

an important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty .
there is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law .

one defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power , when asked to enter his plea , stated , " i plead for the beauty that surrounds us " ; this is known as a " creative plea , " and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty .

at a pre-arranged announced time , one at a time they stepped across the " line " and were immediately arrested .
a well known civil rights attorney , francis heisler , had volunteered to defend the arrested persons , advising them to plead " nolo contendere " , as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty .
the arrested persons were found " guilty , " nevertheless , and given suspended sentences , conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds .
howard zinn writes , " there may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice .
howard zinn writes , " there may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice .
the key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , whether it is done by remaining in jail , or by evading it .
to accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules ' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest ... in particular , the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated . "
sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients , as in the case of the camden 28 , in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time .

some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials .
steven barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty , " they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine , or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience .

during the vietnam war era , the chicago eight used a political defense , while benjamin spock used a technical defense .
over the years , this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as sparf v. united states , which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative , and united states v. dougherty , which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification .
one theory is that , while disobedience may be helpful , any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit .

it has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification , as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law , is not civil disobedience .
likewise , a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution , or by denying having committed the crime , or by fleeing the jurisdiction , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient .

during the vietnam war , courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the vietnam war ; the courts ruled it was a political question .
likewise , when carter wentworth was charged for his role in the clamshell alliance 's 1977 illegal occupation of the seabrook station nuclear power plant , the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense , and he was found guilty .
fully informed jury association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to ; according to fija , many of them have escaped prosecution because " prosecutors have reasoned ( correctly ) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters , the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter 's own jury as evidence . "
along with giving the offender his " just deserts " , achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment .
leonard hubert hoffmann writes , " in deciding whether or not to impose punishment , the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good .
it is a matter for the state ( including the judges ) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not . "
brownlee argues , " bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law ’ s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law . "
construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure .
construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client .
construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries .
construction starts with planning , [ citation needed ] design , and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use .
construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client .
an architect normally manages the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or project manager supervises it .
an architect normally manages the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or project manager supervises it .
for the successful execution of a project , effective planning is essential .
the largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects .
those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements , the environmental impact of the job , the successful scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding , etc .
in general , there are three sectors of construction : buildings , infrastructure and industrial .
building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential ( commercial/institutional ) .
infrastructure is often called heavy/highway , heavy civil or heavy engineering .
infrastructure is often called heavy/highway , heavy civil or heavy engineering .
industrial includes refineries , process chemical , power generation , mills and manufacturing plants .
engineering news-record ( enr ) is a trade magazine for the construction industry .
each year , enr compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies .
in 2014 , enr compiled the data in nine market segments .
in their reporting on the top 400 , they used data on transportation , sewer , hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors .
to recognize the differences of companies in this sector , it is divided into three subsectors : building construction , heavy and civil engineering construction , and specialty trade contractors .
there are also categories for construction service firms ( e.g. , engineering , architecture ) and construction managers ( firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project ) .
the standard industrial classification and the newer north american industry classification system have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction .
there are also categories for construction service firms ( e.g. , engineering , architecture ) and construction managers ( firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project ) .
building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings .
the majority of building construction jobs are small renovations , such as addition of a room , or renovation of a bathroom .
often , the owner of the property acts as laborer , paymaster , and design team for the entire project .
although building construction projects typically include various common elements , such as design , financial , estimating and legal considerations , many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results , such as structural collapse , cost overruns , and/or litigation .
for this reason , those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome .
residential construction practices , technologies , and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice .
materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used ( e.g .
as residential construction ( as well as all other types of construction ) can generate a lot of waste , careful planning again is needed here .
cost of construction on a per square meter ( or per square foot ) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions , local regulations , economies of scale ( custom designed homes are often more expensive to build ) and the availability of skilled tradespeople .
new techniques of building construction are being researched , made possible by advances in 3d printing technology .
in a form of additive building construction , similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts , building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours , with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities , in one continuous build , using large 3d printers .
working versions of 3d-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) of building material per hour as of january 2013 [ update ] , with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) per hour , sufficient to complete a building in a week .

a formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings , and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts .
in the modern industrialized world , construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality .
in contract with ) the property owner .
under this system , once the design is completed by the design team , a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work , either based directly on the design , or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor .
following evaluation of bids , the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder .
the modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties , especially among large firms .
in the past , architects , interior designers , engineers , developers , construction managers , and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies , even in the larger firms .
thus , each such firm may offer itself as " one-stop shopping " for a construction project , from beginning to end .
this is designated as a " design build " contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction , while adhering to the performance specifications .
several project structures can assist the owner in this integration , including design-build , partnering and construction management .
in general , each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects , interior designers , engineers and constructors throughout design and construction .
in response , many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process .
construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems .
underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project .
cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding can not cover the current costs for labour and materials , and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time , can arise even when the overall total is enough .
fraud is a problem in many fields , but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field .
mortgage bankers , accountants , and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project .
the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely , even in relatively small projects since the owner 's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project .
accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process .
cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs , which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid .
cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation .
the project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements .
constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner .
some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations , or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions .
other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations , or things that are a matter of custom or expectation , such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district .
an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built , either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable ( the bridge design will not cause a collapse ) , or that the custom is no longer needed ( acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community ) .
a construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations , each of which all parties must carefully consider .
a contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties , but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible .
the time element in construction means that a delay costs money , and in cases of bottlenecks , the delay can be extremely expensive .
thus , the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out .
contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly , whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse .
there is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project .
new forms include partnering such as public-private partnering ( ppps ) aka private finance initiatives ( pfis ) and alliances such as " pure " or " project " alliances and " impure " or " strategic " alliances .

the focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry .

the procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy .
the owner produces a list of requirements for a project , giving an overall view of the project 's goals .
several d & b contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals .
the owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor .
often , it is not just one contractor , but a consortium of several contractors working together .
as they build phase 1 , they design phase 2. this is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract , where the project is completely designed by the owner , then bid on , then completed .
before the foundation can be dug , contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked , either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services .
this lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical , water , sewage , phone , and cable facilities , which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations .

during the construction of a building , the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code .
once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed , an occupancy permit may be issued .

some construction workers in the us/canada have made more than $ 100,000 annually , depending on their trade .
construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world , incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the united states and in the european union .
falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers .
other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution , transportation accidents , and trench cave-ins .
proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry .
private schools , also known as independent schools , non-governmental , or nonstate schools , are not administered by local , state or national governments ; thus , they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition , rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public ( government ) funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , which makes the cost cheaper , depending on a talent the student may have ( e.g .
sport scholarship , art scholarship , academic scholarship ) , financial need , or tax credit scholarships that might be available .

in the united kingdom and several other commonwealth countries including australia and canada , the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels ; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions .
private education in north america covers the whole gamut of educational activity , ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions .
the secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 ( year twelve is known as lower sixth ) and year 13 ( upper sixth ) .
the secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 ( year twelve is known as lower sixth ) and year 13 ( upper sixth ) .
this category includes university-preparatory schools or " prep schools " , boarding schools and day schools .
tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors , including the location of the school , the willingness of parents to pay , peer tuitions and the school 's financial endowment .
high tuition , schools claim , is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments , including a low student to teacher ratio , small class sizes and services , such as libraries , science laboratories and computers .
they include parochial schools , a term which is often used to denote roman catholic schools .
other religious groups represented in the k-12 private education sector include protestants , jews , muslims and the orthodox christians .
some such schools teach religious education , together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faith 's beliefs and traditions in the students who attend .
some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education ; the presence of boarding facilities ; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion , a tool not readily available to government schools .
student uniforms for australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example , a compulsory blazer .
private schools in australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts .
although most are non-aligned , some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large , long-established religious foundations , such as the anglican church , uniting church and presbyterian church , but in most cases , they do not insist on their students ’ religious allegiance .
they are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style , some catholic schools fall into this category as well , e.g .

the right to create private schools in germany is in article 7 , paragraph 4 of the grundgesetz and can not be suspended even in a state of emergency .
this unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second gleichschaltung or similar event in the future .
overall , between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in germany increased from 6.1 % to 7.8 % ( including rise from 0.5 % to 6.1 % in the former gdr ) .

teachers at ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools , an ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and article 7 , paragraph 4 of the grundgesetz , also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents ( the so-called sonderungsverbot ) .
ersatzschulen are ordinary primary or secondary schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or religious groups .
therefore , most ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships , compared to most other western european countries .
ergänzungsschulen are secondary or post-secondary ( non-tertiary ) schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or rarely , religious groups and offer a type of education which is not available at public schools .

in india , private schools are called independent schools , but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government , it can be an aided or an unaided school .
prominent examination boards that are present in multiple states are the cbse and the cisce , nenbse
among other things , this has also resulted in 30 different examination boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates .
the practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector .

in 1846 , the natural history lectures of louis agassiz were acclaimed both in new york and on the campus at harvard college .
agassiz 's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the " divine plan " in all phenomena .
this dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of common sense realism derived from scottish philosophers thomas reid and dugald stewart , whose works were part of the harvard curriculum at the time .
charles w. eliot , president 1869–1909 , eliminated the favored position of christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction .
while eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of american higher education , he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education , but by transcendentalist unitarian convictions .
derived from william ellery channing and ralph waldo emerson , these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature , the right and ability of each person to perceive truth , and the indwelling god in each person .
james bryant conant ( president , 1933–1953 ) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions .
he saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy , so conant devised programs to identify , recruit , and support talented youth .

neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor , capital and land .
within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers .

where professional and labor organizations can not limit the number of workers ) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , or by the employer , but rather by the market .
under the law of supply and demand , the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker .
employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed .
their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor .
" markets , by themselves , even when they are stable , often lead to high levels of inequality , outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair . "
where professional and labor organizations can not limit the number of workers ) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , or by the employer , but rather by the market .
wages work in the same way as prices for any other good .
thus , wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill .
" on the other hand , markets can also concentrate wealth , pass environmental costs on to society , and abuse workers and consumers . "
" markets , by themselves , even when they are stable , often lead to high levels of inequality , outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair . "
competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job .
a job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time ( high supply ) competing for a job that few require ( low demand ) will result in a low wage for that job .
a job where there are few able or willing workers ( low supply ) , but a large need for the positions ( high demand ) , will result in high wages for that job .
members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining , political influence , or corruption .
professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members .
a job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time ( high supply ) competing for a job that few require ( low demand ) will result in a low wage for that job .
this is because competition between workers drives down the wage .

a job where there are few able or willing workers ( low supply ) , but a large need for the positions ( high demand ) , will result in high wages for that job .
competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job , since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position .
on the other hand , higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level ( self-employment ) .
necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter ( " push " motivations ) , whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations ( " pull " ) such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products , services , or underserved market needs .

the economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth .
a progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases .
in a progressive tax system , the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society , either increasing it or decreasing it , provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime .
additionally , steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board .
another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system .

the difference between the gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation .
an important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals ' access to education .

as a result , those who are unable to afford an education , or choose not to pursue optional education , generally receive much lower wages .
conversely , education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor .
the justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes , and thus lower aggregate savings and investment .

economist joseph stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , which may better be explained by the non-market force known as " rent-seeking " .
economist joseph stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , which may better be explained by the non-market force known as " rent-seeking " .
while the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation , greater productivity , etc. , it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices , profits and large compensation .
a better explainer of growing inequality , according to stiglitz , is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them .
this process , known to economists as rent-seeking , brings income not from creation of wealth but from " grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort "
effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems , and lower rates of social goods , a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption , and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption .

high and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth .
unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict .
policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth .
british researchers richard g. wilkinson and kate pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems ( obesity , mental illness , homicides , teenage births , incarceration , child conflict , drug use ) , and lower rates of social goods ( life expectancy by country , educational performance , trust among strangers , women 's status , social mobility , even numbers of patents issued ) in countries and states with higher inequality .

for most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs , access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives .
this pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries , where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases , but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world .

the unicef index of " child well-being in rich countries " , studying 40 indicators in 22 countries , correlates with greater equality but not per capita income .
crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society .
most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions .
there have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger .
they estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state .
2001 found that among u.s states and canadian provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality .
following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic .
a house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five , is an example of reduced " distributive efficiency " within society , that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility .
an additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person , such as basic necessities like food , water , and healthcare ; while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person .
thus , the marginal utility of wealth per person ( " the additional dollar " ) decreases as a person becomes richer .
from this standpoint , for any given amount of wealth in society , a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility .
conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption , rather than income should be the measure of inequality , and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the us .
will wilkinson of the libertarian cato institute states that " the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality , " and consumption is more important than income .
according to johnson , smeeding , and tory , consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986. the debate is summarized in " the hidden prosperity of the poor " by journalist thomas b. edsall .

according to international monetary fund economists , inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells ( not the rate of growth ) .
high levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity , but also the quality of a country 's institutions and high levels of education .
according to imf staff economists , " if the income share of the top 20 percent ( the rich ) increases , then gdp growth actually declines over the medium term , suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down .
in contrast , an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent ( the poor ) is associated with higher gdp growth .

a 1996 study by perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth .
he found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation , which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment .
also , very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable , which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth . "

a study of swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less , but no correlation after ten years .
studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the kuznets curve hypothesis , which states that with economic development , inequality first increases , then decreases .

economist thomas piketty challenges this notion , claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and " violent economic and political shocks " reduced inequality .
some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development .
according to a 1955 review , savings by the wealthy , if these increase with inequality , were thought to offset reduced consumer demand .
a 2013 report on nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality .
analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth .
developing countries with high inequality have " succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years " but " longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution . "
while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development , poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth .
the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality .
for instance , with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 % per head and 40 % of its population living in poverty , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction .
in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban ki-moon : " while economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty . "

in many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system .
much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements .
reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building , in some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land .

a number of researchers ( david rodda , jacob vigdor , and janna matlack ) , argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the us – is caused in part by income inequality .
david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased ( rhoda 1994:148 ) .
david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased ( rhoda 1994:148 ) .
through gentrification of older neighbourhoods , for example , in east new york , rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units .
the ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace .
firstly , certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone , such as the costs of housing , pensions , education and health care .
if the state does not provide these services , then for those on lower incomes , the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances .
secondly , aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt .

the result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability .
the smaller the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , resulting in many cases , in more environmental degradation .
[ not in citation given ] it should be noted here however that in certain cases , with great economic inequality , there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards ( water treatment , filtering , ... ) ... . also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier .

as such , the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well . if ( as wwf argued ) , population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level ( 1/3 of current levels , so about 2 billion people ) , human inequality can be addressed/corrected , while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage .
socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners , creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment , financial assets and corporate stock .

by contrast , the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary .
in order to rectify this situation , socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product .

robert nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force ( usually in the form of taxation ) , and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force .
however , nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property , and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves .
john rawls argued in a theory of justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole , including the poorest members .
the capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “ capability deprivation ” .
unlike neoliberalism , which “ defines well-being as utility maximization ” , economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself .
its goal is to “ wid [ en ] people ’ s choices and the level of their achieved well-being ” through increasing functionings ( the things a person values doing ) , capabilities ( the freedom to enjoy functionings ) and agency ( the ability to pursue valued goals ) .

when a person ’ s capabilities are lowered , they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise .
an old , ill man can not earn as much as a healthy young man ; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home .

there may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic , or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives .
to prevent such inequality , this approach believes it ’ s important to have political freedom , economic facilities , social opportunities , transparency guarantees , and protective security to ensure that people aren ’ t denied their functionings , capabilities , and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income .

although the mongols had ruled territories including today 's north china for decades , it was not until 1271 that kublai khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional chinese style .
the yuan dynasty is considered both a successor to the mongol empire and an imperial chinese dynasty .
in official chinese histories , the yuan dynasty bore the mandate of heaven , following the song dynasty and preceding the ming dynasty .

the dynasty was established by kublai khan , yet he placed his grandfather genghis khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as taizu .
in 1271 , kublai khan imposed the name great yuan ( chinese : 大元 ; pinyin : dà yuán ; wade–giles : ta-yüan ) , establishing the yuan dynasty .
" dà yuán " ( 大元 ) is from the sentence " 大哉乾元 " ( dà zai qián yuán / " great is qián , the primal " ) in the commentaries on the classic of changes ( i ching ) section regarding qián ( 乾 ) .
the counterpart in mongolian language was dai ön ulus , also rendered as ikh yuan üls or yekhe yuan ulus .
" great mongol state " ) , resulting in dai ön yeke mongghul ulus ( mongolian script : ) , meaning " great yuan great mongol state " .
furthermore , the yuan is sometimes known as the " empire of the great khan " or " khanate of the great khan " , which particularly appeared on some yuan maps , since yuan emperors held the nominal title of great khan .

li tan , the son-in-law of a powerful official , instigated a revolt against mongol rule in 1262. after successfully suppressing the revolt , kublai curbed the influence of the han chinese advisers in his court .
kublai 's government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving mongol interests in china and satisfying the demands of his chinese subjects .
he restored the imperial secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past chinese dynasties unchanged .
however , kublai rejected plans to revive the confucian imperial examinations and divided yuan society into three , later four , classes with the han chinese occupying the lowest rank .

the fourth yuan emperor , buyantu khan ( ayurbarwada ) , was a competent emperor .
he was the first yuan emperor to actively support and adopt mainstream chinese culture after the reign of kublai , to the discontent of some mongol elite .
he had been mentored by li meng , a confucian academic .
he made many reforms , including the liquidation of the department of state affairs ( chinese : 尚書省 ) , which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials .
starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials , testing their knowledge on significant historical works .
emperor gegeen khan , ayurbarwada 's son and successor , ruled for only two years , from 1321 to 1323. he continued his father 's policies to reform the government based on the confucian principles , with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor baiju .

during his reign , the da yuan tong zhi ( chinese : 大元通制 , " the comprehensive institutions of the great yuan " ) , a huge collection of codes and regulations of the yuan dynasty begun by his father , was formally promulgated .
gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction , perhaps steppe elite opposed to confucian reforms .
when yesün temür died in shangdu in 1328 , tugh temür was recalled to khanbaliq by the qipchaq commander el temür .
gaining support from princes and officers in northern china and some other parts of the dynasty , khanbaliq-based tugh temür eventually won the civil war against ragibagh known as the war of the two capitals .
however , kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with tugh temür .
he was supposedly killed with poison by el temür , and tugh temür then remounted the throne .
he was supposedly killed with poison by el temür , and tugh temür then remounted the throne .
due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by el temür , tugh temür is known for his cultural contribution instead .
his most concrete effort to patronize chinese learning was founding the academy of the pavilion of the star of literature ( chinese : 奎章閣學士院 ) , first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake " a number of tasks relating to the transmission of confucian high culture to the mongolian imperial establishment " .

the academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books , but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named jingshi dadian ( chinese : 經世大典 ) .
tugh temür supported zhu xi 's neo-confucianism and also devoted himself in buddhism .
after the death of tugh temür in 1332 and subsequent death of rinchinbal ( emperor ningzong ) the same year , the 13-year-old toghun temür ( emperor huizong ) , the last of the nine successors of kublai khan , was summoned back from guangxi and succeeded to the throne .

one of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the liao , jin , and song dynasties , which were eventually completed in 1345. yet , toghtogha resigned his office with the approval of toghun temür , marking the end of his first administration , and he was not called back until 1349 .
the final years of the yuan dynasty were marked by struggle , famine , and bitterness among the populace .
in time , kublai khan 's successors lost all influence on other mongol lands across asia , while the mongols beyond the middle kingdom saw them as too chinese .
uninterested in administration , they were separated from both the army and the populace , and china was torn by dissension and unrest .
outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening yuan armies .
uninterested in administration , they were separated from both the army and the populace , and china was torn by dissension and unrest .
from the late 1340s onwards , people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts , floods and the resulting famines , and the government 's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support .
in 1351 , the red turban rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising .
in 1354 , when toghtogha led a large army to crush the red turban rebels , toghun temür suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal .

he fled north to shangdu from khanbaliq ( present-day beijing ) in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the míng dynasty ( 1368–1644 ) , founded by zhu yuanzhang in the south .
the political unity of china and much of central asia promoted trade between east and west .
the mongols ' extensive west asian and european contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange .
it had significantly eased trade and commerce across asia until its decline ; the communications between yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in persia , the ilkhanate , encouraged this development .
eastern crops such as carrots , turnips , new varieties of lemons , eggplants , and melons , high-quality granulated sugar , and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the yuan dynasty .
western musical instruments were introduced to enrich chinese performing arts .
nestorianism and roman catholicism also enjoyed a period of toleration .
buddhism ( especially tibetan buddhism ) flourished , although taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of buddhism from the yuan government .
confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the classics , which had fallen into disuse in north china during the period of disunity , were reinstated by the yuan court , probably in the hope of maintaining order over han society .
advances were realized in the fields of travel literature , cartography , geography , and scientific education .
the most famous traveler of the period was the venetian marco polo , whose account of his trip to " cambaluc , " the capital of the great khan , and of life there astounded the people of europe .
the most famous traveler of the period was the venetian marco polo , whose account of his trip to " cambaluc , " the capital of the great khan , and of life there astounded the people of europe .
the account of his travels , il milione ( or , the million , known in english as the travels of marco polo ) , appeared about the year 1299. some argue over the accuracy of marco polo 's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the great wall of china , tea houses , which would have been a prominent sight since europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture , as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the great khan .

some suggest that marco polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with persian traders since many of the places he named were in persian .
among kublai khan 's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer guo shoujing , who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year , which was only 26 seconds off the modern gregorian calendar 's measurement .

to provide against possible famines , granaries were ordered built throughout the empire .
during the yuan period , beijing became the terminus of the grand canal of china , which was completely renovated .
contacts with the west also brought the introduction to china of a major food crop , sorghum , along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation .
the yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native chinese people ruled all of china .
mongols are widely known to worship the eternal heaven , and according to the traditional mongolian ideology yuan is considered to be " the beginning of an infinite number of beings , the foundation of peace and happiness , state power , the dream of many peoples , besides it there is nothing great or precious . "
in traditional historiography of china , on the other hand , the yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the song dynasty and the ming dynasty .

who did not consider the yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of china , but rather as a period of foreign domination .
the system of bureaucracy created by kublai khan reflected various cultures in the empire , including that of the han chinese , khitans , jurchens , mongols , and tibetan buddhists .
the chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native tang , song , as well as khitan liao and jurchen jin dynasties .
chinese advisers such as liu bingzhong and yao shu gave strong influence to kublai 's early court , and the central government administration was established within the first decade of kublai 's reign .
this government adopted the traditional chinese tripartite division of authority among civil , military , and censorial offices , including the central secretariat ( zhongshu sheng ) to manage civil affairs , the privy council ( chinese : 樞密院 ) to manage military affairs , and the censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection .

another example was the insignificance of the ministry of war compared with native chinese dynasties , as the real military authority in yuan times resided in the privy council .
while the existence of these central government departments and the six ministries ( which had been introduced since the sui and tang dynasties ) gave a sinicized image in the yuan administration , the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions .
for example , the authority of the yuan legal system , the ministry of justice , did not extend to legal cases involving mongols and semuren , who had separate courts of justice .

since its invention in 1269 , the 'phags-pa script , a unified script for spelling mongolian , tibetan , and chinese languages , was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty .

most of the emperors could not master written chinese , but they could generally converse well in the language .
the mongol custom of long standing quda/marriage alliance with mongol clans , the onggirat , and the ikeres , kept the imperial blood purely mongol until the reign of tugh temur , whose mother was a tangut concubine .
nevertheless , a few other yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities ; an example is tugh temur ( emperor wenzong ) , who wrote poetry , painted , read chinese classical texts , and ordered the compilation of books .
the mongols practiced debt slavery , and by 1290 in all parts of the mongol empire commoners were selling their children into slavery .
seeing this as damaging to the mongol nation , kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of mongols .
the average mongol garrison family of the yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure , with income from the harvests of their chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty .
in the china of the yuan , or mongol era , various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development , including the areas of painting , mathematics , calligraphy , poetry , and theater , with many great artists and writers being famous today .
due to the coming together of painting , poetry , and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals , though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others .
often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting , poetry , and calligraphy , the song dynasty and the yuan dynasty are linked together .
in yuan poetry , the main development was the qu , which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous yuan poets .
one of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form .
however , unlike the western khanates , the yuan dynasty never converted to islam .
instead , kublai khan , the founder of the yuan dynasty , favored buddhism , especially the tibetan variants .
as a result , tibetan buddhism was established as the de facto state religion .
the top-level department and government agency known as the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs ( xuanzheng yuan ) was set up in khanbaliq ( modern beijing ) to supervise buddhist monks throughout the empire .
since kublai khan only esteemed the sakya sect of tibetan buddhism , other religions became less important .

the production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations .
a consortium led by the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics ( icrisat ) has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties , instead of maize , in particularly dry areas .
pigeon peas are very drought resistant , so can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall .
successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes , by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing .
this work , which included linking producers to wholesalers , helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25 % in nairobi and mombasa .
the commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets , ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock , and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty .

livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east .
unfortunately , the country has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty ( 53 % of the population lives below the poverty line ) , a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid .
this was last seen in august and september 2011 prompting the kenyans for kenya initiative by the red cross .

the commission focused on identity and unity , which were critical issues at the time .
between 1964 and 1985 , the 7–4–2–3 system was adopted – seven years of primary , four years of lower secondary , two years of upper secondary , and three years of university .
in 1981 , the presidential working party on the second university was commissioned to look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system .
the committee recommended that the 7–4–2–3 system be changed to an 8–4–4 system ( eight years in primary , four years in secondary , and four years in university education ) .
the table under present-day education in kenya below shows the structure of the 8–4–4 system .
although the 7–4–2–3 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8–4–4 system in 1985 , the last batch of students from the former system graduated from kenyan universities in 1992 .
the current 8–4–4 system was launched in january 1985. it put more emphasis on vocational subjects on the assumption that the new structure would enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment in the informal sector .

even with this increase , the maximum it showed for the medieval warm period did not reach temperatures recorded in central england in 2007. the mbh99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by jones et al . 1998 , pollack , huang & shen 1998 , crowley & lowery 2000 and briffa 2000 , using differing data and methods .
these studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900 , and the mbh99 based graph featured in publicity .
even at the draft stage , this finding was disputed by contrarians : in may 2000 fred singer 's science and environmental policy project held a press event on capitol hill , washington , d.c. , featuring comments on the graph wibjörn karlén and singer argued against the graph at a united states senate committee on commerce , science and transportation hearing on 18 july 2000. contrarian john lawrence daly featured a modified version of the ipcc 1990 schematic , which he mis-identified as appearing in the ipcc 1995 report , and argued that " overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report , the ipcc presented the 'hockey stick ' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt u-turn since its 1995 report " .

over the six years studied , the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by ipcc 's 2001 projection , and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the ipcc projection .
over the six years studied , the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by ipcc 's 2001 projection , and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the ipcc projection .
another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the ipcc , far from overstating dangers and risks , have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels .
these values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report , published in 2001 " .
when the researchers ' analysis was " applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m [ 50–140 cm ] above 1990 levels .
these values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report , published in 2001 " .
michael oppenheimer , a long-time participant in the ipcc and coordinating lead author of the fifth assessment report conceded in science magazine 's state of the planet 2008-2009 some limitations of the ipcc consensus approach and asks for concurring , smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous ipcc assessment reports .

in case of the ozone depletion global regulation based on the montreal protocol has been successful , in case of climate change , the kyoto protocol failed .
in case of the ozone depletion global regulation based on the montreal protocol has been successful , in case of climate change , the kyoto protocol failed .
the lockstep situation of the ipcc is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different , if not opposing goals .
according to sheldon ungar 's comparison with global warming , the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties .
in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol , varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem .
the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts .
in the uk , a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the stern review ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change .
since the ipcc does not carry out its own research , it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies , and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report 's final release .
in principle , this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report can not be included .

they then use the atp and nadph to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the calvin cycle .
the number of chloroplasts per cell varies from 1 in algae up to 100 in plants like arabidopsis and wheat .
chloroplasts are highly dynamic—they circulate and are moved around within plant cells , and occasionally pinch in two to reproduce .
their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity .
chloroplasts , like mitochondria , contain their own dna , which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell .
chloroplasts , like mitochondria , contain their own dna , which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell .
chloroplasts can not be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division .
chloroplasts are only found in plants and algae .
this origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the russian biologist konstantin mereschkowski in 1905 after andreas schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria .

cyanobacteria are considered the ancestors of chloroplasts .
they are sometimes called blue-green algae even though they are prokaryotes .
they are a diverse phylum of bacteria capable of carrying out photosynthesis , and are gram-negative , meaning that they have two cell membranes .
cyanobacteria also contain a peptidoglycan cell wall , which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria , and which is located between their two cell membranes .
they are sometimes called blue-green algae even though they are prokaryotes .
somewhere around a billion years ago , a free-living cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell , either as food or as an internal parasite , but managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in .

the two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium 's gram negative cell wall , and not the phagosomal membrane from the host , which was probably lost .
the two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium 's gram negative cell wall , and not the phagosomal membrane from the host , which was probably lost .
over time , the cyanobacterium was assimilated , and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host .
these chloroplasts , which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor , are known as primary plastids ( " plastid " in this context means almost the same thing as chloroplast ) .
all primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages—the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage , the rhodophyte , or red algal chloroplast lineage , or the chloroplastidan , or green chloroplast lineage .

all primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages—the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage , the rhodophyte , or red algal chloroplast lineage , or the chloroplastidan , or green chloroplast lineage .
the second two are the largest , and the green chloroplast lineage is the one that contains the land plants .
the alga cyanophora , a glaucophyte , is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast .
the alga cyanophora , a glaucophyte , is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast .
for this reason , glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts .
glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids , which surround a carboxysome - an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in .

rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments ; the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color .
rhodoplasts have a double membrane with an intermembrane space and phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes on the thylakoid membranes , preventing their thylakoids from stacking .
rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments ; the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color .
the red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help red algae catch more sunlight in deep water—as such , some red algae that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts , and can appear more greenish .
rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called floridean , which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast , in the cytoplasm of the red alga .
they differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes , and contain chlorophyll b instead .
most green chloroplasts are ( obviously ) green , though some are n't , like some forms of hæmatococcus pluvialis , due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls ' green colors .
chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane , and have replaced it with an intermembrane space .
some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer , though they 've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead .
they differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes , and contain chlorophyll b instead .
while primary chloroplasts have a double membrane from their cyanobacterial ancestor , secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two , as a result of the secondary endosymbiotic event , when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it—much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story .

the engulfed alga was broken down , leaving only its chloroplast , and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus , forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes—the two cyanobacterial membranes , sometimes the eaten alga 's cell membrane , and the phagosomal vacuole from the host 's cell membrane .

euglenophytes are a group of common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga .
euglenophytes are a group of common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga .
euglenophyte chloroplasts have a pyrenoid and thylakoids stacked in groups of three .
starch is stored in the form of paramylon , which is contained in membrane-bound granules in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte .
euglenophyte chloroplasts have three membranes—it is thought that the membrane of the primary endosymbiont was lost , leaving the cyanobacterial membranes , and the secondary host 's phagosomal membrane .
cryptophytes , or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast .
cryptophytes , or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast .
cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes .
they synthesize ordinary starch , which is stored in granules found in the periplastid space—outside the original double membrane , in the place that corresponds to the red alga 's cytoplasm .
inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two .
like the helicosproidia , they 're parasitic , and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast .
apicomplexans are another group of chromalveolates .
the apicomplexans include plasmodium , the malaria parasite .
many apicomplexans keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast , which they inherited from their ancestors .
apicomplexans store their energy in amylopectin starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm , even though they are nonphotosynthetic .
plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar , and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize fatty acids , isopentenyl pyrophosphate , iron-sulfur clusters , and carry out part of the heme pathway .
this makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases .
the most important apicoplast function is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis—in fact , apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function , and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium , they dump the organelle .
apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function , and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids .
they are bounded by four membranes , but the membranes are not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum .
peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts .
the most common dinophyte chloroplast is the peridinin-type chloroplast , characterized by the carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts , along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2 .
they contain a pyrenoid , and have triplet-stacked thylakoids .
the peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes ( occasionally two ) , having lost the red algal endosymbiont 's original cell membrane .
the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages ( including karlodinium and karenia ) lost their original red algal derived chloroplast , and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a haptophyte endosymbiont .
the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages ( including karlodinium and karenia ) lost their original red algal derived chloroplast , and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a haptophyte endosymbiont .
because the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes , tertiary endosymbiosis would be expected to create a six membraned chloroplast , adding the haptophyte 's cell membrane and the dinophyte 's phagosomal vacuole .

members of the genus dinophysis have a phycobilin-containing chloroplast taken from a cryptophyte .
however , the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont—only the chloroplast seems to have been taken , and the chloroplast has been stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes , leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast .

some dinophytes , like kryptoperidinium and durinskia have a diatom ( heterokontophyte ) derived chloroplast .
some dinophytes , like kryptoperidinium and durinskia have a diatom ( heterokontophyte ) derived chloroplast .
these chloroplasts are bounded by up to five membranes , ( depending on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast , or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it ) .

however the diatom endosymbiont ca n't store its own food—its starch is found in granules in the dinophyte host 's cytoplasm instead .
the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus .
lepidodinium is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that 's not from the rhodoplast lineage .
lepidodinium viride and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast ( more specifically , a prasinophyte ) .

while most chloroplasts originate from that first set of endosymbiotic events , paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently .

chromatophore dna is about a million base pairs long , containing around 850 protein encoding genes—far less than the three million base pair synechococcus genome , but much larger than the approximately 150,000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast .

chloroplasts have their own dna , often abbreviated as ctdna , or cpdna .
it is also known as the plastome .
its existence was first proved in 1962 , and first sequenced in 1986—when two japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast dna of liverwort and tobacco .

the inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants , and accumulate few mutations .
similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages ( glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ ) , suggesting that they predate the chloroplast , though some chloroplast dnas have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats ( making them direct repeats ) .
it is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome , as chloroplast dnas which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more .
scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s .
the mechanism for chloroplast dna ( cpdna ) replication has not been conclusively determined , but two main models have been proposed .
as the d-loop moves through the circular dna , it adopts a theta intermediary form , also known as a cairns replication intermediate , and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism .

in cpdna , there are several a → g deamination gradients .
dna becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded .
this mechanism is still the leading theory today ; however , a second theory suggests that most cpdna is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination .
this mechanism is still the leading theory today ; however , a second theory suggests that most cpdna is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination .
it further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched , linear , or other complex structures .
one of competing model for cpdna replication asserts that most cpdna is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage t4 .
it has been established that some plants have linear cpdna , such as maize , and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand .
because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpdna , the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpdna is circular and most likely replicates via a d loop mechanism .

endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages .
even if a chloroplast is eventually lost , the genes it donated to the former host 's nucleus persist , providing evidence for the lost chloroplast 's existence .
for example , while diatoms ( a heterokontophyte ) now have a red algal derived chloroplast , the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor ( probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too ) had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point , which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast .

a few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes , though a few trna genes still work in the mitochondrion .
curiously , around half of the protein products of transferred genes are n't even targeted back to the chloroplast .
many became exaptations , taking on new functions like participating in cell division , protein routing , and even disease resistance .
some transferred chloroplast dna protein products get directed to the secretory pathway ( though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host 's cell membrane , and therefore topologically outside of the cell , because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol , you have to cross the cell membrane , just like if you were headed for the extracellular space .
after a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol , an enzyme specific to chloroplast proteins phosphorylates , or adds a phosphate group to many ( but not all ) of them in their transit sequences .

greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae , which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net ( e.g. , oedogonium ) , a cup ( e.g. , chlamydomonas ) , a ribbon-like spiral around the edges of the cell ( e.g. , spirogyra ) , or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges ( e.g. , sirogonium ) .

the fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria .
this is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host 's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium—which is not true—both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacterium 's original double membranes .

the chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane .
this is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate atp energy .
this is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate atp energy .
the only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous to it is the internal thylakoid system .
in addition , in terms of function , the inner chloroplast membrane , which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials , has no counterpart in the mitochondrion .
stromules are very rare in chloroplasts , and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots , respectively .
the chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm , forming a stromule , or stroma-containing tubule .
they may exist to increase the chloroplast 's surface area for cross-membrane transport , because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum .
when they were first observed in 1962 , some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual , claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts .
it is often found in the chloroplasts of c4 plants , though it has also been found in some c3 angiosperms , and even some gymnosperms .
it is often found in the chloroplasts of c4 plants , though it has also been found in some c3 angiosperms , and even some gymnosperms .
the chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast .
its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast 's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm .
the small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space .
chloroplasts have their own ribosomes , which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins .
chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes ( around 17 nm vs 25 nm ) .

they are surrounded by a lipid monolayer .
plastoglobuli were once thought to be free-floating in the stroma , but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid , a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network .

in normal green chloroplasts , the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly , attached directly to their parent thylakoid .
in old or stressed chloroplasts , plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains , still always anchored to a thylakoid .
the chloroplasts of some hornworts and algae contain structures called pyrenoids .

molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space , decreasing the ph and turning it acidic .
atp synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate atp energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine .
there are two types of thylakoids—granal thylakoids , which are arranged in grana , and stromal thylakoids , which are in contact with the stroma .

to fix carbon dioxide into sugar molecules in the process of photosynthesis , chloroplasts use an enzyme called rubisco .
rubisco has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen , so at high oxygen concentrations , rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors .
rubisco has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen , so at high oxygen concentrations , rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors .
this is a big problem , since o2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis , causing issues down the line in the calvin cycle which uses rubisco .
this has the end result of atp energy being wasted and co2 being released , all with no sugar being produced .
in mesophyll cells , chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions , so they lack rubisco , and have normal grana and thylakoids , which they use to make atp and nadph , as well as oxygen .

they store co2 in a four-carbon compound , which is why the process is called c4 photosynthesis .
because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the calvin cycle and make sugar , they often contain large starch grains .
all green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts , or more specifically , the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green .

a plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell .

in some plants such as cacti , chloroplasts are found in the stems , though in most plants , chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves .
palisade mesophyll cells can contain 30–70 chloroplasts per cell , while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8–15 per cell , as well as much less chlorophyll .
one square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts .
within a leaf , chloroplasts are mainly found in the mesophyll layers of a leaf , and the guard cells of stomata .
in low-light conditions , they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light .
under intense light , they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell 's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on .
this reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage .
this ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones .
mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move .
plants have two main immune responses—the hypersensitive response , in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death , and systemic acquired resistance , where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen 's presence .

after detecting stress in a cell , which might be due to a pathogen , chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals .
after detecting stress in a cell , which might be due to a pathogen , chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals .
as cellular signals , reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules , so they probably do n't leave the chloroplast , but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule .
all these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus .
one of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis , the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy , to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars .

like mitochondria , chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an h+ , or hydrogen ion gradient to generate atp energy .
the molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons ' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space , creating a concentration gradient , with more hydrogen ions ( up to a thousand times as many ) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma .

atp synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate , or atp .
atp synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate , or atp .
normally , the reenergized electrons are taken by nadp+ , though sometimes they can flow back down more h+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more atp .
this is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled .
cyclic photophosphorylation is common in c4 plants , which need more atp than nadph .

the calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme rubisco to fix co2 into five-carbon ribulose bisphosphate ( rubp ) molecules .
the result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid , or 3-pga .
the result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid , or 3-pga .
most of the g3p molecules are recycled back into rubp using energy from more atp , but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle—the end product of the dark reactions .
alternatively , glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch , which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast .
under conditions such as high atmospheric co2 concentrations , these starch grains may grow very large , distorting the grana and thylakoids .
under conditions such as high atmospheric co2 concentrations , these starch grains may grow very large , distorting the grana and thylakoids .
waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts , possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast ( or more accurately , the plant cell ) .
while linked to low photosynthesis rates , the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis , and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor .
rubisco can not distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well , so it can accidentally add o2 instead of co2 to rubp .
photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high .
this process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes atp and oxygen , releases co2 , and produces no sugar .
it can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the calvin cycle .
chloroplasts in c4 plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism .
chloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cell 's amino acids in their stroma except the sulfur-containing ones like cysteine and methionine .
chloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cell 's amino acids in their stroma except the sulfur-containing ones like cysteine and methionine .
cysteine is made in the chloroplast ( the proplastid too ) but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria , probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed .
the chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol .
chloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a plastid , though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably .
all chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote , or fertilized egg .
proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant 's apical meristems .
chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in root tip meristems—instead , the formation of starch-storing amyloplasts is more common .
if angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation , proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts .
an etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll , and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma , called a prolamellar body .

while etioplasts lack chlorophyll , they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked .
gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts .
chloroplasts may be converted to chromoplasts , which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit .

if a plant is injured , or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state , chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids .
the division process starts when the proteins ftsz1 and ftsz2 assemble into filaments , and with the help of a protein arc6 , form a structure called a z-ring within the chloroplast 's stroma .

in a few species like cyanidioschyzon merolæ , chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast 's intermembrane space .
light has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division .
chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light , but are slow to complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division .
spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts .
chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light , but are slow to complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division .
since , in most flowering plants , chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent , transgenes in these plastids can not be disseminated by pollen .
this makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained , thus posing significantly lower environmental risks .
while the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species , recent results in tobacco plants are promising , showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000 .

a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself .
a natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number .
for example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering .

the uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e.g. , 3 , 1 · 3 , 1 · 1 · 3 , etc .
the property of being prime ( or not ) is called primality .
a simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division .
these include the miller–rabin primality test , which is fast but has a small probability of error , and the aks primality test , which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical .

however , the distribution of primes , that is to say , the statistical behaviour of primes in the large , can be modelled .
the first result in that direction is the prime number theorem , proven at the end of the 19th century , which says that the probability that a given , randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits , or to the logarithm of n .

many questions regarding prime numbers remain open , such as goldbach 's conjecture ( that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes ) , and the twin prime conjecture ( that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2 ) .

such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory , focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers .
primes are used in several routines in information technology , such as public-key cryptography , which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors .
prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains , mainly algebra , such as prime elements and prime ideals .
the image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime : 12 = 3 · 4. no even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition , any such number n has at least three distinct divisors , namely 1 , 2 , and n. this implies that n is not prime .

accordingly , the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2. similarly , when written in the usual decimal system , all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1 , 3 , 7 , or 9 , since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5 .

most early greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number , so they could not consider it to be a prime .
in the mid-18th century christian goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with leonhard euler -- who did not agree .
in the mid-18th century christian goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with leonhard euler -- who did not agree .
for example , derrick norman lehmer 's list of primes up to 10,006,721 , reprinted as late as 1956 , started with 1 as its first prime .
by the early 20th century , mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number , but rather forms its own special category as a " unit " .
a large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime , but euclid 's fundamental theorem of arithmetic ( mentioned above ) would not hold as stated .
similarly , the sieve of eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime : a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 ( that is , all other numbers ) and produce as output only the single number 1. furthermore , the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks , such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of euler 's totient function or the sum of divisors function .

there are hints in the surviving records of the ancient egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers : the egyptian fraction expansions in the rhind papyrus , for instance , have quite different forms for primes and for composites .
however , the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the ancient greeks .
euclid 's elements ( circa 300 bc ) contain important theorems about primes , including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic .
euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a mersenne prime .
the sieve of eratosthenes , attributed to eratosthenes , is a simple method to compute primes , although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way .

fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime ( they are called fermat numbers ) and he verified this up to n = 4 ( or 216 + 1 ) .
the french monk marin mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1 , with p a prime .

the most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division .
this routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime .
this routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. if the result of any of these divisions is an integer , then n is not a prime , otherwise it is a prime .
for example , to check the primality of 37 , only three divisions are necessary ( m = 2 , 3 , and 5 ) , given that 4 and 6 are composite .

modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes , probabilistic ( or " monte carlo " ) and deterministic algorithms .
for example , trial division is a deterministic algorithm because , if performed correctly , it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite .
if we repeat the test n times and pass every time , then the probability that our number is composite is 1/ ( 1-p ) n , which decreases exponentially with the number of tests , so we can be as sure as we like ( though never perfectly sure ) that the number is prime .
a particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the fermat primality test , which relies on the fact ( fermat 's little theorem ) that np≡n ( mod p ) for any n if p is a prime number .

a flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers ( the carmichael numbers ) that satisfy the fermat identity even though they are not prime , so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and carmichael numbers .
more powerful extensions of the fermat primality test , such as the baillie-psw , miller-rabin , and solovay-strassen tests , are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number .

other primes where either p + 1 or p − 1 is of a particular shape include the sophie germain primes ( primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime ) , primorial primes , fermat primes and mersenne primes , that is , prime numbers that are of the form 2p − 1 , where p is an arbitrary prime .

some of these primes have been found using distributed computing .
in 2009 , the great internet mersenne prime search project was awarded a us $ 100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits .

the electronic frontier foundation also offers $ 150,000 and $ 250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits , respectively .
some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form ( that is , no simple formula such as that of mersenne primes ) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data , converting it to a number n , multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k , and searching for possible primes within the interval [ 256kn + 1 , 256k ( n + 1 ) − 1 ] .

the latter formula can be shown using bertrand 's postulate ( proven first by chebyshev ) , which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2 , for any natural number n > 3. however , computing a or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with .

another formula is based on wilson 's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once .
can have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime , i.e. , their greatest common divisor is one .
if this necessary condition is satisfied , dirichlet 's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes .
what is more , the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run—the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6 .
the rows ( =progressions ) starting with a = 3 , 6 , or 9 contain at most one prime number .
in all other rows ( a = 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 8 ) there are infinitely many prime numbers .
the zeta function is closely related to prime numbers .
for example , the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function : if there were only finitely many primes then ζ ( 1 ) would have a finite value .
however , the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges ( i.e. , exceeds any given number ) , so there must be infinitely many primes .

another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity ( basel problem ) , due to euler ,
the unproven riemann hypothesis , dating from 1859 , states that except for s = −2 , −4 , ... , all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2 .

one of them is goldbach 's conjecture , which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes .
often having an elementary formulation , many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades : all four of landau 's problems from 1912 are still unsolved .
as of february 2011 [ update ] , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017. weaker statements than this have been proven , for example vinogradov 's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes .

polignac 's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture , it states that for every positive integer n , there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n .
it is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. these conjectures are special cases of the broad schinzel 's hypothesis h. brocard 's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. legendre 's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and ( n + 1 ) 2 for every positive integer n. it is implied by the stronger cramér 's conjecture .

for a long time , number theory in general , and the study of prime numbers in particular , was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics , with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly .
in particular , number theorists such as british mathematician g. h. hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance .
however , this vision was shattered in the 1970s , when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms .
prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators .

another consequence of fermat 's little theorem is the following : if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5 , 1/p is always a recurring decimal , whose period is p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1. the fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q ( rather than base 10 ) has similar effect , provided that p is not a prime factor of q. wilson 's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial ( p − 1 ) !

the evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus magicicada make use of prime numbers .
these insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground .
they only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7 , 13 or 17 years , at which point they fly about , breed , and then die after a few weeks at most .
the logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on magicicadas .
over a 200-year period , average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2 % higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas .
generally , " prime " indicates minimality or indecomposability , in an appropriate sense .
for example , the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field f containing both 0 and 1. it is either q or the finite field with p elements , whence the name .
any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots .
often a second , additional meaning is intended by using the word prime , namely that any object can be , essentially uniquely , decomposed into its prime components .
for example , in knot theory , a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it can not be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots .

an element p of r is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit ( i.e. , does not have a multiplicative inverse ) and satisfies the following requirement : given x and y in r such that p divides the product xy , then p divides x or y. an element is irreducible if it is not a unit and can not be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units .

the fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains .
an example of such a domain is the gaussian integers z [ i ] , that is , the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers .

in ring theory , the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal .
prime ideals , which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal , are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra , algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry .
prime ideals , which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal , are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra , algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry .
the prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals ( 0 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 11 ) , … the fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the lasker–noether theorem , which expresses every ideal in a noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals , which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers .

prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects , via the notion of the spectrum of a ring .
for example , factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field , a basic problem of algebraic number theory , bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry .
for example , prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity , a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations

in particular , this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p , in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value ( also referred to as the infinite prime ) .
certain arithmetic questions related to q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed ( or local ) fields .
while completing q ( roughly , filling the gaps ) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers , completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers .
this local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory .
the french composer olivier messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through " natural phenomena " .
in works such as la nativité du seigneur ( 1935 ) and quatre études de rythme ( 1949–50 ) , he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms : the primes 41 , 43 , 47 and 53 appear in the third étude , " neumes rythmiques " .

the rhine-meuse delta , the most important natural region of the netherlands begins near millingen aan de rijn , close to the dutch-german border with the division of the rhine into waal and nederrijn .
since the rhine contributes most of the water , the shorter term rhine delta is commonly used .
the shape of the rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations : first , at millingen aan de rijn , the rhine splits into waal and pannerdens kanaal , which changes its name to nederrijn at angeren , and second near arnhem , the ijssel branches off from the nederrijn .
this creates three main flows , two of which change names rather often .
the largest and southern main branch begins as waal and continues as boven merwede ( " upper merwede " ) , beneden merwede ( " lower merwede " ) , noord river ( " north river " ) , nieuwe maas ( " new meuse " ) , het scheur ( " the rip " ) and nieuwe waterweg ( " new waterway " ) .
three more flows carry significant amounts of water : the nieuwe merwede ( " new merwede " ) , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from boven to beneden merwede ; the oude maas ( " old meuse " ) , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from beneden merwede into noord , and dordtse kil , which branches off from oude maas .

the rhine-meuse delta is a tidal delta , shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers , but also by tidal currents .
the rhine-meuse delta is a tidal delta , shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers , but also by tidal currents .
this meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea .
at the waal , for example , the most landward tidal influence can be detected between brakel and zaltbommel .
the present mediterranean sea descends from this somewhat larger tethys sea .
at about 180 mbp , in the jurassic period , the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the tethys floor , causing it to be subducted under eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the alpine orogeny of the oligocene and miocene periods .
several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of mediterranean geography : iberia pushed up the pyrenees ; italy , the alps , and anatolia , moving west , the mountains of greece and the islands .
in southern europe , the stage was set in the triassic period of the mesozoic era , with the opening of the tethys ocean , between the eurasian and african tectonic plates , between about 240 mbp and 220 mbp ( million years before present ) .
several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of mediterranean geography : iberia pushed up the pyrenees ; italy , the alps , and anatolia , moving west , the mountains of greece and the islands .
from the eocene onwards , the ongoing alpine orogeny caused a n–s rift system to develop in this zone .
the main elements of this rift are the upper rhine graben , in southwest germany and eastern france and the lower rhine embayment , in northwest germany and the southeastern netherlands .
by the time of the miocene , a river system had developed in the upper rhine graben , that continued northward and is considered the first rhine river .
at that time , it did not yet carry discharge from the alps ; instead , the watersheds of the rhone and danube drained the northern flanks of the alps .
through stream capture , the rhine extended its watershed southward .
by the pliocene period , the rhine had captured streams down to the vosges mountains , including the mosel , the main and the neckar .

around 2.5 million years ago ( ending 11,600 years ago ) was the geological period of the ice ages .
since approximately 600,000 years ago , six major ice ages have occurred , in which sea level dropped 120 m ( 390 ft ) and much of the continental margins became exposed .

in the early pleistocene , the rhine followed a course to the northwest , through the present north sea .
since then , during glacial times , the river mouth was located offshore of brest , france and rivers , like the thames and the seine , became tributaries to the rhine .
the last glacial ran from ~74,000 ( bp = before present ) , until the end of the pleistocene ( ~11,600 bp ) .
the last glacial ran from ~74,000 ( bp = before present ) , until the end of the pleistocene ( ~11,600 bp ) .
during this time , the lower rhine flowed roughly west through the netherlands and extended to the southwest , through the english channel and finally , to the atlantic ocean .
the english channel , the irish channel and most of the north sea were dry land , mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m ( 390 ft ) lower than today .

most of the rhine 's current course was not under the ice during the last ice age ; although , its source must still have been a glacier .
a tundra , with ice age flora and fauna , stretched across middle europe , from asia to the atlantic ocean .

the loess or wind-blown dust over that tundra , settled in and around the rhine valley , contributing to its current agricultural usefulness .
as northwest europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward , frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring .
as northwest europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward , frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring .
much of the discharge was routed to the rhine and its downstream extension .
rapid warming and changes of vegetation , to open forest , began about 13,000 bp .
by 9000 bp , europe was fully forested .
since 7500 yr ago , a situation with tides and currents , very similar to present has existed .
rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far , that natural sedimentation by the rhine and coastal processes together , could compensate the transgression by the sea ; in the last 7000 years , the coast line was roughly at the same location .

as sea-level continued to rise in the netherlands , the formation of the holocene rhine-meuse delta began ( ~8,000 years ago ) .
since ~3000 yr bp ( = years before present ) , human impact is seen in the delta .
this caused increased flooding and sedimentation , ending peat formation in the delta .
as a result of increasing land clearance ( bronze age agriculture ) , in the upland areas ( central germany ) , the sediment load of the rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up .
this was followed by embankment , of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries , which took place in the 11–13th century ad .
over the past 6000 years , approximately 80 avulsions have occurred .

the discharge of the rhine is divided among three branches : the river waal ( 6/9 of total discharge ) , the river nederrijn – lek ( 2/9 of total discharge ) and the river ijssel ( 1/9 of total discharge ) .
the rhine was not known to herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century bc in roman-era geography .
at that time , it formed the boundary between gaul and germania .
the upper rhine had been part of the areal of the late hallstatt culture since the 6th century bc , and by the 1st century bc , the areal of the la tène culture covered almost its entire length , forming a contact zone with the jastorf culture , i.e .

from the death of augustus in ad 14 until after ad 70 , rome accepted as her germanic frontier the water-boundary of the rhine and upper danube .
the northern section of this frontier , where the rhine is deep and broad , remained the roman boundary until the empire fell .
the germanic populations of these lands seem in roman times to have been scanty , and roman subjects from the modern alsace-lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards .
the southern part was different .
the romans kept eight legions in five bases along the rhine .
between about ad 14 and 180 , the assignment of legions was as follows : for the army of germania inferior , two legions at vetera ( xanten ) , i germanica and xx valeria ( pannonian troops ) ; two legions at oppidum ubiorum ( " town of the ubii " ) , which was renamed to colonia agrippina , descending to cologne , v alaudae , a celtic legion recruited from gallia narbonensis and xxi , possibly a galatian legion from the other side of the empire .

since the peace of westphalia , the upper rhine formed a contentious border between france and germany .
establishing " natural borders " on the rhine was a long-term goal of french foreign policy , since the middle ages , though the language border was – and is – far more to the west .
the confederation of the rhine was established by napoleon , as a french client state , in 1806 and lasted until 1814 , during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the first french empire .

in 1840 , the rhine crisis , prompted by french prime minister adolphe thiers 's desire to reinstate the rhine as a natural border , led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in germany .
at the end of world war i , the rhineland was subject to the treaty of versailles .
this decreed that it would be occupied by the allies , until 1935 and after that , it would be a demilitarised zone , with the german army forbidden to enter .

the treaty of versailles and this particular provision , in general , caused much resentment in germany and is often cited as helping adolf hitler 's rise to power .
the allies left the rhineland , in 1930 and the german army re-occupied it in 1936 , which was enormously popular in germany .
the rhine bridge at arnhem , immortalized in the book , a bridge too far and the film , was a central focus of the battle for arnhem , during the failed operation market garden of september 1944. the bridges at nijmegen , over the waal distributary of the rhine , were also an objective of operation market garden .
in world war ii , it was recognised that the rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of germany , by the western allies .
the rhine bridge at arnhem , immortalized in the book , a bridge too far and the film , was a central focus of the battle for arnhem , during the failed operation market garden of september 1944. the bridges at nijmegen , over the waal distributary of the rhine , were also an objective of operation market garden .
in a separate operation , the ludendorff bridge , crossing the rhine at remagen , became famous , when u.s. forces were able to capture it intact – much to their own surprise – after the germans failed to demolish it .
seven days to the river rhine was a warsaw pact war plan for an invasion of western europe during the cold war .
until 1932 the generally accepted length of the rhine was 1,230 kilometres ( 764 miles ) .
in 1932 the german encyclopedia knaurs lexikon stated the length as 1,320 kilometres ( 820 miles ) , presumably a typographical error .

suggestions for a 'devolved ' parliament were made before 1914 , but were shelved due to the outbreak of the first world war .
a sharp rise in nationalism in scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence , and in 1969 prompted the incumbent labour government of harold wilson to set up the kilbrandon commission to consider the british constitution .
kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected scottish assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic scottish affairs .
during this time , the discovery of oil in the north sea and the following " it 's scotland 's oil " campaign of the scottish national party ( snp ) resulted in rising support for scottish independence , as well as the snp .

the 1979 scottish devolution referendum to establish a devolved scottish assembly failed .

throughout the 1980s and 1990s , demand for a scottish parliament grew , in part because the government of the united kingdom was controlled by the conservative party , while scotland itself elected relatively few conservative mps .

in the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat , the campaign for a scottish assembly was initiated as a pressure group , leading to the 1989 scottish constitutional convention with various organisations such as scottish churches , political parties and representatives of industry taking part .
publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995 , the convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the parliament .
since september 2004 , the official home of the scottish parliament has been a new scottish parliament building , in the holyrood area of edinburgh .
the scottish parliament building was designed by spanish architect enric miralles in partnership with local edinburgh architecture firm rmjm which was led by design principal tony kettle .

some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings , a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings .
queen elizabeth ii opened the new building on 9 october 2004 .
this building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the church 's general assembly .
whilst the permanent building at holyrood was being constructed , the parliament 's temporary home was the general assembly hall of the church of scotland on the royal mile in edinburgh .
official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the assembly hall , which is part of the school of divinity of the university of edinburgh .
in may 2000 , the parliament was temporarily relocated to the former strathclyde regional council debating chamber in glasgow , and to the university of aberdeen in may 2002 .

in addition to the general assembly hall , the parliament also used buildings rented from the city of edinburgh council .
the former administrative building of lothian regional council on george iv bridge was used for the msp 's offices .
following the move to holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished .
the former midlothian county buildings facing parliament square , high street and george iv bridge in edinburgh ( originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 midlothian county council ) housed the parliament 's visitors ' centre and shop , whilst the main hall was used as the parliament 's principal committee room .

a vote clerk sits in front of the presiding officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks .
as a member of the scottish parliamentary corporate body , the presiding officer is responsible for ensuring that the parliament functions effectively and has the staff , property and resources it requires to operate .
convening the parliamentary bureau , which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber , is another of the roles of the presiding officer .
under the standing orders of the parliament the bureau consists of the presiding officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the parliament .
the presiding officer also represents the scottish parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity .
the debating chamber of the scottish parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle , which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members .

there are 131 seats in the debating chamber .
of the total 131 seats , 129 are occupied by the parliament 's elected msps and 2 are seats for the scottish law officers – the lord advocate and the solicitor general for scotland , who are not elected members of the parliament but are members of the scottish government .
as such the law officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the parliament but , as they are not elected msps , can not vote .
in front of the presiding officers ' desk is the parliamentary mace , which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from scottish rivers and inscribed with the words : wisdom , compassion , justice and integrity .

parliament typically sits tuesdays , wednesdays and thursdays from early january to late june and from early september to mid december , with two-week recesses in april and october .
plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on thursdays from 9:15 am to 6 pm .
chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public .
entry is free , but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space .
proceedings are also recorded in text form , in print and online , in the official report , which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates .
the first item of business on wednesdays is usually time for reflection , at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective on issues of faith .

invitations to address parliament in this manner are determined by the presiding officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau .
speakers are drawn from across scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the scottish census .
faith groups can make direct representations to the presiding officer to nominate speakers .
the presiding officer ( or deputy presiding officer ) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak .

normally , the presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak .
typically , ministers or party leaders open debates , with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes , and succeeding speakers allocated less time .
the scottish parliament has conducted debates in the gaelic language .
each sitting day , normally at 5 pm , msps decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day .
this " decision time " is heralded by the sounding of the division bell , which is heard throughout the parliamentary campus and alerts msps who are not in the chamber to return and vote .

if there is audible dissent , the presiding officer announces " there will be a division " and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks .
as a result , the outcome of each division is known in seconds .
the outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote .

parties entrust some msps , known as whips , with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line .
this is typically done on moral issues .
errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections , and , in serious cases , may be expelled from their parties outright .
immediately after decision time a " members debate " is held , which lasts for 45 minutes .
members business is a debate on a motion proposed by an msp who is not a scottish minister .
immediately after decision time a " members debate " is held , which lasts for 45 minutes .
as well as the proposer , other members normally contribute to the debate .
the relevant minister , whose department the debate and motion relate to " winds up " the debate by speaking after all other participants .
much of the work of the scottish parliament is done in committee .
the role of committees is stronger in the scottish parliament than in other parliamentary systems , partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber .

there are different committees with their functions set out in different ways .
mandatory committees are committees which are set down under the scottish parliament 's standing orders , which govern their remits and proceedings .
the current mandatory committees in the fourth session of the scottish parliament are : public audit ; equal opportunities ; european and external relations ; finance ; public petitions ; standards , procedures and public appointments ; and delegated powers and law reform .
subject committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session , and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across parliament .
typically each committee corresponds with one ( or more ) of the departments ( or ministries ) of the scottish government .
the current subject committees in the fourth session are : economy , energy and tourism ; education and culture ; health and sport ; justice ; local government and regeneration ; rural affairs , climate change and environment ; welfare reform ; and infrastructure and capital investment .

a further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the scottish parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the scottish parliament or scottish government .
private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property .
a further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the scottish parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the scottish parliament or scottish government .
private bill committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the edinburgh tram network , the glasgow airport rail link , the airdrie-bathgate rail link and extensions to the national gallery of scotland .
the scotland act 1998 , which was passed by the parliament of the united kingdom and given royal assent by queen elizabeth ii on 19 november 1998 , governs the functions and role of the scottish parliament and delimits its legislative competence .

the scotland act 2012 extends the devolved competencies .
for the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty , the parliament of the united kingdom at westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of scotland .
the scottish parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability .
the specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in schedule 5 to the scotland act as reserved matters .
all matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the scottish parliament .

the scottish parliament has the ability to alter income tax in scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound .
the 2012 act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns .
reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the scotland parliament .
the scottish parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to , and dealt with at , westminster ( and where ministerial functions usually lie with uk government ministers ) .

bills can be introduced to parliament in a number of ways ; the scottish government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill ; a committee of the parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit ; a member of the scottish parliament can introduce a bill as a private member ; or a private bill can be submitted to parliament by an outside proposer .

bills pass through parliament in a number of stages :
stage 1 is the first , or introductory stage of the bill , where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to parliament together with its accompanying documents – explanatory notes , a policy memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill , and a financial memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it .

statements from the presiding officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the parliament .
stage 1 usually takes place , initially , in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill .
if the whole parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill , it then proceeds to stage 2 .
stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole parliament .
this stage comprises two parts : consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill .
this stage comprises two parts : consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill .
opposition members can table " wrecking amendments " to the bill , designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time , to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken .
after a general debate on the final form of the bill , members proceed to vote at decision time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill .
royal assent : after the bill has been passed , the presiding officer submits it to the monarch for royal assent and it becomes an act of the scottish parliament .

however he can not do so until a 4-week period has elapsed , during which the law officers of the scottish government or uk government can refer the bill to the supreme court of the united kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the parliament .

instead they begin with a phrase that reads : " the bill for this act of the scottish parliament was passed by the parliament on [ date ] and received royal assent on [ date ] " .
the party , or parties , that hold the majority of seats in the parliament forms the scottish government .
any member can put their name forward to be first minister , and a vote is taken by all members of parliament .
in contrast to many other parliamentary systems , parliament elects a first minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term ( after a general election ) .
most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected msps , with the exception of scotland 's chief law officers : the lord advocate and the solicitor general .
whilst the first minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the sovereign .
under the scotland act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years ( 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on ) .
under the scotland act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years ( 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on ) .
the date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the monarch on the proposal of the presiding officer .
extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections , unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election , in which case they supplant it .
if the parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved ( with at least two-thirds of the members voting in favour ) , or if the parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be first minister within 28 days of a general election or of the position becoming vacant , the presiding officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the parliament is dissolved by the queen by royal proclamation .
several procedures enable the scottish parliament to scrutinise the government .
the first minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to parliament upon which msps are invited to question .
for example , at the beginning of each parliamentary year , the first minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the government 's legislative programme for the forthcoming year .
after the statement has been delivered , the leaders of the opposition parties and other msps question the first minister on issues related to the substance of the statement .
parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber .
a " general question time " takes place on a thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the scottish government .
a " general question time " takes place on a thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the scottish government .
this gives members an opportunity to question the first minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction .
the four general questions available to opposition leaders are :
of the 129 msps , 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as " constituency msps " .
the 73 scottish parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the uk parliament constituencies in scotland , prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of scottish mps , with the exception of orkney and shetland which each return their own constituency msp .
voters choose one member to represent the constituency , and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency msp .
the island archipelagos of orkney , shetland and the western isles comprise a much smaller number of electors , due to their dispersed population and distance from the scottish parliament in edinburgh .
currently , the average scottish parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors .
the total number of seats in the parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'hondt method .

the party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat , which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat .

this is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated .
as in the house of commons , a number of qualifications apply to being an msp .
such qualifications were introduced under the house of commons disqualification act 1975 and the british nationality act 1981. specifically , members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the united kingdom , the republic of ireland , one of the countries in the commonwealth of nations , a citizen of a british overseas territory , or a european union citizen resident in the uk .

members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the scottish parliament as elected msps , and similarly , civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified .
an individual may not sit in the scottish parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the mental health ( care and treatment ) ( scotland ) act 2003 .
the election produced a majority snp government , making this the first time in the scottish parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority .
the snp took 16 seats from labour , with many of their key figures not returned to parliament , although labour leader iain gray retained east lothian by 151 votes .

the snp took a further eight seats from the liberal democrats and one seat from the conservatives .
the snp overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the scottish parliament to hold a referendum on scottish independence .
for the conservatives , the main disappointment was the loss of edinburgh pentlands , the seat of former party leader david mcletchie , to the snp .

a procedural consequence of the establishment of the scottish parliament is that scottish mps sitting in the uk house of commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to england , wales and northern ireland – whilst english , scottish , welsh and northern irish westminster mps are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the scottish parliament .

this phenomenon is known as the west lothian question and has led to criticism .

islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the shari ' a .
the different islamist movements have been described as " oscillating between two poles " : at one end is a strategy of islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion ; at the other " reformist " pole islamists work to islamize society gradually " from the bottom up " .

moderate and reformist islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the tunisian ennahda movement .

radical islamist organizations like al-qaeda and the egyptian islamic jihad , and groups such as the taliban , entirely reject democracy , often declaring as kuffar those muslims who support it ( see takfirism ) , as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis .

another major division within islamism is between what graham e. fuller has described as the fundamentalist " guardians of the tradition " ( salafis , such as those in the wahhabi movement ) and the " vanguard of change and islamic reform " centered around the muslim brotherhood .
olivier roy argues that " sunni pan-islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century " when the muslim brotherhood movement and its focus on islamisation of pan-arabism was eclipsed by the salafi movement with its emphasis on " sharia rather than the building of islamic institutions , " and rejection of shia islam .

following the arab spring , roy has described islamism as " increasingly interdependent " with democracy in much of the arab muslim world , such that " neither can now survive without the other . "
while islamist political culture itself may not be democratic , islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy .
islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect islam , while the contrary idea that islam is , or can be , apolitical is an error .

islamists have asked the question , " if islam is a way of life , how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal , social , political , economic , and political spheres of life are not muslims , but islamists and believe in islamism , not [ just ] islam ? "
similarly , a writer for the international crisis group maintains that " the conception of 'political islam ' " is a creation of americans to explain the iranian islamic revolution and apolitical islam was a historical fluke of the " short-lived era of the heyday of secular arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970 " , and it is quietist/non-political islam , not islamism , that requires explanation .

this " gentlemen 's agreement " between sadat and islamists broke down in 1975 but not before islamists came to completely dominate university student unions .
sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in egypt in the 1990s .
the interpretation of islam promoted by this funding was the strict , conservative saudi-based wahhabism or salafism .
in its harshest form it preached that muslims should not only " always oppose " infidels " in every way , " but " hate them for their religion ... for allah 's sake , " that democracy " is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century , " that shia and other non-wahhabi muslims were infidels , etc .

while this effort has by no means converted all , or even most muslims to the wahhabist interpretation of islam , it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations , and has set the saudi-interpretation of islam as the " gold standard " of religion in minds of some or many muslims .
islamist movements such as the muslim brotherhood , " are well known for providing shelters , educational assistance , free or low cost medical clinics , housing assistance to students from out of town , student advisory groups , facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands , legal assistance , sports facilities , and women 's groups . "
all this compares very favourably against incompetent , inefficient , or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric .

while studying law and philosophy in england and germany , iqbal became a member of the london branch of the all india muslim league .
he was a critic of the mainstream indian nationalist and secularist indian national congress .
he came back to lahore in 1908. while dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry , iqbal had remained active in the muslim league .
iqbal 's seven english lectures were published by oxford university press in 1934 in a book titled the reconstruction of religious thought in islam .
iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of islam and muslim society , but that india 's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage , culture and political influence .
iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of islam and muslim society , but that india 's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage , culture and political influence .
in his travels to egypt , afghanistan , palestine and syria , he promoted ideas of greater islamic political co-operation and unity , calling for the shedding of nationalist differences .
sir muhammad iqbal was elected president of the muslim league in 1930 at its session in allahabad as well as for the session in lahore in 1932. in his allahabad address on 29 december 1930 , iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for muslim-majority provinces in northwestern india .
this address later inspired the pakistan movement .
sayyid abul ala maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the islamic revival in india , and then after independence from britain , in pakistan .
trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism , and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about islam and islamic law .
maududi founded the jamaat-e-islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972. however , maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising .

maududi also believed that muslim society could not be islamic without sharia , and islam required the establishment of an islamic state .
this state should be a " theo-democracy , " based on the principles of : tawhid ( unity of god ) , risala ( prophethood ) and khilafa ( caliphate ) .
although maududi talked about islamic revolution , by " revolution " he meant not the violence or populist policies of the iranian revolution , but the gradual changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah .

under the motto " the qur'an is our constitution , " it sought islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools , mosques , and workshops .
like maududi , al banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion , and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the muslim world .
some elements of the brotherhood , though perhaps against orders , did engage in violence against the government , and its founder al-banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of egypt 's premier mahmud fami naqrashi three months earlier .

despite periodic repression , the brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the islamic world , particularly in the arab world .
in the egyptian parliamentary election , 2011–2012 , the political parties identified as " islamist " ( the brotherhood 's freedom and justice party , salafi al-nour party and liberal islamist al-wasat party ) won 75 % of the total seats .

the defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries , was blamed on the secular arab nationalism of the ruling regimes .
a steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular , socialist and nationalist politics ensued .
ba'athism , arab socialism , and arab nationalism suffered , and different democratic and anti-democratic islamist movements inspired by maududi and sayyid qutb gained ground .
the views of ali shariati , ideologue of the iranian revolution , had resemblance with mohammad iqbal , ideological father of the state of pakistan , but khomeini 's beliefs is perceived to be placed somewhere between beliefs of sunni islamic thinkers like mawdudi and qutb .

he believed that complete imitation of the prophet mohammad and his successors such as ali for restoration of sharia law was essential to islam , that many secular , westernizing muslims were actually agents of the west serving western interests , and that the acts such as " plundering " of muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against islam by the western governments .

during the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict , the iranian government enjoyed something of a resurgence in popularity amongst the predominantly sunni " arab street , " due to its support for hezbollah and to president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's vehement opposition to the united states and his call that israel shall vanish .

the conflict , pitting indigenous impoverished muslims ( mujahideen ) against an anti-religious superpower , galvanized thousands of muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith .
while the military effectiveness of these " afghan arabs " was marginal , an estimated 16,000 to 35,000 muslim volunteers came from around the world came to fight in afghanistan .

another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radicalize the islamist movement was the gulf war , which brought several hundred thousand us and allied non-muslim military personnel to saudi arabian soil to put an end to saddam hussein 's occupation of kuwait .

prior to 1990 saudi arabia played an important role in restraining the many islamist groups that received its aid .
but when saddam , secularist and ba'athist dictator of neighboring iraq , attacked saudi arabia ( his enemy in the war ) , western troops came to protect the saudi monarchy .
islamists accused the saudi regime of being a puppet of the west .
these attacks resonated with conservative muslims and the problem did not go away with saddam 's defeat either , since american troops remained stationed in the kingdom , and a de facto cooperation with the palestinian-israeli peace process developed .
saudi arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic islamists who attacked it ( bin laden being a prime example ) , and increasing aid to islamic groups ( islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent islamist groups ) that did not , but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced .

the path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the egyptian islamic jihad organization responsible for the assassination of anwar sadat in 1981. unlike earlier anti-colonial movements the extremist group directed its attacks against what it believed were " apostate " leaders of muslim states , leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted western/foreign ideas and practices into islamic societies .

for some decades prior to the first palestine intifada in 1987 , the muslim brotherhood in palestine took a " quiescent " stance towards israel , focusing on preaching , education and social services , and benefiting from israel 's " indulgence " to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations .
as the first intifada gathered momentum and palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising , the brotherhood announced the formation of hamas ( " zeal " ) , devoted to jihad against israel .
rather than being more moderate than the plo , the 1988 hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand , calling for the destruction of israel and the establishment of an islamic state in palestine .
the brotherhood 's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab .

hamas has continued to be a major player in palestine .
from 2000 to 2007 it killed 542 people in 140 suicide bombing or " martyrdom operations " .

he also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education .

taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist fln government , it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following sharia law , economic liberalization and development program , education in arabic rather than french , and gender segregation , with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young algerian men .

in 1996 , a more conservative and anti-democratic islamist movement known as the taliban rose to power , defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80 % of afghanistan .

their ideology was also described as being influenced by wahhabism , and the extremist jihadism of their guest osama bin laden .
in july 1977 , general zia-ul-haq overthrew prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto 's regime in pakistan .
ali bhutto , a leftist in democratic competition with islamists , had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months , shortly before he was overthrown .
zia-ul-haq was much more committed to islamism , and " islamization " or implementation of islamic law , became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and islamism became his " official state ideology " .
in pakistan this islamization from above was " probably " more complete " than under any other regime except those in iran and sudan , " but zia-ul-haq was also criticized by many islamists for imposing " symbols " rather than substance , and using islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power .
zia-ul-haq was killed in 1988 but islamization remains an important element in pakistani society .
" the islamic state " , formerly known as the " islamic state of iraq and the levant " and before that as the " islamic state of iraq " , ( and called the acronym daesh by its many detractors ) , is a wahhabi/salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of sunni arabs from iraq and syria .

in 2014 , the group proclaimed itself a caliphate , with religious , political and military authority over all muslims worldwide .
originating as the jama'at al-tawhid wal-jihad in 1999 , it pledged allegiance to al-qaeda in 2004 , participated in the iraqi insurgency that followed the march 2003 invasion of iraq by western forces , joined the fight in the syrian civil war beginning in march 2011 , and was expelled from al-qaeda in early 2014 , ( which complained of its failure to consult and " notorious intransigence " ) .

the group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the united nations , the european union and member states , the united states , india , indonesia , turkey , saudi arabia , syria and other countries .
in its focus on the caliphate , the party takes a different view of muslim history than some other islamists such as muhammad qutb .
ht sees islam 's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of ali , or one of the other four rightly guided caliphs in the 7th century , but with the abolition of the ottoman caliphate in 1924. this is believed to have ended the true islamic system , something for which it blames " the disbelieving ( kafir ) colonial powers " working through turkish modernist mustafa kemal atatürk .

its name originated from the latin word " imperium " , which means to rule over large territories .
imperialism is " a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , use of military force , or other means " .
the term imperialism has been applied to western ( and japanese ) political and economic dominance especially in asia and africa in the 19th and 20th centuries .
it has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas .
imperialism is defined as " a policy of extending a country ’ s power and influence through diplomacy or military force . "
" formal imperialism " is defined as " physical control or full-fledged colonial rule " .
this is often through various forms of " othering " ( see other ) based on racial , religious , or cultural stereotypes .
" informal imperialism " is less direct ; however , it is still a powerful form of dominance .
to clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of " formal " and " informal " imperialism , the first meaning physical control or " full-fledged colonial rule " while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance .

the definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers , or simply , general-purpose aggressiveness .
this is because , with informal rule , the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority , enforcing land officials into large debts that can not be repaid , ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area , or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully .

the greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded .
european expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory .
the russian leader lenin suggested that " imperialism was the highest form of capitalism , claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism , and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism " .
geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market ; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations .
european empires in asia and africa " have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism : and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the european seaborne empires " .
the term " imperialism " is often conflated with " colonialism " , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition .
:116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus .
robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions .
contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism .
imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people .
imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control , yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two .
although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other , if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another , imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance , either formally or informally .
the meaning of imperialism is to create an empire , by conquering the other state 's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance .
colonialism 's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war .
colonialism can completely change the existing social structure , physical structure and economics of an area ; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations .
a controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds .
friedrich ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive , imperialism was needed .
by the races of highest 'social efficiency ' " .
the purportedly scientific nature of " social darwinism " and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism .
the rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose , for example throughout latin america " whiteness " is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento ( whitening ) are common .

geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of european guidance .
for instance , american geographer ellen churchill semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone .
tropicality can be paralleled with edward said ’ s orientalism as the west ’ s construction of the east as the “ other ” .
geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of european guidance .
according to siad , orientalism allowed europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm , which justified its dominance over the essentialized orient .
british imperialism often used the concept of terra nullius ( latin expression which stems from roman law meaning 'empty land ' ) .
the country of australia serves as a case study in relation to british settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century , as it was premised on terra nullius , and its settlers considered it unused by its sparse aboriginal inhabitants .
the principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the british empire " during the last generation , and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description " .

british imperialism often used the concept of terra nullius ( latin expression which stems from roman law meaning 'empty land ' ) .
orientalism , as theorized by edward said , refers to how the west developed an imaginative geography of the east .
this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west .
defining the east as a negative vision of itself , as its inferior , not only increased the west ’ s sense of self , but also was a way of ordering the east and making it known to the west so that it could be dominated and controlled .
the discourse of orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early western imperialism , as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social , cultural , political , and economic control of other territories .
this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west .
to better illustrate this idea , bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the " scramble for africa " .
this provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain " information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps " .
during his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques , he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory .

he states that maps " contributed to empire by promoting , assisting , and legitimizing the extension of french and british power into west africa " .
the americas during the pre-columbian era also had large empires such as the aztec empire and the incan empire .
imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of genghis khan during the mongol empire , and of other war-lords .
sub-saharan africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the european colonial era , for example the ethiopian empire , oyo empire , asante union , luba empire , lunda empire , and mutapa empire .

cultural imperialism is when a country 's influence is felt in social and cultural circles , i.e .
the importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes , fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture , control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc .
for example , depictions of opulent american lifestyles in the soap opera dallas during the cold war changed the expectations of romanians ; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled south korean drama series in north korea .
nor is such a usage of culture recent , as part of roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of roman culture and lifestyle , with the aim that they would then become willing participants .

europe 's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies , in combination with assuming political control by military and political means .
the colonization of india in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus : there , the " british exploited the political weakness of the mughal state , and , while military activity was important at various times , the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance " for the establishment of control over the subcontinent 's resources , markets , and manpower .

along with advancements in communication , europe also continued to advance in military technology .
european chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat , and with innovations in machinery they were able to manufacture improved firearms .
by the 1880s , the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon .
this technology gave european armies an advantage over their opponents , as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows , swords , and leather shields ( e.g .

in anglophone academic works , theories regarding imperialism are often based on the british experience .
the term " imperialism " was originally introduced into english in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of british prime minister benjamin disraeli .
for some , imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy ; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed .
in his writings lenin portrayed imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion .
the correlation between capitalism , aristocracy , and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists .
their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it 's impact on europe , as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the united states from the 1950s .
while these non-marxist writers were at their most prolific before world war i , they remained active in the interwar years .
hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation .
hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption , create wealth , and encourage a peaceful , tolerant , multipolar world order .
the concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples .
it was believed that a certain person 's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination .
for example , people living in tropical environments were seen as " less civilized " therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission .
across the three waves of european colonialism ( first in the americas , second in asia and lastly in africa ) , environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy .
this takes two forms , orientalism and tropicality .
according to geographic scholars under colonizing empires , the world could be split into climatic zones .
these scholars believed that northern europe and the mid-atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working , moral , and upstanding human being .
the people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the european empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure ; they were seen as incapable of such a feat .
similarly , orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location .

in world war ii , charles de gaulle and the free french used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate france .
however after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the empire .
france fought and lost a bitter war in vietnam in the 1950s .
whereas they won the war in algeria , the french leader at the time , charles de gaulle , decided to grant algeria independence anyway in 1962. its settlers and many local supporters relocated to france .
nearly all of france 's colonies gained independence by 1960 , but france retained great financial and diplomatic influence .

though john wesley originally wanted the methodists to stay within the church of england , the american revolution decisively separated the methodists in the american colonies from the life and sacraments of the anglican church .
in 1784 , after unsuccessful attempts to have the church of england send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies , wesley decisively appointed fellow priest thomas coke as superintendent ( bishop ) to organize a separate methodist society .

the united methodist church understands itself to be part of the holy catholic ( or universal ) church and it recognizes the historic ecumenical creeds , the apostle 's creed and the nicene creed ; which are used frequently in services of worship .
the book of discipline also recognizes the importance of the chalcedonian creed of the council of chalcedon .
it upholds the concept of the " visible and invisible church , " meaning that all who are truly believers in every age belong to the holy church invisible , while the united methodist church is a branch of the church visible , to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the word of god is preached and the sacraments are administered .

with the formation of the united methodist church in 1968 , theologian albert c. outler led the team which systematized denominational doctrine .
although united methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time , these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church 's founders , especially john wesley and charles wesley ( anglicans ) , but also philip william otterbein and martin boehm ( united brethren ) , and jacob albright ( evangelical association ) .

prevenient grace , or the grace that " goes before " us , is given to all people .
prevenient grace allows those tainted by sin to nevertheless make a truly free choice to accept or reject god 's salvation in christ .
justifying grace or accepting grace is that grace , offered by god to all people , that we receive by faith and trust in christ , through which god pardons the believer of sin .
the justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love god and neighbor .
today , justifying grace is also known as conversion , " accepting jesus as your personal lord and savior , " or being " born again " .

wesleyan theology stands at a unique cross-roads between evangelical and sacramental , between liturgical and charismatic , and between anglo-catholic and reformed theology and practice .
the united methodist church believes in prima scriptura , seeing the holy bible as the primary authority in the church and using sacred tradition , reason , and experience to interpret it , with the aid of the holy spirit ( see wesleyan quadrilateral ) .
today , the umc is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race , gender , and ideology , though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes .
therefore , according to the book of discipline , united methodist theology is at once " catholic , evangelical , and reformed . "

still , the denomination is pro-choice and also " was a founding member of the religious coalition for reproductive choice ... [ and ] 2008 general conference [ went ] on record in support of the work of the religious coalition for reproductive choice " .
as such , two official bodies of the united methodist church are part of the religious coalition for reproductive choice 's governing coalition , the general board of church and society , and the united methodist women .
the church emphasizes the need to be in supportive ministry with all women , regardless of their choice .
the church also holds that they " are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother , for whom devastating damage may result from an unacceptable pregnancy .
members of the united methodist church who identify with the pro-life position have organized into the taskforce of united methodists on abortion and sexuality ( tumas ) to further their position within the denomination .
there was an attempt to withdraw the united methodist church membership in the religious coalition for reproductive choice at their general conference , held in may 2012 , with a petition that passed through the legislative subcommittee and committee votes , but was not given a floor vote .
rev . paul t. stallsworth , president of the taskforce of united methodists on abortion and sexuality said he " had every reason to believe " that pro-life delegates would have won a floor vote .
historically , the methodist church has supported the temperance movement .
moreover , in 2011 and 2012 , the united methodist church 's general board of church and society called on all united methodists to abstain from alcohol for lent .
john wesley warned against the dangers of drinking in his famous sermon , " the use of money , " and in his letter to an alcoholic .
in fact , the united methodist church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of holy communion , thus " expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics , enabling the participation of children and youth , and supporting the church 's witness of abstinence . "
the united methodist church , along with other methodist churches , condemns capital punishment , saying that it can not accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life .
the united methodist church also believes that jesus explicitly repudiated the lex talionis in matthew 5:38-39 and abolished the death penalty in john 8:7. the general conference of the united methodist church calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence .

in addition , the united methodist church prohibits the celebration of same-sex unions .
jimmy creech was defrocked after a highly publicized church trial in 1999 on account of his participation in same-sex union ceremonies .
moreover , some churches , especially in 2016 after same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide , have provided blessings for same-sex marriages .
for example , the connectional table , a governing committee , has voted in favor of a proposal that calls for a localized option , which would permit ministers to officiate same-sex weddings , and it would allow conferences to ordain gay clergy .
additionally , many organizations , conferences , and congregations have recently called for broader acceptance of the lgbt community within the umc .
moreover , many conferences have taken a position by voting in favor of same-gender marriages with resolutions .
in 1987 , a united methodist church court in new hampshire defrocked methodist minister rose mary denman for openly living with a same-sex partner .
in 2005 , clergy credentials were removed from irene elizabeth stroud after she was convicted in a church trial of violating church law by engaging in a lesbian relationship ; this conviction was later upheld by the judicial council , the highest court in the denomination .
the baltimore-washington conference of the umc has approved the appointment of an openly partnered lesbian to the provisional diaconate .
the united methodist church opposes conscription as incompatible with the teaching of scripture .
the church also states that " as christians they are aware that neither the way of military action , nor the way of inaction is always righteous before god . "
therefore , the church supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously oppose all war , or any particular war , and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription .
the united methodist church maintains that war is incompatible with christ 's message and teachings .
therefore , the church rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy , to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide , brutal suppression of human rights , and unprovoked international aggression .
consequently , the united methodist church endorses general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .
the sexual ethics task force of the united methodist church states that " research shows it [ pornography ] is not an 'innocent activity . '
the united methodist church teaches that pornography is " about violence , degradation , exploitation , and coercion " and " deplore [ s ] all forms of commercialization , abuse , and exploitation of sex . "
persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered , as is their perspective , relationships with parishioners and family , and their perceptions of girls and women . "
the umc supports federal funding for research on embryos created for ivf that remain after the procreative efforts have ceased , if the embryos were provided for research instead of being destroyed , were not obtained by sale , and those donating had given prior informed consent for the research purposes .
it supports research on stem cells retrieved from umbilical cords and adult stem cells , stating that there are " few moral questions " raised by this issue .
the umc stands in " opposition to the creation of embryos for the sake of research " as " a human embryo , even at its earliest stages , commands our reverence . "

methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure ( e.g. , " st. james umc " ) .
such exemplary saints include martyrs , confessors of the faith , evangelists , or important biblical figures such as saint matthew , lutheran theologian and martyr to the nazis dietrich bonhoeffer , salvation army founder william booth , african missionary david livingstone and methodism 's revered founder john wesley are among many cited as protestant saints .

the french and indian war ( 1754–1763 ) was the north american theater of the worldwide seven years ' war .
the war was fought between the colonies of british america and new france , with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of great britain and france , as well as native american allies .
at the start of the war , the french north american colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 european settlers , compared with 2 million in the british north american colonies .
at the start of the war , the french north american colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 european settlers , compared with 2 million in the british north american colonies .
the war was fought primarily along the frontiers between new france and the british colonies , from virginia in the south to nova scotia in the north .
it began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the allegheny and monongahela rivers , called the forks of the ohio , and the site of the french fort duquesne and present-day pittsburgh , pennsylvania .
the dispute erupted into violence in the battle of jumonville glen in may 1754 , during which virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old george washington ambushed a french patrol .
in 1755 , six colonial governors in north america met with general edward braddock , the newly arrived british army commander , and planned a four-way attack on the french .
none succeeded and the main effort by braddock was a disaster ; he was defeated in the battle of the monongahela on july 9 , 1755 and died a few days later .
british operations in 1755 , 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of pennsylvania and new york all failed , due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , and effective canadian scouts , french regular forces , and indian warrior allies .
in 1755 , the british captured fort beauséjour on the border separating nova scotia from acadia ; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the acadians .

france concentrated its forces against prussia and its allies in the european theatre of the war .
though the british were later defeated at sainte foy in quebec , the french ceded canada in accordance with the 1763 treaty .
france ceded its territory east of the mississippi to great britain .
it ceded french louisiana west of the mississippi river ( including new orleans ) to its ally spain , in compensation for spain 's loss to britain of florida ( spain had ceded this to britain in exchange for the return of havana , cuba ) .
france 's colonial presence north of the caribbean was reduced to the islands of saint pierre and miquelon , confirming britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern north america .
as there had already been a king george 's war in the 1740s , british colonists named the second war in king george 's reign after their opponents , and it became known as the french and indian war .
this traditional name continues as the standard in the united states , but it obscures the fact that indians fought on both sides of the conflict , and that this was part of the seven years ' war , a much larger conflict between france and great britain .

french fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the st. lawrence and mississippi watersheds , did business with local tribes , and often married indian women .
british settlers outnumbered the french 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent , from nova scotia and newfoundland in the north , to georgia in the south .
british settlers outnumbered the french 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent , from nova scotia and newfoundland in the north , to georgia in the south .
while their population centers were along the coast , the settlements were growing into the interior .
in between the french and the british , large areas were dominated by native tribes .
to the north , the mi'kmaq and the abenaki were engaged in father le loutre 's war and still held sway in parts of nova scotia , acadia , and the eastern portions of the province of canada , as well as much of present-day maine .
the iroquois confederation dominated much of present-day upstate new york and the ohio country , although the latter also included algonquian-speaking populations of delaware and shawnee , as well as iroquoian-speaking mingo .
these tribes were formally under iroquois rule , and were limited by them in authority to make agreements .
further south the southeast interior was dominated by siouan-speaking catawba , muskogee-speaking creek and choctaw , and the iroquoian-speaking cherokee tribes .
when war broke out , the french used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the great lakes region ( an area not directly subject to the conflict between the french and british ) , including the huron , mississauga , ojibwa , winnebago , and potawatomi .
the british were supported in the war by the iroquois six nations , and also by the cherokee – until differences sparked the anglo-cherokee war in 1758. in 1758 the pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the treaty of easton , in which a number of tribes in the ohio country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations .
at the start of the war , no french regular army troops were stationed in north america , and few british troops .
at the start of the war , no french regular army troops were stationed in north america , and few british troops .
most british colonies mustered local militia companies , generally ill trained and available only for short periods , to deal with native threats , but did not have any standing forces .
the expedition covered about 3,000 miles ( 4,800 km ) between june and november 1749. it went up the st. lawrence , continued along the northern shore of lake ontario , crossed the portage at niagara , and followed the southern shore of lake erie .
céloron 's expedition force consisted of about 200 troupes de la marine and 30 indians .
whenever he encountered british merchants or fur-traders , céloron informed them of the french claims on the territory and told them to leave .
when céloron 's expedition arrived at logstown , the native americans in the area informed céloron that they owned the ohio country and that they would trade with the british regardless of the french .
céloron continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the ohio and the miami rivers , which lay just south of the village of pickawillany , the home of the miami chief known as " old briton " .
céloron threatened " old briton " with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the british .
" old briton " ignored the warning .
in his extensively detailed report , céloron wrote , " all i can say is that the natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the french , and are entirely devoted to the english .
even before his return to montreal , reports on the situation in the ohio country were making their way to london and paris , each side proposing that action be taken .
william shirley , the expansionist governor of the province of massachusetts bay , was particularly forceful , stating that british colonists would not be safe as long as the french were present .
in 1749 the british government gave land to the ohio company of virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the ohio country .

in 1750 christopher gist , acting on behalf of both virginia and the company , explored the ohio territory and opened negotiations with the indian tribes at logstown .
he completed the 1752 treaty of logstown in which the local indians , through their " half-king " tanacharison and an iroquois representative , agreed to terms that included permission to build a " strong house " at the mouth of the monongahela river ( the site of present-day pittsburgh , pennsylvania ) .

the issues of conflicting territorial claims between british and french colonies in north america were turned over to a commission to resolve , but it reached no decision .
frontiers from between nova scotia and acadia in the north , to the ohio country in the south , were claimed by both sides .
on march 17 , 1752 , the governor-general of new france , marquis de la jonquière , died and was temporarily replaced by charles le moyne de longueuil .
langlade was given 300 men , including french-canadians and warriors of the ottawa .
his objective was to punish the miami people of pickawillany for not following céloron 's orders to cease trading with the british .
on june 21 , the french war party attacked the trading centre at pickawillany , capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the miami nation , including old briton .
in the spring of 1753 , paul marin de la malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of troupes de la marine and indians .
he first constructed fort presque isle ( near present-day erie , pennsylvania ) on lake erie 's south shore .
marin constructed a second fort at fort le boeuf ( present-day waterford , pennsylvania ) , designed to guard the headwaters of leboeuf creek .
his orders were to protect the king 's land in the ohio valley from the british .
tanaghrisson , a chief of the mingo , who were remnants of iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion .
the british superintendent for indian affairs in the new york region and beyond , johnson was known to the iroquois as warraghiggey , meaning " he who does great things . "

in 1746 , johnson was made a colonel of the iroquois .
mohawk chief hendrick , speaker of their tribal council , insisted that the british abide by their obligations and block french expansion .
governor robert dinwiddie of virginia was an investor in the ohio company , which stood to lose money if the french held their claim .
to counter the french military presence in ohio , in october 1753 dinwiddie ordered the 21-year-old major george washington ( whose brother was another ohio company investor ) of the virginia regiment to warn the french to leave virginia territory .
washington left with a small party , picking up along the way jacob van braam as an interpreter ; christopher gist , a company surveyor working in the area ; and a few mingo led by tanaghrisson .
on december 12 , washington and his men reached fort le boeuf .
jacques legardeur de saint-pierre , who succeeded marin as commander of the french forces after the latter died on october 29 , invited washington to dine with him .
over dinner , washington presented saint-pierre with the letter from dinwiddie demanding an immediate french withdrawal from the ohio country .
saint-pierre said , " as to the summons you send me to retire , i do not think myself obliged to obey it . "
he told washington that france 's claim to the region was superior to that of the british , since rené-robert cavelier , sieur de la salle had explored the ohio country nearly a century earlier .
governor duquesne sent additional french forces under claude-pierre pecaudy de contrecœur to relieve saint-pierre during the same period , and contrecœur led 500 men south from fort venango on april 5 , 1754. when these forces arrived at the fort on april 16 , contrecœur generously allowed trent 's small company to withdraw .
even before washington returned , dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under william trent to that point , where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small stockaded fort .
he purchased their construction tools to continue building what became fort duquesne .
learning of a french scouting party in the area , washington , with tanaghrisson and his party , surprised the canadians on may 28 in what became known as the battle of jumonville glen .
they killed many of the canadians , including their commanding officer , joseph coulon de jumonville , whose head was reportedly split open by tanaghrisson with a tomahawk .
the historian fred anderson suggests that tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the british and regain authority over his own people . they had been inclined to support the french , with whom they had long trading relationships .
after several months of negotiations , the government of the duke of newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the french .
word of the british military plans leaked to france well before braddock 's departure for north america .
in response , king louis xv dispatched six regiments to new france under the command of baron dieskau in 1755. the british , intending to blockade french ports , sent out their fleet in february 1755 , but the french fleet had already sailed .

an early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the albany congress in june and july , 1754. the goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various indians , since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding .

the plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown .
nevertheless , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the war of independence .
braddock ( with george washington as one of his aides ) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in june 1755 to take fort duquesne .
the expedition was a disaster .
approximately 1,000 british soldiers were killed or injured .
two future opponents in the american revolutionary war , washington and thomas gage , played key roles in organizing the retreat .
the french acquired a copy of the british war plans , including the activities of shirley and johnson .
shirley 's efforts to fortify oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , exacerbated by shirley 's inexperience in managing large expeditions .
in conjunction , shirley was made aware that the french were massing for an attack on fort oswego in his absence when he planned to attack fort niagara .
as a response , shirley left garrisons at oswego , fort bull , and fort williams ( the latter two located on the oneida carry between the mohawk river and wood creek at present-day rome , new york ) .
johnson 's expedition was better organized than shirley 's , which was noticed by new france 's governor , the marquis de vaudreuil .
when johnson was seen as the larger threat , vaudreuil sent dieskau to fort st. frédéric to meet that threat .
the battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field .
johnson 's advance stopped at fort william henry , and the french withdrew to ticonderoga point , where they began the construction of fort carillon ( later renamed fort ticonderoga after british capture in 1759 ) .

colonel monckton , in the sole british success that year , captured fort beauséjour in june 1755 , cutting the french fortress at louisbourg off from land-based reinforcements .
to cut vital supplies to louisbourg , nova scotia 's governor charles lawrence ordered the deportation of the french-speaking acadian population from the area .
other than the campaigns to expel the acadians ( ranging around the bay of fundy , on the petitcodiac and st. john rivers , and île saint-jean ) , the only clashes of any size were at petitcodiac in 1755 and at bloody creek near annapolis royal in 1757 .
following the death of braddock , william shirley assumed command of british forces in north america .
at a meeting in albany in december 1755 , he laid out his plans for 1756. in addition to renewing the efforts to capture niagara , crown point and duquesne , he proposed attacks on fort frontenac on the north shore of lake ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the maine district and down the chaudière river to attack the city of quebec .

newcastle replaced him in january 1756 with lord loudoun , with major general james abercrombie as his second in command .
french regular army reinforcements arrived in new france in may 1756 , led by major general louis-joseph de montcalm and seconded by the chevalier de lévis and colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , all experienced veterans from the war of the austrian succession .
during that time in europe , on may 18 , 1756 , england formally declared war on france , which expanded the war into europe , which was later to be known as the seven years ' war .
scouts had reported the weakness of the british supply chain , so he ordered an attack against the forts shirley had erected at the oneida carry .
in the march battle of fort bull , french forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder .
in the march battle of fort bull , french forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder .
they set back any british hopes for campaigns on lake ontario , and endangered the oswego garrison , already short on supplies .
when he arrived in albany , abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until loudoun approved them .
building on vaudreuil 's work harassing the oswego garrison , montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to ticonderoga , as if to presage another attack along lake george .
with abercrombie pinned down at albany , montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on oswego in august .
in the aftermath , montcalm and the indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners ' personal effects .
loudoun , a capable administrator but a cautious field commander , planned one major operation for 1757 : an attack on new france 's capital , quebec .
leaving a sizable force at fort william henry to distract montcalm , he began organizing for the expedition to quebec .
he was then ordered by william pitt , the secretary of state responsible for the colonies , to attack louisbourg first .
faced with this strength , loudoun returned to new york amid news that a massacre had occurred at fort william henry .
french irregular forces ( canadian scouts and indians ) harassed fort william henry throughout the first half of 1757. in january they ambushed british rangers near ticonderoga .
in february they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen lake george , destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification .
when the withdrawal began , some of montcalm 's indian allies , angered at the lost opportunity for loot , attacked the british column , killing and capturing several hundred men , women , children , and slaves .
vaudreuil and montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , as the british blockade of the french coastline limited french shipping .
the situation in new france was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 , a difficult winter , and the allegedly corrupt machinations of françois bigot , the intendant of the territory .
montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the st. lawrence , with primary defenses at carillon , quebec , and louisbourg , while vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years .
the british failures in north america , combined with other failures in the european theater , led to the fall from power of newcastle and his principal military advisor , the duke of cumberland .
he embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by loudoun .
he had been replaced by abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. pitt 's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops , supported by the provincial militias , aimed at capturing the heartlands of new france .
two of the expeditions were successful , with fort duquesne and louisbourg falling to sizable british forces .
the third invasion was stopped with the improbable french victory in the battle of carillon , in which 3,600 frenchmen famously and decisively defeated abercrombie 's force of 18,000 regulars , militia and native american allies outside the fort the french called carillon and the british called ticonderoga .

abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent john bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed fort frontenac , including caches of supplies destined for new france 's western forts and furs destined for europe .
abercrombie was recalled and replaced by jeffery amherst , victor at louisbourg .
in the aftermath of generally poor french results in most theaters of the seven years ' war in 1758 , france 's new foreign minister , the duc de choiseul , decided to focus on an invasion of britain , to draw british resources away from north america and the european mainland .
the invasion failed both militarily and politically , as pitt again planned significant campaigns against new france , and sent funds to britain 's ally on the mainland , prussia , and the french navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at lagos and quiberon bay .

british victories continued in all theaters in the annus mirabilis of 1759 , when they finally captured ticonderoga , james wolfe defeated montcalm at quebec ( in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders ) , and victory at fort niagara successfully cut off the french frontier forts further to the west and south .

the victory was made complete in 1760 when , despite losing outside quebec city in the battle of sainte-foy , the british were able to prevent the arrival of french relief ships in the naval battle of the restigouche while armies marched on montreal from three sides .

in september 1760 , and before any hostilities erupted , governor vaudreuil negotiated from montreal a capitulation with general amherst .
amherst granted vaudreuil 's request that any french residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their roman catholic tradition , continued ownership of their property , and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes .

the war in north america officially ended with the signing of the treaty of paris on 10 february 1763 , and war in the european theatre of the seven years ' war was settled by the treaty of hubertusburg on 15 february 1763. the british offered france the choice of surrendering either its continental north american possessions east of the mississippi or the caribbean islands of guadeloupe and martinique , which had been occupied by the british .

they viewed the economic value of the caribbean islands ' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent .
britain gained control of french canada and acadia , colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily french-speaking roman catholic residents .
the deportation of acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from europe and the colonies further south .
the british resettled many acadians throughout its north american provinces , but many went to france , and some went to new orleans , which they had expected to remain french .
others migrated to places like saint-domingue , and fled to new orleans after the haitian revolution .
following the treaty , king george iii issued the royal proclamation of 1763 on october 7 , 1763 , which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory , and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern canada and the first nations .

included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the appalachian mountains to its indian population , a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers .
most went to cuba , including the entire governmental records from st. augustine , although some christianized yamasee were resettled to the coast of mexico .
the ohio country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by braddock and forbes .
although the spanish takeover of the louisiana territory ( which was not completed until 1769 ) had modest repercussions , the british takeover of spanish florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the british , and a rise in tensions between the choctaw and the creek , historic enemies whose divisions the british at times exploited .

for many native populations , the elimination of french power in north america meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to british expansion , leading to their ultimate dispossession .
philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force .
a fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion , even at a constant velocity .
with his mathematical insight , sir isaac newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years .

by the early 20th century , einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia .
with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light , particle physics has devised a standard model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms .
the standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed .
only four main interactions are known : in order of decreasing strength , they are : strong , electromagnetic , weak , and gravitational .

:2–10:79 high-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction .
aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology .
aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology .
in aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different " natural places " therein .
aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone .
he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their " natural place " ( e.g. , for heavy bodies to fall ) , which led to " natural motion " , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force .
the shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of galileo galilei , who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus .

the shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of galileo galilei , who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus .
galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century .
he showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force , for example friction .
newton 's first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force .
this law is an extension of galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force ( see a more detailed description of this below ) .
newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium " natural state " in place of the aristotelian idea of the " natural state of rest " .
by making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity , newton 's first law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities .
in other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a galilean transformation .
for instance , while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity , the laws of physics do not change from being at rest .
this is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle .
from the perspective of the person in the car , the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest : it is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction .
inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest .
the concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion , even those that are not strictly constant velocity .
the rotational inertia of planet earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year .
albert einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration , such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object , were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames .
this is why , for example , astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the earth , and why newton 's laws of motion are more easily discernible in such environments .
this principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity .
newton 's second law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass .
accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements .
general relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass , but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity , it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales .

with some justification , newton 's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality ; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed .
newton 's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects .
newton 's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects .
the third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies , [ note 3 ] and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body .
f and −f are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction .
alternatively , if an external force acts on the system , then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system .
this means that in a closed system of particles , there are no internal forces that are unbalanced .
alternatively , if an external force acts on the system , then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system .
since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls , this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces .

through experimentation , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics .
through experimentation , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics .
because of these characteristics , forces are classified as " vector quantities " .
this means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction ( denoted scalar quantities ) .
associating forces with vectors avoids such problems .
if both of these pieces of information are not known for each force , the situation is ambiguous .
associating forces with vectors avoids such problems .
historically , forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out .
such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction .
when two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant ( also called the net force ) , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition : the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram .
however , if the forces are acting on an extended body , their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body .

as well as being added , forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other .
a horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces , one pointing north , and one pointing east .
summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force .
this is because , for orthogonal components , the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors .
orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two .
pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction , generated between the object and the table surface .
pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction , generated between the object and the table surface .
for a situation with no movement , the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration .
the static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object .
a static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces , using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances .
for example , an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the " spring reaction force " , which equals the object 's weight .
for example , an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the " spring reaction force " , which equals the object 's weight .
using such tools , some quantitative force laws were discovered : that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density ( widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights ) ; archimedes ' principle for buoyancy ; archimedes ' analysis of the lever ; boyle 's law for gas pressure ; and hooke 's law for springs .
these were all formulated and experimentally verified before isaac newton expounded his three laws of motion .
dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic .
galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest .
galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest .
thus , in an aristotelian universe , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship .
however , when this experiment is actually conducted , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it .
a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction .
in such a situation , a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force .
however , when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion .
aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force .
the notion " force " keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics , though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the schrödinger equation instead of newtonian equations .

however , the potentials v ( x , y , z ) or fields , from which the forces generally can be derived , are treated similar to classical position variables , i.e. , .
this has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes " quantized " , i.e .

however , already in quantum mechanics there is one " caveat " , namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable , but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the " spin " , and there is the pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables .

depending on the value of the spin , identical particles split into two different classes , fermions and bosons .
for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric ( i.e .
parallel spins ) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric ( i.e .
in modern particle physics , forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons .
with the development of quantum field theory and general relativity , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum ( 4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics ) .
the conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force .
while sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate result of such interactions , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of feynman diagrams .
in a feynman diagram , each matter particle is represented as a straight line ( see world line ) traveling through time , which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram .
all of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions .
the strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances , and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles , including nucleons and compound nuclei .
the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , and the gravitational force acts between masses .
the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , and the gravitational force acts between masses .
for example , friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces , and the pauli exclusion principle , which does not permit atoms to pass through each other .
for example , isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation .
in the 20th century , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces ( all except gravity ) are manifestations of matter ( fermions ) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons .
physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything .

what we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of isaac newton .
galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object .
today , this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the earth is usually designated as and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared ( this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location ) , and points toward the center of the earth .

this observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the earth 's surface is directly proportional to the object 's mass .
newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances .
in particular , newton determined that the acceleration of the moon around the earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law .
further , newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body .
combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass ( ) and the radius ( ) of the earth to the gravitational acceleration :
this constant has come to be known as newton 's universal gravitation constant , though its value was unknown in newton 's lifetime .
not until 1798 was henry cavendish able to make the first measurement of using a torsion balance ; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the earth since knowing could allow one to solve for the earth 's mass given the above equation .

newton , however , realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion , his law of gravity had to be universal .
it was only the orbit of the planet mercury that newton 's law of gravitation seemed not to fully explain .
some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet ( vulcan ) that would explain the discrepancies ; however , despite some early indications , no such planet could be found .
when albert einstein formulated his theory of general relativity ( gr ) he turned his attention to the problem of mercury 's orbit and found that his theory added a correction , which could account for the discrepancy .

since then , and so far , general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity .
thus , the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space , and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object .
the time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as " gravitational force " .
it is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object 's curved path .
through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge , a rule of vector multiplication called lorentz 's law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field .
the connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge .

this force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force ( due to the electric field ) and the magnetic force ( due to the magnetic field ) .
the origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations , which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs .

this led maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be " self-generating " through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light .
however , attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations , the photoelectric effect , and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe , proved troublesome .
through the work of leading theoretical physicists , a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics .
this final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics ( or qed ) , which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons .

it is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force .
however , these characteristics actually result from the pauli exclusion principle .
this means that it takes energy to pack them together .
while this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force , it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states .

the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles .
however , a residual of the force is observed between hadrons ( the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei ) as the nuclear force .

here the strong force acts indirectly , transmitted as gluons , which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons , which classically transmit the nuclear force ( see this topic for more ) .
this phenomenon is called color confinement .
the weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy w and z bosons .
its most familiar effect is beta decay ( of neutrons in atomic nuclei ) and the associated radioactivity .

the word " weak " derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force .
a consistent electroweak theory has also been developed , which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins .
the normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact .
when their electron clouds overlap , pauli repulsion ( due to fermionic nature of electrons ) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects .

:93 the normal force , for example , is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object .
tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless , frictionless , unbreakable , and unstretchable .
they can be combined with ideal pulleys , which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction .
ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string , any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object .
these tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine .
by connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys , the tension force on a load can be multiplied .
newton 's laws and newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects .

for example , in extended fluids , differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows :

the stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains ( deformations ) including also tensile stresses and compressions .
this formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area ( the matrix diagonals of the tensor ) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area ( the off-diagonal elements ) .

torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position , angular velocity for velocity , and angular momentum for momentum .
as a consequence of newton 's first law of motion , there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque .
likewise , newton 's second law of motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body :
this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path .
such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object , and therefore do not change the speed of the object ( magnitude of the velocity ) , but only the direction of the velocity vector .
this yields both the tangential force , which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up , and the radial ( centripetal ) force , which changes its direction .

a conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms .
a conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms .
this means that for a closed system , the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system .
the force , therefore , is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space , and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area .

for example , friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms , but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector .
nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces , tension , compression , and drag .
the connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics .
in macroscopic closed systems , nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system , and are often associated with the transfer of heat .
