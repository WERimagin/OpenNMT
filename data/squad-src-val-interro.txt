there are two known species , with worldwide distribution in warm , and warm-temperate waters : cestum veneris ( " venus ' girdle " ) is among the largest ctenophores – up to 1.5 meters ( 4.9 ft ) long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly . <SEP> what ?
the cestida ( " belt animals " ) are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon . <SEP> what ?
cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows . <SEP> how ?
velamen parallelum , which is typically less than 20 centimeters ( 0.66 ft ) long , can move much faster in what has been described as a " darting motion " . <SEP> which species ?
most platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction , with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface . <SEP> what ?
they cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular " foot " . <SEP> what ?
all but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows . <SEP> what ?
platyctenids are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current . <SEP> where ?
the gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis . <SEP> how ?
fertilization is external in most species , but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch . <SEP> how ?
self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus mnemiopsis , and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile . <SEP> what genus ?
the gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis . <SEP> where ?
in some groups , such as the flat , bottom-dwelling platyctenids , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis , after dropping to the sea-floor . <SEP> where ?

members of the cydippid genus pleurobrachia and the lobate bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey : pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae . <SEP> what ?
the two-tentacled " cydippid " lampea feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies , and juveniles of lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow . <SEP> what ?
ctenophores used to be regarded as " dead ends " in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals . <SEP> why ?
detailed investigation of chum salmon , oncorhynchus keta , showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps , and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around . <SEP> what ?
beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores . <SEP> what ?
this is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the red sea . <SEP> where ?
on the other hand , in the late 1980s the western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the black sea and sea of azov via the ballast tanks of ships , and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish . <SEP> what ?

mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the mnemiopsis-eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata , and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 , which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism . <SEP> how ?

however , other researchers have argued that the placement of ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that porifera ( sponges ) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead . <SEP> what ?
since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae , it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids , having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles . <SEP> which genus of ctenophores ?
this suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished . <SEP> when ?
richard harbison 's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid . <SEP> who ?
