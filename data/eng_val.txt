Tom was stabbed in the chest.
I find you intriguing.
I'm not at all busy.
I told you not to come here.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
They attributed his bad manners to lack of training in childhood.
I'm no liar.
While she was staying in Japan, she often visited Kyoto.
Frankly speaking, I don't like the idea.
A new year always brings hope.
She is older and wiser now.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
I'll teach you what you need to know.
It's a dictionary.
The sales of this model took off.
Tom, may I have some money?
Tom can do it.
I don't like being on my own.
I'll talk to him at the earliest possible moment.
The line is busy.
I returned the books I borrowed from the library, and I borrowed some new ones.
He went to the hospital yesterday.
You've got to be bold!
If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car.
We should make something like that.
You need to leave.
I was very hungry.
As soon as he felt his house shake, he rushed out into the garden.
Tom was caught selling drugs to kids.
Providing energy to the poor without destroying the planet any further is this century's biggest challenge.
You can't blame her for not knowing what she hasn't been taught.
You need to save the princess.
We have two dogs, three cats, and six chickens.
Will you ever forgive me?
The bathtub needs to be cleaned.
How did you vote on that matter?
Why are all these people here?
You're upset.
You've put on a little weight, haven't you?
Advertising sells products over the air.
We'll talk about that later.
I could be of help.
How's that again?
Do you feel lucky?
He reached his goal.
I can't tell you where Tom lives.
Have you seen my son?
I'm in love with you.
Would you say it once more?
Don't forget to take your pills.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to listen to my opinion.
They'll eat those.
She had her tooth pulled.
I felt like an outcast among those people.
Beware of pickpockets here.
I don't have money, but I have dreams.
That baby is fat and healthy.
I feel homesick.
I'm done.
It's new.
That's right.
I don't believe you anymore.
Could you give me some advice?
Everyone is suffering.
Are you implying something?
I really don't want to talk about it.
I know exactly how it was.
I promise I'll be quiet.
I'm too old for you.
We'll find a way to use it.
I kicked the dog.
We're looking forward to your being here.
You're depressed, aren't you?
Could you tell me how to get to your office?
He is inclined to look at everything from the standpoint of its practicality and is neither stingy nor extravagant.
Be sure to turn out the light when you go out.
You should get some exercise.
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
I can't sing as well as Mary did.
He sat next to her.
We persuaded him not to go.
I figured you'd be impressed.
You can all help.
She introduced the lady to me.
These cameras are made in Japan.
Don't touch me, you pig!
I got off lightly.
You're the only person I can trust.
Go away before they see you here.
Pleased to meet you.
This watch is made in Japan.
Are you tired of living?
It is dangerous for you to swim in this river.
I went fishing with Tom.
Tom gave up smoking.
I have to talk to you alone.
She has shown her room to me.
Do you have any idea how important your test grades are?
I can't believe he kissed you.
I took the elevator to the third floor.
She was always telephoning me.
She is peeling the potatoes.
Breakfast is served.
I sort of like him.
We're in the process of writing the report now.
My daughter caught a cold.
I want to go fishing.
I must tell you something.
I speak a little Spanish.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
Let Tom answer.
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends.
Which hat do you want to buy?
This room is too small for us.
If it had not been for your advice, I could not have succeeded.
That's the book I bought yesterday.
I promise you I'll stay with you until your father arrives.
She has fallen in love with me.
I was unable to attend the party, nor did I want to.
I am out of time.
All you have to do is to obey my orders.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
Tom asked for a raise.
I like swimming very much.
She wouldn't speak to him.
You decide.
Tom's lost a lot of blood, but he hasn't lost consciousness.
I don't understand art.
I repeated my name.
I've got to get back to work.
What does she think of it?
I no longer want to visit Boston.
Where do you work now?
They laughed.
Open your eyes.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I'm twice your age.
It's no big deal.
He's the only one who survived.
Maybe Tom was trying to warn us about something.
You're embarrassing me.
You may not be as lucky next time.
I always have to wear a tie because of my job.
He wrote about plants and trees.
This book is worth reading again.
I figured out a way to make more money.
He is a bit of a coward.
Don't ask me for money.
I want to return your money.
I want to quit.
I believe you are honest.
I want a scooter.
I'm a musician.
Explain it to me.
He will be delighted to see you.
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
They lied.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
Because of the rain, we weren't able to play tennis outside.
It's getting there.
She is a reliable person.
They arrived too soon.
I'm not all that smart.
Something is wrong with this calculator.
Do you think I'm ugly?
I met him in January.
You ought not to miss it.
I was falsely accused.
You are responsible for this accident.
He painted his bicycle red.
I reconsidered your offer.
Would you like to dance?
That's as good a place as any.
Being handsome also has its downside.
Do what he tells you.
I pretended it didn't happen.
I'm not delusional.
Everyone knows me.
How long do you have to eat lunch?
Please take care of my dog while I am away.
They slept in the same room.
It's an ill wind that blows no good.
I think it's time for me to ask for directions.
I'm going to study for the final exams this afternoon.
I was just making a suggestion.
What do you say we go to my house?
You're a traitor.
I don't want to see you.
Hang on a minute.
If there's anything you want to do, you should do it.
I think we're going to be late.
You're not as smart as me.
You don't need to answer that question.
That's fantastic news.
Tom could do with some help.
That's very thoughtful of you.
He is my old friend.
That's one of ours.
Life is more interesting than any book.
Finishing the job by Tuesday will be a piece of cake.
That would appear to be correct.
How did you come by this painting?
I don't have to go right away.
I take vitamins.
Are you the owner of this house?
My uncle has three children.
I only wish I could return the favor.
She is curious to find who sent the flowers.
He begged his father to buy him a bicycle.
She urged him to drive carefully.
When did you two start dating?
We didn't know which car we should get in.
Don't you ever say that again.
I beg you to help me.
Do you have a cheaper room?
May I put it here?
You don't know why Tom didn't come yesterday, do you?
I hope you two are very happy together.
I think you should listen to me.
She tied him to the chair.
Who drives better, your father or your mother?
Tom asked Mary if she'd like a cup of coffee.
Your effort will surely bear fruit.
The new house didn't live up to expectations.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
His story moved her to tears.
They did not know it was impossible, so they did it.
Do you think he will like that?
I want to be with Tom.
She tells him to give her all of his salary and he does.
Where's the entrance?
I've always wanted to try it.
That was our plan.
Send me a new catalog.
Find somebody else.
How would you like your steak?
I thought you'd gone and left me.
How many times do you have to go to the dentist?
I thought you were kidding.
He died of a heart attack.
Facebook is blocked in China.
I don't really want to talk about this now.
It's not your style.
Not knowing what to do, I asked for help.
Did you buy flowers?
You're conceited.
You're punctual.
They were both drunk.
A rabbit has long ears.
My father gave me a game.
Meet me in the lobby.
I can speak Chinese.
We're nearly finished.
If you behave like a flunkey, you're treated like a flunkey.
I know you did your best.
He blames his failure on bad luck.
Tell Tom he has to do everything Mary asks him to do.
Can you understand the meaning of this sentence?
I hate that you have to leave.
We are glad to help you.
She is his friend.
My phone was out of order.
I answered your questions. Now let me ask you a few.
He disagrees with his relatives.
Please come into the room.
I am sorry. I am not from here.
The contestant made two false starts.
We need to keep this confidential.
Are you avoiding me?
They finished their meal.
Tom is really shy, isn't he?
You are deceiving yourself.
The number of members will grow quickly.
I don't know what that is.
The pain went away because I took the pills.
You should not give him up for lost.
Tom pressed his ear against the wall.
I believe this is mine.
He was too stunned to talk.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
Can I make a couple of suggestions?
You must be very busy these days.
The princess begged forgiveness from the emperor.
I advise you to be punctual.
We want change.
I have such bad luck.
I may be old, but I'm not crazy.
We tried our best.
This is going to be the hottest summer in thirty-six years.
I've misjudged you.
How can you say such a foolish thing?
I'm not all that drunk.
I'm pleased with his performance.
The policeman arrested the thief.
God can be found everywhere.
They should have arrived home by now.
Let's pray.
Let's meet up for a drink later.
This book contains forty photographs.
Tom poured milk into a bowl for his cat.
That's how he invented the machine.
Are you as tall as me?
Can I take a picture of you?
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
You must be very hungry now.
I was raised right.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
Which one of those is yours?
I wasn't aware that someone was watching me.
I remember now.
This is appalling.
I waited until the last minute.
Do you have an appointment?
We need action.
I wish we could settle this like adults.
We lost.
We agreed.
This is the house where I lived when I was a child.
I'm frantic.
We'll have little snow this winter.
Do I look happy to you?
Why did you agree to help them?
I am in favor of your proposal.
Maybe Tom has had an accident.
How lucky you are!
My car is now being repaired.
He has been sick in bed this past week.
We invited him to the party, but he did not show up.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
She's adorable.
We still have a lot of food left.
Don't you just hate this kind of movie?
I wonder if he enjoyed the last match.
I kind of messed up.
He asked me where she lived.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
Tom could never make me laugh the way you do.
Whose handbag is this?
Hand in your papers.
The street lights went on.
The radio is too loud. Can't you turn it down a little?
That's something I've always wanted.
I wish Tom would spend more time at home.
I'd like to have a little talk with you.
You aren't my mother.
I'm a beginner, too.
You were nodding off at times during my lecture.
You've turned up at the right moment.
This picture reminds me of when I was a student.
I wish there were a more modern translation of this book.
It's been nice meeting you.
I am looking for a job, sir.
What do you think I should write?
I'll support him.
Are you relaxed?
That species of bird is said to be in danger of dying out.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
We've got a situation here, you know.
I'll explain how to take this medicine.
Do you want your old job back?
I speak English every day.
Read it to me.
She displayed her talents.
It's all total nonsense.
I have just what you need.
This old coat has had it.
That's just what I need right now.
I'll wait here until he comes back.
She drives me mad.
You're arrogant.
Do you have any cash?
There's nothing to be scared of.
These are marshmallows.
I can't go with you.
None of the money is mine.
I wasn't able to come because of the rain.
Just sign here.
We must cut down our expenses.
Where do I get the subway?
I've known it all along.
He has no chance of recovering.
The boy fell off the bicycle and fractured his skull.
Shall I draw a map for you?
He is a good match for me in tennis.
We had known him for five years when he died.
This form must be filled out in triplicate.
I'll finish it as quickly as I can.
The church's steeple is beginning to crumble with age.
Are you home?
I took the elevator to the third floor.
Who's in control?
You don't have to lie.
We solved that problem in a week.
She found employment as a typist.
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.
Will six o'clock suit you?
Let Tom do his job.
He is a psychic.
Is it OK to drink alcoholic drinks in this park?
"How old are you?" "I'm 16 years old."
It's awfully cold this evening.
Tom refused to sign the document.
You're bright.
I've never had a friend like you before.
I want to bring my family here.
I feel terrific.
Where can I leave my bike?
I failed the tests.
He finally fulfilled my request.
She ignored all my warnings.
You are liable for the debt.
Are you still in the job?
If you could manage to go camping with us, we'd be delighted.
Sweet dreams!
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof.
They brush their teeth twice a day.
You must reboot your computer.
He makes mountains out of molehills.
It is certain that he will pass the examination.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
Is there space for one more person?
Tom seems really happy to be here.
You should start as early as you can.
Tom will be back next week.
He's a fine young lad.
Tom and Mary sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
It's a dreary place.
We eat many kinds of food.
Draw me a seven-pointed star.
History repeats itself.
I want to change my shirt.
Pay very close attention.
We left the final decision to him.
It was a good day.
I'm not sure what you were thinking.
I'm glad you liked it.
The cat was lying stretched out at full length in the sunlight streaming through the window.
Let me reiterate what I've said.
I don't feel like it.
I gave him the book.
They're babies.
You're a terrible dancer.
He is apt to forget.
He was given the benefit of the doubt.
No matter what you do, do your best.
This car needs to be washed.
I think you're nuts.
Tom leaned over the bridge.
What kind of game are you playing?
I have no proof to the contrary.
I appreciate anything you can do.
He fought until the end.
Have you read the leading article in today's paper?
I never realized how much I would miss you.
I'm broke and tired.
She gave birth to twin girls.
Tom won't eat.
We were told by him to leave the room at once.
I started this topic.
Tom takes the trash out every day at six o'clock.
I've never been in love before.
She is out of danger.
Isn’t love supposed to last forever?
Let's pull an all-nighter.
I found it difficult to please her.
There are no roses without thorns.
I understand the risks.
He gets a reasonable salary as a bank clerk.
Apparently, not much has changed.
That is how it happened.
I think we should stick together.
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
This is your fate.
We need authorization.
Our dog buries bones in the garden.
We take it for granted that he will succeed in his business.
Where did you go to school?
I was late for school this morning.
Are you happy?
I got up about five.
Do I look tired?
I notice the sale prices are written in red ink.
He has a new woman in his life.
I tried to protect you.
Leave this to me.
What are the symptoms?
I have no regrets.
I think I'm in love.
Don't you see who's following us?
Did I wake you up?
I have to lose weight, so I'm on a diet.
I wish you could stay the night.
It was not my intention to hurt your feelings.
I thought I'd find you here.
Last night, we looked at the stars from the rooftop.
We're not cops.
She doesn't like soccer.
Tom is taking a walk.
He thought maybe this was a trick.
That's how I feel right now.
I told her not to let go of the rope, but she did.
Please refrain from smoking here.
Say hello to your father for me.
I needed to justify why I was earning such a large salary.
Don't expose it to the rain.
I was stung by a bee.
What time is it by your watch?
There are various kinds of coffee.
I just don't understand you.
You will die.
May I ask you some more questions?
Don't just stand there.
I was as surprised as you.
She's painting her room white.
Please show me your notebook.
He got bogged down at work.
Tom is taking good care of himself.
You're just like your father.
The fruit is in the basket.
I thought that book was difficult to read.
She saw me enter the store.
I don't like the look of it.
We must attack.
I do not understand her.
He cares about no one, but himself.
I already have an envelope.
Listen.
You're a little liar.
The rent is due tomorrow.
It's no use kidding myself.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
How did you become involved in this project?
It didn't work for me either.
A yard is equal to three feet.
Do I have to pay you?
We are not amused.
A piece of bread was not enough to satisfy his hunger.
I remember the first time we met.
I think you deserve more than this.
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.
You'd do the same for me.
I didn't take the time to do it properly.
Tom hates his life.
We're not friends anymore.
The house caught fire.
You should make good use of your time.
I enjoy taking pictures.
You might want some of this.
Everyone is trying his best.
You can go wherever you want to go.
We've been warned.
Tom's big-headed.
Can you show me?
How many hours do you normally work?
This will be a great opportunity.
I have a good dictionary.
Who is that old woman?
How much were the glasses?
Maybe you can help us.
You don't have the qualifications to lead a group.
Turn left.
I stretched out my legs.
Are you writing a letter?
I don't notice any difference.
There was a small box inside the big box.
For a moment, he thought of going after the man.
You and I have the same idea.
She accused me of being a liar.
You're starting to sound like your old man.
They plan to have a party.
Tom lost his hearing.
I feel good after a workout.
I hear you were grounded.
You've got to be bold!
Some animals can sense the coming of a storm.
What're you talking about?
Is Tom there, too?
These two have very little in common.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
I thought Tom was going to take us to see Mary.
I am a volunteer.
Tom is merciless.
We're escaping.
We often come across Japanese tourists in this area.
Cats like boxes.
Why didn't you call me last night?
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
He looks just like his father.
Do you know me?
I'm still your friend.
I've heard of you.
Have you really already found a new job?
It is useless to try to remember all the words in the dictionary.
Study hard, and you'll succeed.
How do you come up with such interesting plots for your novels?
You are our one millionth customer.
He can't be an honest man.
Tom sang better than Mary did.
They're about to leave.
Close the gate.
You don't need that.
I opened the drawer.
I want to play cards.
Do you know about that?
The doctor told me to eat fewer high-calorie snacks.
Why is everyone looking at us?
She has a big family.
He died before the ambulance arrived.
I remember when I was about your age.
I checked twice to make certain we hadn't made any mistakes.
Do you often hear from him?
You must be very special.
We've all been there.
It isn't easy to understand his ideas.
You can't park your car here.
He has long legs.
I'm truthful.
He was found mysteriously murdered.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Would you like more mashed potatoes?
Tom is always joking.
I looked in the window.
Don't raise my hopes like that.
He's looking at you.
Will you please come with me?
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
I went to school on foot in those days.
I must go.
She walked up to him and asked him what his name was.
She never told me.
I slept very well last night.
I need to warn my mom.
My children like school.
Did you enjoy yourself?
The job is almost done.
Is she so stupid that she believes such a thing?
You don't have to go there.
He's not married.
I wish I earned more money.
I want to drive.
Anything you say may be used against you.
I really didn't care.
Save your long-winded explanations for someone else.
I would have told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you know where I live?
This is the same type of car as my father has.
I was naive.
I'm not so lucky.
We were beaten.
Would you like to sing?
Which kind of watch do you prefer, digital or analog?
The gate is closed at eight.
All inventions grow out of necessity.
There's nothing I can do.
I wish I wasn't such an idiot.
What woke you up?
Do you know your size?
Tom, I've got a surprise for you.
The U.S. incarceration rate is the highest in the world.
I'm running out of closet space.
The door needs another coat of paint.
I apologize if I offended you.
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
You'll never guess what happened to me today.
Do you know how to speak English?
I like spending time with you.
Where is the nearest supermarket?
All you have to do is to wait.
That's all we're offering.
Do you have enough money?
Does that mean you won't come?
We partied all night long.
We got your message.
I'm sorry, but I don't have any small change.
I'm ambidextrous.
No one could deny this.
There are many words that I don't understand.
I have never fed my dog a banana.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will leave Boston.
I don't know why it didn't work.
The train station will be closed from tomorrow.
I can understand your point of view.
Telling lies is a very bad habit.
Has your dog ever bitten you?
Are you on your way home?
Between you and me, I think our boss is stupid.
London is among the world's largest cities.
Wait. I want to tell you something.
I'm looking forward to that.
We're in charge.
He went to a single-sex school.
He is not religious.
Do as you like.
Repeat after me.
I'm glad I make you happy.
My father is too stubborn to admit his faults.
I don't care for that sort of thing.
I remember when I first saw you.
You'll have a rough time.
You're hurting him.
His mother was a singer.
I can feel it.
What do they do with all their leisure time?
I'm Italian.
I was just about to go to bed.
You're an interesting girl.
Do you have a twin brother?
Tom is older than I am.
I just want to talk to you.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
Which language do you use when you speak to your parents?
Let's see if Tom can help.
Yes, I'm a student too.
A leap year has three hundred and sixty-six days.
I know something you don't.
Even though it's small, it's still a great car.
I found the broken camera.
I'm just worried about my weight.
You're not that old.
Tom promised to tell the truth.
I'm not an only child.
Where on earth have you been?
Be merciful.
He asked a question about it.
English and German are two related languages.
We're both single.
The reason for your failure is that you did not try hard enough.
I'd rather do this alone.
I swallowed a bug.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
Is it that urgent?
I don't usually have to work on Sundays.
This is how I learned English.
That shouldn't be too hard to do.
Driving relaxes me.
You don't understand.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
Long story short, I was fired.
This is my office.
We can't go back there.
You might as well just enjoy life.
I need to get started now.
When you've finished reading that book, I'd like to read it.
Are you aware of what's happened?
Tom is a fast learner.
You're so sweet.
He saw the surprise on my face.
They're in the shower.
I can play the guitar.
I don't think Tom will believe Mary.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I was watching TV at this time yesterday.
Her wish is to study abroad someday.
I just want to finish this and leave.
I need thread to sew on this button.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Does he want to look at it?
Don't make me leave.
He is afraid of his father.
I have written down his phone number.
I didn't want to do this in the first place.
I'll tell you exactly what to say.
I am not ready yet.
Are we all happy?
Would you get me a glass of water?
Is it your fault or ours?
I make you nervous, don't I?
All at once, I heard a cry.
Why can't you do it?
They don't know yet.
He wanted to know more about the flowers.
They're downstairs.
I stayed at home because I was sick.
You don't sound very optimistic.
A car has one steering wheel.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
He made a little statue out of soft clay.
All was silent in the house.
Who's the next person on your list?
You don't have to apologize.
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
That's not quite what I meant.
I thought you'd left.
I'm not very happy, either.
Let's leave as soon as he gets back.
I want to go back to my quarters.
What are you doing?
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
A car hit Tom.
I won't do that unless you want me to.
I thought we had an understanding.
We discussed it last night.
It's still snowing.
Could somebody please open the door?
Where are you going to go?
I know why you're here.
Are you still at work?
I hope you can be a better father than I was.
I don't remember that at all.
What you did was wrong.
You're reliable.
I can't put up with the inconvenience of country life.
I suppose it might work.
They said you were fired.
I don't really have a gun.
Are you good at tennis?
She liked that.
I can't think of his name just now.
Tom seems to be unwilling to lower the price.
How many times a day do you look at yourself in the mirror?
It was all your imagination.
I'm sneaky.
I met him on the street by chance.
The boys were as nervous as the girls.
A man who wanted to see you came while you were out.
Are you lying to me?
I want to show you something very special.
I have not been busy for two days.
Why don't you get a job?
I have no one to help me.
What did you do on your vacation?
Tom can't see us.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
I'm going to miss you a lot.
I can handle this.
He was holding a pen in his hand.
Keep looking.
As soon as I got home, the telephone rang.
I'm not trying to say anything.
Tom was here a minute ago.
What exactly is this?
He made up a story about the dog.
She parted from her friend in tears.
Tom took three deep breaths.
They drive on the left in England.
Please turn it on.
I cut myself.
That's not my car.
What exactly do you want us to do?
He came to ask us to help him.
We were not to blame for the accident.
Happy is the man who is content with his lot.
She's unfit for the job.
Tom often cuts class.
I think that he's probably not a bad boy.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Everyone is friendly to her.
I know you considered me a close friend.
She could not keep her daughter from going out.
There were no consequences.
I need your passport and three pictures.
Choose whichever you like.
Tom tightened the knot.
Gas was escaping from a crack in the pipe.
She has about 2,000 books.
You must make allowance for his lack of experience.
I'll monitor your progress from my computer.
Your cat will survive.
I have a clear memory of my childhood.
I just thought that you wouldn't want to go.
What a pretty girl!
Where's your captain?
I arrived in Tokyo at noon.
I had a good time, too.
I only hope it is not too late.
I am thinking of going to the mountains.
Let's act like we're foreigners.
What would you say if you were in my place?
Give me a hammer.
Look after Tom.
Your composition is the best yet.
I don't feel safe here.
You are no longer welcome here.
I live in Milan.
We left Boston at 2:30 yesterday.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to need some help.
I said so.
The house stank.
The allegations they made were unfounded.
Tom does it very well.
You can trust him with any job.
What's done is done.
I wish I had eaten at that restaurant before it burned down.
I am free from care.
We are badly in want of water.
Those who know him speak well of him.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
Well, what does that tell you?
He doesn't want it.
The parking lot is empty.
Let's get this over with.
Is this seat vacant?
Can you carve the chicken?
You can't do it by yourself.
A long piece of thread easily becomes tangled up.
I'd like to believe you.
You remind me of somebody.
Which shoes are you going to put on?
You want something from me, don't you?
The police think the burglar entered through a basement window.
The thieves opened the door with a pass key.
It is pretty warm today.
Will you join us?
My older sister was grounded for coming home too late last night.
Are you sure they can do this?
It's as simple as that.
We were disappointed.
We're having dinner.
I'm not hungry either.
All our teachers were young and loved teaching.
We caught you.
You're right, of course.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
Most girls think that they are pretty.
There was little sugar left in the pot.
I wonder if maybe I should go.
What do you have in your bag?
I used to do that as a kid.
There are various ways to get to her house.
I like milk.
That man is completely drunk.
He drank a cup of coffee.
I needed to meet you.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
You can't handle this alone.
We're the owners.
You ought to see a dentist.
She has her faults, but I like her.
I never thought about it before.
She wished to punish only those responsible.
I owe what I am today to my parents.
I have something to show you.
That house is famous.
Children often do stupid things.
I did what I had to do.
As a matter of fact, he was convinced.
I sometimes skate.
He has the least money of us all.
We eat more processed food than natural food.
I arrived later than usual.
I need to be left alone.
Tom will be back next week.
I can't win.
He threatened me, but I wasn't scared.
Where are you living now?
He did not speak unless spoken to.
I fell asleep listening to music.
You're not that old.
I thought it was Tom.
Turn down the music.
You don't want to be late for practice.
She's been severely traumatized by bullying at school.
I will wait outside.
He sat next to her.
These two leaves look alike.
There was once a time when I could not trust others.
What street do you live on?
Bring a shovel.
A chance like this only comes along once in a blue moon.
I didn't know that he was there.
Are you hurt?
It's his first time.
How could it not bother you?
Let's get divorced.
If it were not for his idleness, he would be a nice fellow.
That's not exactly what I meant to say.
I think we should all go outside.
She surprised him when she arrived early.
Is it the right place to sign up for foreign language courses?
How can you even ask that question?
I don't need an answer right now.
Eat your vegetables.
Where did the bee sting you?
He was in the right place at the right time.
I'm looking for my cellphone.
I want to apologize to all of you for what just happened.
This machine is familiar to me.
They accused him of being dishonest.
Do you think we should abandon ship?
She thanked him for his help.
Put it down.
Who's your girlfriend?
We're finished.
The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
Where will you be this time tomorrow?
We were concerned.
What did you hear?
Tom is going to do something about it.
She is coming home at the end of this month.
My grandmother passed away peacefully last night.
Whose book is this?
He is careful about his manners.
We must wait.
They smell bad.
I've already tried that once.
When angry, count to four. When very angry, swear.
They are not enemies, but friends.
A red dress made her stand out.
They ruined my life.
Which of you came here first?
Strike while the iron is hot.
As you can see, I haven't done any cleaning in the house for some time.
I'm right in the middle of doing something.
You can't handle it.
Is this a duty-free shop?
Tom hasn't bought his ticket yet.
I agreed to split the money with Tom.
Tom looked a bit puzzled.
Have you gone over the lesson?
Please look for it.
It was difficult to persuade him to change his mind.
Do not say such foolish things.
What does this stand for?
The commander refused to negotiate.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
I thought you might want this back.
Please go to the bank.
It's great to meet you.
When I was your age, I was already married.
Is it damaged?
I want the truth from you.
Take a wild guess.
I'm going back inside.
While driving, mind the potholes.
Why don't you sit here?
I had to see you.
I seldom make mistakes.
I am ashamed of my son's laziness.
He betrayed you.
It's a matter of national pride.
That idea's not bad.
The dictionary is on the desk.
They talk all the time.
The light suddenly went out.
I really have to think about this a bit more.
I don't know if I should tell you.
She turned down our proposal.
She fell on her face.
We're finished.
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
Your birthday is coming soon.
Opposition to the bill was strong.
Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Did you practice the piano this morning?
Meet me at the hotel bar.
The robber ran away when the policeman saw him.
Tom is a bit short for his age.
I don't like being told what to do.
I don't belong to any club.
He denied that he was the thief.
How do you do this?
Women like colorful umbrellas.
You are incredibly naive.
I don't want you two talking about me.
They don't look happy to see us.
Everyone's dead.
The ground seems wet.
I thought you were Tom's friend.
I will telephone you later on.
I was sick.
Tom is watering the flowers.
You are in part responsible for it.
I'm your friend.
That's no exaggeration.
Tom isn't good at hiding his emotions.
Maybe he likes you, too.
I can't imagine what you've gone through.
I can't find the address of my hotel.
She gave him all the money that she had.
Tom said that he feels like going out.
I made these boxes myself.
Who are you talking about?
We swam in the sea.
Don't stop until I tell you.
Do you have any other questions about the matter?
You don't need to be nervous.
Let's grab a quick lunch at that small coffeeshop near the park.
She put me in a delicate situation.
I've been bitten by mosquitos all over my arm.
We considered the problem from all angles.
You gotta get more organized.
Just be quiet.
Do you have many friends here in Japan?
Do you mind if I tag along?
We're Canadians.
I'd like a little privacy.
He died in his bed.
Leave that box where it is.
The airport is closed.
You may or may not win.
No one will ever find you.
He acted like a madman.
He got off the bus.
They're boring.
I was accused of eating the boss's lunch.
Tom sealed the deal.
His daughter, as well as his son, was famous.
My nose was very runny.
I want everything to work out just right.
I hope you understand that.
Where's the nearest museum?
Don't tell your dad.
Man has a great capacity to adapt to environmental changes.
That's your opinion.
Tom handed Mary a cup of hot coffee.
She looked at him and knew that he was angry.
They married when they were young.
Are you finished?
It's 99.9% effective.
By the way, have you heard from her since then?
Somebody's inside the house.
I cannot drive a bus.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
How do we know that?
We are going to have a party on Saturday night.
I really can't do that.
He never takes me out for dinner.
I need to lose five pounds.
What did you drink?
They disappeared.
He was accused of stealing money.
It is preferable that he gets there by tomorrow.
This will not cost too much.
Everyone looked puzzled.
I figured I had enough money.
Tom claims he knows nothing about Mary.
I don't know what to answer.
You need a job.
We were very excited.
I bet you're hungry.
She has never fallen in love.
I can no longer find the Vivendi file.
The rain made me late.
Mary is beautiful, isn't she?
You must make an effort to get along with everyone.
That was no ordinary storm.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
You never arrive on time.
I told Tom he made a mistake.
That poor family survives on food stamps.
I was forced to drink against my will.
Don't they drive you mad?
He thinks that blue is the most beautiful color.
He loved me, but he doesn't love me anymore.
I am starting this evening.
I can't forget his kindness.
Tom burst out laughing.
We should respect our parents.
The balloon floated down the street.
I thought I wouldn't know the answers.
He accomplishes whatever he sets out to do.
I usually walk to school.
That's what we were told.
I have homework to finish.
They kept drinking.
Tom doesn't remember turning off the light.
It wouldn't hurt.
What she says sounds strange.
What was it that brought you to me?
Tom learned sign language.
This watch was your grandfather's.
You said it wasn't going to happen.
You need to grow up.
The bottom 40% of the U.S. population has only 0.3% of the wealth.
Without you, I would've died.
Open the door, please.
I will choose one of them.
Is it OK if I kiss you?
I'm not naive.
He can't be ill.
They're going to have a look.
Roses smell good.
They're clean.
It's inadequate.
To his surprise, the door opened by itself.
I am in the house.
You will always be in my heart.
All the exams are now behind us.
I promise you I'll stay with you until your father arrives.
I can remember the warmth of her hands.
My association with them didn't last long.
Sometimes water becomes a precious commodity.
Have you ever seen a tiger around here?
I must return his call.
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
Napoleon marched his armies into Russia.
They were taken prisoner.
Don't I get a goodbye kiss?
How did I miss this?
Recently, many people are finding it hard to make a decent living.
Each of the three boys got a prize.
I didn't sleep.
He's a tennis player.
He was just behind me.
I'm not happy with this situation.
This is all rubbish.
Tom asked me to give you a message.
I'll help you pack.
I'm dying to see you.
Tom is competitive.
Did you lend any money to my brother?
I will call you in an hour.
How can you be so cruel?
He made her a bookshelf.
I didn't bring this topic up with her.
Where did you get that scar?
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
I just want you to be OK.
We stayed at a nice hotel.
You do not have to take your umbrella with you.
You are too young to travel alone.
Tom won't be successful.
Tom says he won't come to our party.
I give up. No matter what I do, you never seem to be satisfied.
Tom doesn't know anything about it.
His father disapproved of him.
I was quite shocked by this.
Tom drank a lot last night and is a bit hung over this morning.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
I'm hanging a picture of my grandmother on the wall.
I'll give you back the money tomorrow.
I want you to follow orders.
I got up earlier than usual to catch the first train.
He's getting more and more stubborn with age.
I took part in the discussion.
Washing the car took longer than we expected.
This tie goes well with the suit, I guess.
I cannot lift this stone.
They were surprised by what they saw.
She tried to persuade him to go with her.
Where were you all night?
I bought the car at a 10% discount.
Where do you want these suitcases?
The train had already left when we got to station.
Have you met him already?
I just got a little carried away.
I knew this day would come.
The context is important.
So what else is new?
Tom pointed out my mistake.
I was completely shocked.
Why don't you go ahead?
How do they seem to you?
He went to bed.
They left the movie early.
Stay here and wait for him.
Which program did you watch yesterday?
Let's talk to Tom about that.
Where's everyone going?
I can't believe that she did that to me.
It's very likely that he'll be late.
I hope to return soon.
I have nothing left to lose.
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground.
He's obsessed with cleanliness.
Can you see Tom?
Since this is important, I'd like you to attend to it yourself.
Don't rush.
I hadn't planned to tell you about what happened last night.
We had to stop.
At what time did the show finish?
I didn't ask you to come with us.
Don't judge a man by his clothes.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
My birthday is October 20th.
If you don't behave, Santa won't come.
You're the most important person in my life.
Did you hurt yourself?
I met him at the end of the platform.
Keep your hands off my daughter!
Show me where it happened.
I am drinking coffee.
She visits him twice a year.
I was homeless for three months.
We'll get you back home immediately.
I hope we achieve that.
Don't leave the water running.
Her hair comes to her shoulders.
I no longer live here.
This is her handbag.
I did my homework yesterday.
You're incredibly talented.
Whose bicycle did you want to borrow?
I don't want to work today.
He postponed leaving for Hokkaido until next month.
This road follows the shoreline for the next thirty kilometers.
This sword is in fair condition.
Suicide is an act of desperation.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
I don't live around here.
I don't like this jacket.
I had to see you.
The town was full of activity.
I had to look after you.
I must help her at any cost.
That is my sister's camera.
The king reigned over his people for forty years.
What'll you do if someone sees you?
Can you drive a car?
You owe me one.
What do you know?
I packed your suitcase for you.
Have you ever seen such a beautiful sunset?
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
I said don't do that.
Between us, he is a little foolish.
I hate it when I have to sit between two fat guys on a plane.
Shut your mouth.
Are you just going to stand there all day?
Your cat is fat.
The weather remained rainy.
May I take a picture of you?
This is good meat.
He has a big mouth.
You don't have to answer this question.
I don't feel like playing cards.
How long does it take from here to your house on foot?
He turned pale the instant he saw her.
What do you want to do now?
My feet hurt.
Can you call him?
You're a terrible person.
Stay away from my daughter!
She reminded him to go to the bank.
Do you really want to stay young forever?
The game is over.
I appreciate your time.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Did he go there?
I don't expect you to start now.
They didn't know what to do with him.
Do you really want it?
I'm not sure if I'm stupid or not.
I want to hold your hand.
That sounds right.
Everyone who worked on that project became a millionaire.
I thought you had somewhere else to be.
We all learn by experience.
He is bound to win the match.
These two brothers resemble each other.
We're in pain.
Be nice to her.
I'll guide you.
Report to the emergency room.
Did you like it?
She's neither rich nor famous.
I have your schedule here.
He was very excited.
What time do you usually get up?
Daddy, let's make faces at each other and see who can keep from laughing the longest.
I finished the work yesterday.
Forget your sorrows.
Are you a typist?
Can they see us?
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
We have two sons.
Please excuse my bad handwriting.
Tom wiped his feet on the doormat.
He is Italian by birth.
I hate being alone at Christmas.
Some of them were wounded.
We must pay a toll to drive on this road.
It doesn't look like anybody's home.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
That's not my decision.
I'd love to talk to you.
He is a novelist and artist.
How many bags did you have?
I am taking a holiday at the beach.
Don't let them see you're afraid.
Tom and Mary left the party together.
Tom recently dyed his hair red.
His clothes always smell bad.
You're either with me or you're against me.
He was knee-deep in snow.
We can't just drive around all night.
What do these markings mean?
Did you like it?
Do I look like a plumber?
Whatever happens, you must keep calm.
I'm not offended.
Most boys like computer games.
This is very ingenious.
We discussed the subject at length.
The way she talks gets on my nerves.
My sister is bugging me.
Everything happened all at once.
What color is this?
I did it for him.
Is college worth it?
She studied English in the morning.
How good are you?
It was a waste of time.
Did you get everything ready for tomorrow?
Will it rain tomorrow?
She forced him to eat spinach.
Are you making friends here?
I thought you were older than me.
I am going to get dressed.
Will you look after my baggage?
I let the dog out.
I really like being with you.
Have you ever been on TV?
Tom said that he didn't want to be disturbed.
Tom did everything he could for his children.
You can't keep this a secret.
Tom was all worn out.
They're all waiting.
I went to see a movie with Tom after school.
Tom came here to help me.
I was afraid I'd be late.
How long have you been waiting for me?
He banged his head.
The upstairs window opened.
You should always ask for permission first.
You're not allowed to eat those.
I had to give it a try.
My brother just received tenure at the university where he teaches.
The teacher was disappointed at my answer.
Is this wine?
This shirt needs to be washed.
Who do you think that man is?
The competition has become fierce.
His house is not far from here.
What did you do with that?
Heat turns ice into water.
I know your name.
He admitted his mistakes.
I like English, but I cannot speak well.
I'm nearsighted.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
I really miss my girlfriend.
It's fun to learn slang words in foreign languages.
Tom believes that Mary was murdered.
I think that's a good idea.
Have you ever been kissed before?
Where should I sit?
You're alone, aren't you?
Tom said he'd rather not go to Mary's party.
Did I wake you?
I felt guilty.
I'll save you.
People laughed at him.
What will we eat?
Do you feel birthdays are important?
Not everything's about money.
For me, it's important.
My son likes to play with cars.
The stock market is very active.
Tom's friends tried to cheer him up.
That game was awesome.
Open your hand.
You said you wanted the truth.
I've got to get back home by midnight.
We must sit down.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
I don't know what more I can say.
I think many people do that.
The prime minister fell into the Danube and drowned.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Nail the windows shut.
This lake is deep.
What time did you arrive there?
The failure depressed him.
What's in the file?
When it rains, she takes the bus.
He is soon to be a father.
Everybody knows that.
Many students go to Europe for the purpose of studying music.
For what purpose?
I have to talk to you alone.
The police arrested the suspect yesterday.
I love you more and more every day.
He is good at taking photos.
Mary is my half-sister.
I think you need to see him.
Are you married or are you single?
I wanted sympathy.
She complained of the room being too hot.
This is my horse.
Tom should let Mary know that he likes her.
Are you ashamed of me?
Did you catch the first train?
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it.
He teaches English to his friends.
We got stuck in traffic.
I saw you snickering.
A sleeping child is like an angel.
She wouldn't let up until I agreed to go to the movies with her.
I caught up with them soon.
They've written a bill for health care.
That a boy!
I have to tell her that the phone rang while she was gone.
That's not what I'm trying to say.
It wasn't a dream.
A few days ago, you didn't even want to talk to me.
I thought you could use a break.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
We're going to work tonight.
I would like to see it.
The book is on the table.
Congress passed the bill.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
He's worried about the result.
May I be of service?
What a nightmare!
Where exactly are you?
Are you lying to me?
I love your garden.
For what purpose did he come here?
Go back to your seat.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
I remember them.
The door would not open.
What's your favorite movie?
Hold on a minute.
We heard something moving in the next room.
You're very helpful.
Mind your own business.
They're part-time employees.
I'd appreciate it if you could do that.
He has a friendly nature.
Do you mind if we sit down?
Did anyone see you come in here?
She kept on working.
Why did you listen to him?
I want to take you to dinner.
Never say never.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
Spring will be late.
I was at home.
You have a bright future.
Do you think you can help Tom?
It kept raining for three days.
They've had plenty of time.
I'm thinking about you.
I'm visiting my grandmother in the hospital.
Look, I owe you an apology.
I thought I knew you.
I look forward to meeting you again soon.
I hope you will call again.
Can you tell me where it is?
Are you students?
I like your style.
We did not evolve from monkeys. We share a common ancestor.
Have you asked if they want one?
Why didn't you follow my advice?
Cherry blossoms last only for a few days, a week at the most.
I'm going to need some more time.
Could you please give me some more examples of that?
In general, little girls are fond of dolls.
It's crowded again today.
Why would I be nervous?
Don't you know who I am?
Where are you from?
Did you enjoy reading that book?
Don't run here.
A man came to see me yesterday.
Let's go!
Why don't you answer?
Don't you hang up on me.
I am learning two foreign languages.
Keep up the good work.
How many people were aboard that ship?
I was a little afraid.
Stop screaming like a girl.
We talk frequently.
You can go back to bed.
I hope you've got some proof to back up your allegations.
It's almost half past eleven.
Enjoy it while you can.
I'd like to thank you all for coming.
I may not graduate.
I have won.
Let's not worry about it.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
They all know.
Few people live to be ninety years old.
That's what I thought.
It rained all day yesterday.
I'd like to sail around the world.
How dare you speak to me like that!
The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
I wish I could be more spontaneous.
I'm pleased with their performance.
I didn't think it would be that much.
I rented an apartment when I lived in Boston.
I'm beginning to feel a little sleepy.
Are you seriously thinking about driving all night?
They're up to no good.
He ate rice twice a day for many years.
We met earlier.
I'm going to rewrite this report.
We should work faster.
Are you sure he can do this?
This would be catastrophic.
I spent hours reading books.
How would they know what to do?
You need to work fast.
I don't want to resign my job at present.
What's your plan?
My sister is always weighing herself.
You're the one who trained me.
Food is necessary for life.
You have to read between the lines to know the true intention of the author.
I saw a shape in the dark.
Look at this picture.
There is no need for him to work.
Why are you waiting?
I'd like to reserve a single room.
I've been looking all over for you.
Hang on tight.
We're all retired.
Show me how to do that.
We're going to paint the wall.
Do you like this color?
I've got a lot of good ideas.
The idea is typical of him.
You're not fat.
She speaks too much.
The houses are burning.
My son loves rockets.
Don't take it seriously. It's a joke.
Send him in.
You said it was important.
This is the house where I was born.
Some diseases are caused by a defective gene.
They're headed this way.
Are you going, too?
We saw you.
We have considered your proposal, and we have decided that we are not able to reduce the price.
I didn't want to spend any more time in jail.
She shook her head.
She put on an air of innocence.
I'll leave it up to your imagination.
She wrapped the present in paper.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
How much do you have invested?
I have no statistics.
How's this possible?
I can't afford to waste a single yen.
The novel takes place in Victorian England.
I'm short of cash at the moment.
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
I can prove it to you.
Tom was very patient.
The high-profile kidnapping has captivated the nation.
She pulled him out of the mud.
I thought you might like some company.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
I'm proud of my son.
Tell me about your plan.
There is a mistake in this sentence.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
He showed signs of great emotion.
He won't be home at lunch time.
Something is slowing down my computer.
You don't look very good.
He leaned towards me.
Do you still want to be an officer?
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
I was trying to be supportive.
Everybody knows that he is honest.
Wait a minute.
I'd like to ask you one question.
I'd like to have ketchup on the side.
How do you define success?
I already bought my ticket to Boston.
I've seen a couple of Kurosawa's films.
I love how you think of other people's needs before your own.
I like your dress.
He has been sick since last Sunday.
I'm tired of watching TV.
What are you doing buying a house?
I went to the bank to take out money.
How could you not say something?
I think you should do it.
Tom left the lights on all night.
What choices do we have?
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
Your kiss is sweeter than honey.
Curiosity killed the cat.
That won't be a problem.
They smell bad.
I think it's very deceptive.
How could I lie to you?
She repeated her name slowly.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
I'm getting too old for this job.
Don't your neighbors ever complain?
He is more lucky than clever.
She got into hot water when her boyfriend called her at work.
I forgot all about that.
I want to stay alive.
I told them they shouldn't move.
That is how he always treats me.
He silently went out of the room.
Tom doesn't want to talk to you now.
Are you the group leader?
I didn't go to school yesterday.
Call a plumber.
I'll explain it all later.
All of us stared at her.
I don't like chocolate.
I'm not carrying any identification.
Do you really want to win?
What kind of question is that? Do you really expect me to answer that?
Somebody made a mistake.
Don't look at me!
They won't find it.
Nobody does it better.
Would you be friends with me?
What's your major?
She had to choose her words carefully.
I must work hard to make up for lost time.
He's henpecked.
He ran up the stairs.
You're too loud.
I'm too sleepy to do my homework.
The man standing over there is the owner of the store.
We're ruined.
My book has to be somewhere in the room.
He can't come with us.
I'm not sleeping well.
You're testing my patience.
I like to be spontaneous.
We know it works.
What's there to say?
I'd like to know the exact time.
He lives by begging.
I wish you were close to me.
I still need to buy some bread.
This winter will probably be very cold.
Is there something in there?
May I borrow your eraser?
Tom is complaining to the manager.
We bought the car for $12,000.
I spoke to the boy who seemed to be the oldest.
The meeting was almost over.
This one's all yours.
What did I forget to say?
That's not where I'm going.
I want you to be my friend again.
I usually don't work here.
I'll get lost.
Tom was apparently very convincing.
There's a river near my house.
He caught a big fish.
How can you be sure of that?
They stayed at a luxury hotel.
I think Tom will tell you.
You didn't try hard enough.
Are you still up?
There was a lot of snow last winter.
I'm shocked.
That might help.
You can do it.
I can easily give up chocolate to lose weight.
Where is the pain?
Keep the child away from the pond.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
The war ended in 1954.
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
Luck turned in my favor.
He was absent because of the storm.
No one wants to speak.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
I had a light lunch.
They dug through the mountain and built a tunnel.
I'm not making it up.
What do you call that contraption?
A new room was assigned to me.
I'm not telling you again.
You're always complaining about something.
Don't go in my room.
We believe it's possible.
Here is some water.
This armchair is comfortable.
That's cool.
Please read the instructions.
How many times a year do you go skiing?
When is a good time for you?
I've never even had a girlfriend.
Who'd want to hire Tom?
We're not cops.
We saw you.
I dropped my earring.
What is happening?
Either way's fine with me.
My robot's name is Multi.
Please show me another one.
He threatened me, but I wasn't scared.
I must be doing something wrong.
Without you, I would've died.
They might be taller than you.
It is going to rain soon.
I felt sorry for you.
How do you know?
I did my job.
You can't do two things at once.
I'll handle it.
I'm waiting for your assistance.
What are you cooking?
Do you love my brother more than me?
You're kind of cute when you're mad.
They left early.
Where will you go?
How did you get here?
You should check your blood pressure.
I did what I could.
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
She will surely be enjoying a hot bath at this hour.
When can you start?
You don't have to use a dictionary when you read this book.
This is a kind of bread.
I think I'm drunk.
I have to go.
Many young people go abroad during summer vacation.
I don't remember you at all.
I'm not an expert, so my answer to your question is just an educated guess.
Could you please tell me again where you put the key?
You need another ten dollars to buy that camera.
I think it's cruel to keep a cat indoors.
Tom didn't know how to say "thank you" in French.
I'll treat you to dinner.
It would be nice to get married.
Do you mind if I go?
Smoking affects your health.
How was your night?
I'll make you proud of me.
To the best of my knowledge, the cathedral dates back to the Middle Ages.
I have heard the story.
This room is very warm.
Who did you talk to?
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
The young girl sighed.
Please write it down.
Most writers are sensitive to criticism.
You've been warned.
I would like to meet you.
Why should you be surprised?
She lost her son in a car accident.
Could you please talk a bit louder? I can't hear very well.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
We all had the same idea.
I've got to get going.
It is not because I hate him, but because I love him.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
This is really humiliating.
Start running.
A haiku is one type of poem.
The next two years were busy ones for Jackson.
That's what you should say.
Are you a singer?
She left her son alone in the car.
Do your homework by yourself.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Tom is drunk as a skunk.
I found the photo you were looking for.
I look on you as my best friend.
We must always be ready.
Tom eats mostly fruits and vegetables, and only eats meat about once a week.
How was the reunion?
I want you to know how sorry I am.
Do you like French wines?
It really breaks my heart.
We go to school to learn.
Recently, there have been signs that the economy is picking up steam.
You've been following me, haven't you?
He took charge of the family business after his father died.
I want them to be your friends.
She unbuttoned her shirt.
It feels weird, doesn't it?
Tom knows who I am.
He was nearly hit by the car while crossing the street.
She has fallen in love with me.
I was distracted.
You're very helpful.
I need a volunteer.
Why don't men hibernate?
She hated him so much that our family could never go and visit him.
He is by no means bright.
How far is it from here to your school?
What do you intend to do with the money?
I've come to accept this.
Did you receive the letter?
Do you plan to go overseas?
How much did the tickets cost you?
This book is worth reading twice.
You need to be careful.
He asked for a beer.
I know you've been trying to help.
Night watchmen drink a lot of coffee.
Are you speaking to me?
What he says is absolutely correct.
You should have seen the movie.
I noticed that he had stopped.
I thought I knew what to do.
I'm offended.
I don't want you hanging out with Tom.
Tom never apologized.
That's my final answer.
The mountain is covered with snow.
All of us speak French.
He studied military history.
Tom gave Mary a box of chocolates.
Water becomes solid when it freezes.
Why are we helping Tom?
I love the view from my balcony.
How come you're always so energetic?
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
I cannot speak German.
Are you up?
I don't think he's playing with a full deck.
In addition to a thick fog, there was a heavy swell.
He shut the door behind him.
I didn't understand that.
Don't talk about my family.
I went for help.
That makes no sense whatsoever.
My dream went up in smoke.
These shoes are too small for me to put on.
Tom doesn't trust us.
Everyone loves him.
You're lying, aren't you?
She met him only recently.
You're not bruised.
It was obvious to everyone that the marriage would sooner or later end in divorce.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
Could I borrow your eyeliner?
May I have a straw, please?
He had to clean his room.
I think the mistake is mine.
Where should we hide?
There are certainly some points worth considering.
That's clever.
I just don't want to be reminded of it.
Please send it to me by fax.
Something's missing.
They didn't want me to examine it.
How do you know that?
Does he have any children?
My sister asked me to teach her how to ski.
Tell us a little about yourself.
Does truth matter?
She asked him to help her father clean the garage, but he said that he was too busy to help.
I know you're busy, too.
You're very stylish.
He failed the entrance exam.
I've started bleeding.
Have you been abroad?
We don't want anything like that to ever happen again.
I cut the article out of the magazine.
She likes word games.
I hid under the table.
I'll soon register for a course in German.
I have brown hair.
All I want is your love.
We're all here.
I started that.
What is aspirin made of?
He extinguished the fire.
That shop has many customers.
Who cares about facts?
I went to bed early.
I thought you had somewhere else to be.
Wood burns easily.
You are a good student.
Take all the time you need.
Do you play in a band?
I like to grow flowers.
The big, yellow bus came hurtling down the street.
I just started to learn Esperanto.
She is a famous singer.
That is the book I want to read.
Stop worrying about it.
Could you help me wash the dishes?
We're so glad to have you here.
I didn't say you were crazy.
It's nice to be appreciated.
You can't blame him for the accident.
I'd like to change clothes.
Did you see the way Tom was looking at you?
I am not always at home on Sundays.
This one is prettier.
Where are our friends?
The doctor says she suffers from rheumatism.
The plane was late because of bad weather.
You're a very lucky man.
I thought you were older than me.
We are having breakfast.
You can't say no.
Keep reading.
I like to sing songs.
I'm confident that you'll succeed.
I want you to know what really happened.
"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
He was unable to move.
I wish that I could give you the money you need.
I hope that's good enough.
I thought you'd be much fatter.
I found it necessary to ask for help.
Which of you came here first?
You have no proof.
Do you like Moscow?
They're all dead.
We're confident we'll be able to handle this.
She died on a cold night in December.
You gotta get more organized.
I don't think I can help you.
It wasn't mine.
Let's just try it.
How did you burn your hand?
Do you remember anything from back then?
I have the same number of books as he has.
I'm afraid my depth perception is very poor.
I even work on Sundays.
I borrowed the screwdriver from a friend of mine.
Who did you think I was?
This doesn't sound right.
I'm buying a puppy.
The water is rising.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
He must have entered this room.
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
Tom knew what Mary wanted to eat.
I don't want to open the window.
Have you told any of this to the police?
I knew before you knew.
This is ridiculous!
Don't sound so surprised. You know I can do whatever I want to do.
If you get enough rest every night, you'll feel much better.
We weren't talking about you.
I just listened and kept quiet.
How may I help you?
Stop hitting me!
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
I'm a big fan of golf.
Let's get the party rolling.
Remember what happened last time.
It was an uphill struggle.
It wasn't very fun.
Tom talked with Mary yesterday.
Thank you for the information.
It's not done yet.
He is known as a great painter.
I'll get you out of this horrible situation.
Take it, please.
The damage has been done.
You stay here.
What else does Tom need?
I like your shoes.
He was learning a poem.
I think we can come up with better plan than this.
Tom's book was translated into French.
You'll never leave this town.
He must finish his homework today.
Look both ways before you cross the street.
You can read this book.
He gathered the courage to decline the offer.
It is cloudy now.
I bought two dozen pencils.
The ice has melted in the sun.
I heard the boys singing.
He must have seen it.
That doctrine will no doubt lead to serious consequences.
No one will talk.
Tom didn't believe a word of what Mary said.
Have a nice day!
I want to learn to play the guitar like you.
Strive to be happy.
He did all the legwork.
I suddenly became dizzy.
Do you still have feelings for her?
You could do it if you really wanted to.
Stop hitting your brother.
He just doesn't measure up.
I have just read this book.
He did a pretty good job.
Tom is much older than he looks.
How could I refuse?
He leveled his gun at me.
We've been working all night.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
She asked him some questions, but he refused to answer.
Do you have a pen?
She knitted her father a sweater.
I blame you for this, Tom.
There's nothing like a good hot bath.
Would you like another cup of tea?
I need a pencil.
I beg you.
I was alone.
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
Don't you do this to me.
It's shocking, isn't it?
He gave me all his money.
I should have done this years ago.
She will get well soon.
I've decided to leave on Monday.
That applies to him too.
That wasn't very nice.
You must be back before ten.
He's a notorious liar.
I think you deserve more than this.
It doesn't matter.
I've got news for you, Tom.
A dog followed me to my school.
Does your dog bite?
Let's discuss these problems one at a time.
I remember the first time we met.
The TV doesn't work.
How many galaxies are there in the universe?
I shouldn't have to do all this work myself.
Where are your car keys?
Did you get it?
What's your theory on what happened?
How good are you?
I want to be heard.
He fills the bill.
I saw you yesterday.
I usually got to bed about eleven.
Am I first?
I don't feel like doing it today.
Tom didn't answer his phone.
We took turns driving.
No one is going to hurt you.
The boy was sold into slavery.
He will not listen to me.
I have bruises all over my body.
I do not like any of these hats.
They all did it.
It happened that the day was my birthday.
Be careful. This knife is really sharp.
She was playing with her sister at that time.
I'd like to stand.
I had a good time yesterday.
What are some foods you usually eat with soy sauce?
For all his wealth, he is unhappy.
Turn around, please.
The bad smell sickened me.
How could you be so cruel?
We lost.
The teacher pokes his nose into everything.
Am I early?
Why don't you sit here?
Tom didn't see it.
Kids are smarter than you think.
She hung up in silence.
Life begins when you are forty.
I remember laughing.
They have everything they need.
Are you quite certain about it?
I noticed that I had slept past my station.
It's now my turn.
I'm not talking to you.
I got carded.
Raise your left hand.
Let's continue from where we left off.
He may be there.
How have you been recently?
That doesn't make sense to me.
Can you complete the job in two days?
How come I've never seen you here before?
You have such a wonderful eye for detail.
Help me pick out a tie to go with this suit.
I have absolute trust in you.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
Never mind!
Don't tell me you stole it.
You're unambitious.
I have no excuse.
Am I right?
Are there any cute boys in your class?
See you tomorrow.
She studies English every day.
I'm not satisfied.
Boys will be boys.
Tom jumped out of the window.
I'm afraid not.
I'm not ignoring you.
Tom is cruel.
I should get to Boston by lunchtime.
How's your old lady doing?
I'm not quitting now.
I can help you.
She wants a new hat.
She shouldn't go by herself.
The cat climbed up the tree.
Health is more important than wealth.
There's ample room in the attic.
Show me where it happened.
They all have come.
What do you do for a living?
I like that shirt.
Everything is extremely simple.
I had dinner ready for you.
He gave the same answer as before.
I can't imagine life on another planet.
I'll fix a drink.
They're the cream of the crop.
We're touched.
Tom spent time with Mary.
What's your real purpose?
He likes to play rough.
I know what this is about.
They live downstairs.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary's family.
If it had not been for your foolishness, we would never have been in that trouble.
She was sitting under a tree.
Are you looking for somebody?
As we ate our meal, we talked about what we had done that day.
I know someone who has never seen the ocean.
Can we help you?
He agreed to give us an interview.
Don't take our word for it.
This desk is good.
That's enough. I don't want any more.
She is wearing a nice watch.
The book is here.
The bucket was full of water.
I won't be going with you.
I don't think Tom will ever forgive me.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
My husband and daughter are fast asleep.
I've got to get home.
She gave me an album as a birthday present.
You should act more calmly.
I never saw you.
He surprised his opponent.
I had nothing to do with it.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
She helped her daughter get dressed.
Keep off the grass.
Tom kissed Mary and she slapped him.
I think Tom's idea is a good one.
I'm not finished.
I listen to jazz sometimes.
I'm trying to save Tom's life.
My father is in.
I can do this with you or without you.
I ate too much last night.
It seems that he knows about it.
You lied to me, didn't you?
Someone stole my belongings.
Some people are just weird.
I never want to see you get sick.
I miss you already.
I wanted to go swimming.
You're young.
Tom was complaining of back pain.
I am thinking of resigning at once.
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
We decided to lie hidden for a few days.
Her father is a policeman.
I had to find out for myself.
Do you study every day?
I was deceived by him.
Treat him well.
I rescheduled.
I got it.
We'll visit you tomorrow.
What's your favorite sport?
I considered that.
It depends on how much money you have.
Maybe it was obvious.
Do you have to go there every day?
I had nowhere else to go.
A computer is a complex machine.
I'd be devastated.
Give me back the book after you have read it.
I got off lightly.
Who is your lawyer?
How could you be so cruel?
Why did you come here today?
My plan was adopted by them.
She grabbed a shower.
You can't count on his help.
They got to be good friends.
She didn't know what to say to him.
I'm getting used to eating alone.
I just don't fit in anymore.
His behavior is very odd today.
You have to read between the lines to know the true intention of the author.
Let's ask him.
Some built houses partly underground.
I work from Monday through Saturday.
It's an interesting argument.
No way!
We must go.
I think you panicked.
Don't leave your stuff behind.
I will pick him up at the station.
I made a couple calls.
I'm terribly sorry.
Congratulations!
We're going shopping.
We can't give up.
It seems that something has happened.
It's an abuse of power.
She wasn't polite to him.
She sorted the washing before putting it in the washing machine.
She strongly resembles her grandmother.
It is true that he is young, but he is clever.
We're not related.
The duke holds a lot of land.
The committee meets twice a month.
I'm running out of ideas.
How come you know so much?
I don't know what it is.
I'll need your help.
I'm not used to talking to people I don't know.
I don't like going out by myself at night.
I like rice more than bread.
She got the money from him even though he said that he wouldn't give it to her.
You know her name, don't you?
He will come.
It's about time.
I hurried so I wouldn't miss the train.
Stop staring.
I suppose anything's possible.
What you are saying does not make sense.
I'm having a very difficult time today.
I feel depressed because there are a lot of things I have to do.
Do you know how to do this?
The supplies are beginning to give out.
Wait for us.
You should tell Tom what to do.
Tom cleaned his room this morning.
Let me put off my decision.
I really don't feel well.
Tom didn't want to kiss Mary.
Take out your notebooks.
Light the candle.
I don't have any money.
You seemed to like that.
He isn't actually the manager.
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
It'll be hard to convince Tom to help us.
Every man has his price.
Monopoly is a popular game for families to play.
You can't run from the past.
He does nothing but watch TV all day long.
That's why I love you.
He introduced his daughter to me.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
It'll soon be three o'clock.
It's not fair at all.
Tom insisted on going alone.
He wishes to erase bad memories.
I felt like I was intruding.
Is that a problem?
They are making a salad.
I'm not your daughter.
That's going to cost you a lot of money.
What does your father do?
I'll be very discreet.
Judging from the look of the sky, it will clear up in the afternoon.
It was a national scandal.
Do you like mine?
Are you referring to me?
Be very careful.
Did you enjoy the tour?
I like light colors.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
I gained two kilos this summer.
He wanted to meet me.
Tom is interested in mountaineering.
I hardly see you anymore.
We'll only wait three more hours.
How long does it take from here to the station?
Is there anything I should know about?
I enjoyed myself.
I was astonished.
I don't think Tom would lie.
He spends his evenings in front of his laptop.
I'm glad you brought that up.
Her voice sounds very beautiful.
I fell into the water.
That is the house where I was born.
Are you trying to kill me?
They can't fire you.
He forgave me breaking my promise.
I've been saying that all along.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
That's really scary.
I can't even cook an omelet.
I've seen this before.
You intimidate Tom.
She appears to have a lot of friends.
That message was sent by Tom.
Mozart's life was very short.
All my plants died.
That one's all yours.
What time do you usually get up?
Some people think that there are way too many lawyers in this country.
The employee was escorted off the premises.
You're trespassing here.
I promise you I'll explain everything later.
I'm not surprised.
He can't come with us.
I've been drinking too much coffee.
My driving instructor says I should be more patient.
He suggested that we go for a swim.
We forgot.
I'm kind of busy tonight.
How do you think I can convince her to spend more time with me?
The leaves fell from the trees.
He remained silent the whole time.
Last night was very hot and muggy, so I didn't sleep so well.
You have to hurry up.
I doubt if he'll come to school today.
You're one of them, aren't you?
Trust no one.
No one asked you.
Don't touch this!
I have doubts about the success of their plan.
Did you see what I did?
I'm being promoted.
They will agree on that.
Maybe that'll be enough.
I am a gentleman's daughter.
Why would anybody come here?
What time is the concert?
Tom won't let you down.
Tom couldn't believe what had happened.
You won't believe who sat down next to me.
I will come earlier next time.
I will try again.
I know he likes jazz music.
The air feels somewhat cold this morning.
I know you want to help him.
Where's my box of chocolates?
I can't believe you're really here.
I think you want this more than you want to admit.
This is your house.
He gave me a stern look.
I'm introverted.
That gave me a rough idea.
I still don't understand how this happened.
"When does he study?" "He studies before dinner."
I'll just leave this here.
I love a happy ending.
Don't be so lazy.
What did you do to it?
I freaked out and started screaming.
You had better ask him which way to take.
Why do you have to be like that?
She ignored him all day.
I am convinced that he is innocent.
We can wait.
Don't leave it open.
She pressed her lips firmly together.
Did you go to any famous gardens?
I like your dog.
Italy isn't Greece.
Just leave me alone.
He had to call on all his experience to carry out the plan.
I added a room to my house.
The teacher lined the children up in order of height.
I noticed that.
Waiter, I'd like to order.
That wall is cold.
We were all shocked.
He studied the way birds fly.
The ground is covered with snow.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Sorry about earlier.
Is that a no?
Tom often thought about Mary.
Are you happy right now?
I think about you all day long.
We're certain.
Who else is out there?
I like the slow rhythm of that song.
They made fun of my clothes.
God knows we did everything we could.
Summer is the season I like best.
He passed the test as was expected.
Mr. Jackson is a very good teacher.
She sold all of her furniture, so she could afford to feed herself and her dog.
Is this really what you want to do?
I've got something to do.
He promised he would help us.
Hokkaido is to the north of Honshu.
If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay at home.
The fuel tank in the car is full.
The barometer is falling. It is going to rain.
I had to climb over the wall.
All I ask is that you show up on time.
Parents need a lot of patience.
It glows in the dark.
I know who asked you here.
The prince succeeded to the throne.
We saw Tom talking to Mary in the park this morning.
You have only to answer the first question.
I received your letter the day before yesterday.
We fixed the price at $15.
Don't move till I get back.
Are you a registered voter?
Do it right now.
He did the best he could.
He said it as a joke.
I couldn't let you take all the blame.
They all objected to his proposal.
I'm not going to tell you how to do that.
I feel young.
This ticket is valid for three days.
You can't just walk away from this mess.
Why did she do that?
Tom isn't joking.
Is it difficult work?
He has only a superficial knowledge of Japanese.
They're acting on their own.
We'll need to amend the contract so that we can pay you more.
We're doing what we want to do.
I'll be back tonight.
I know that you feel helpless.
Surely he'll phone me tonight.
His negotiators had disobeyed his orders.
They can't do that.
Recently, I moved to a new apartment.
No matter how much you try to convince people that chocolate is vanilla, it'll still be chocolate, even though you may manage to convince yourself and a few others that it's vanilla.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
Tom saw a mouse.
I suppose you're hungry.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
Don't tell anyone this.
These pants fit me well.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
He must be Tom's brother.
She came to see us yesterday.
I think you'd better go.
I am brushing my teeth.
I was as surprised as you.
Show me your passport, please.
She gained weight.
You're so predictable.
There was no warning.
What do they want to talk about?
She is firmly determined to own a store of her own.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
We are his children.
Are you sure of it?
Well? Will you come?
Are you working?
The conference will end tomorrow.
Get to the point.
What have I done with my keys?
She always keeps her hair clean.
I have three tickets for it.
It was not an easy decision.
We have a dog, a cat and three canaries.
He is cranky.
Tom was sure of it.
He felt a sharp pain in his chest.
The cause of the accident is still obscure.
They say they cannot compete with low-priced foreign products.
This is totally insane.
You're driving me nuts.
I don't feel sorry for you.
No one saw that.
That made me very sad.
I'm glad you're here.
You're really annoying.
Let me see it.
I met him at the station.
You're in danger.
A leaf is falling.
Where should we go?
I'm sorry that you couldn't come with us.
You must go to bed now.
Don't be a copycat.
Let's play hide and seek.
I hope we don't have to sell our house.
You're not trying to trick me, are you?
Huge numbers of soldiers and civilians were killed.
He looked very happy.
I thought the food was too greasy.
It is time you went to bed. Turn off the radio.
I asked the boy to throw the ball back.
He seems interested in her.
Stop being so nice.
What did you do on the weekend?
It was foolish of him to do such a thing.
It's boring to stay at home.
Your dream of becoming a baseball player will come true if you try hard.
That was without doubt a magical moment.
She is hard up for money.
I love three-day weekends.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
I hit him on the chin.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
Tom's coming.
The light was on.
Tom asked Mary whether she planned to swim or not.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
You're grounded.
Are you seriously thinking about getting involved?
Sometimes I have to read boring novels.
Are you sure you don't want to live at home with your parents?
Does that mean you bought it?
Tom used to come here all the time.
Many native speakers of Japanese have trouble hearing the difference between B and V.
You guys can do it if you try.
I can't understand his feelings.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
His girlfriend did it for him.
I am determined to be a scientist.
She looked all around.
The weather is nice tonight.
You said that you hated Tom.
Be sensible.
Which is cheaper?
You're creative.
I can't decide what to eat for lunch.
Tom began to worry about Mary.
I should tell you something.
"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
I like this room.
I don't have anything to say to you.
I want to file a complaint.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
I just want to be alone.
Do you speak English?
Happy New Year!
I've never been to Europe.
Today is a beautiful day.
It doesn't really matter much anymore.
I was always good at math.
The light in Tom's room is on.
I don't work tomorrow.
You aren't as short as I am.
Above all, don't forget to write me.
Can you help me paint my house?
What part of Australia are you from?
He likes swimming in the summer.
I do want to be your friend.
You need a joystick.
Don't take any chances.
You haven't seen Tom this morning, have you?
I want you to be prepared.
I'll walk.
Your shoes don't go with that outfit.
I really need to go.
Put your valuables in the safe.
Detroit is famous for its car industry.
I saw a house in the distance.
This custom began in the Edo Period.
I remember seeing you last year.
Wow! What a big box!
She is not only beautiful but also intelligent.
A ball hit her right leg.
You don't need to wait.
I'd like to study French next year.
You're good.
Leave out this word.
What do you like about him?
It's the biggest house in the neighborhood.
I thought I got it all.
What's everyone staring at?
I was going to go.
What are you looking for?
Please tell me what happened.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
I feel sorry for you.
Why don't you hang around a while after everyone else leaves so we can talk?
Look, I'm being serious.
I keep a daily record of the temperature.
It's already eleven o'clock. I must be leaving now.
I don't do all that much.
You need to be more patient.
Look both ways before you cross the street.
Doctors save lives.
Today is very cold.
Got it?
My brother doesn't swim.
Listen to what I am saying.
I figured I might find you here.
At last he attained his goal.
I agree.
Would you like to go on a trip together?
I hope everything is okay.
I have very good eyesight.
Once she starts talking, she is hard to stop.
I asked my teacher what to do next.
Do you think it's going to snow?
What a good shot!
He used to be a quiet man.
If you want one, you'll have to find your own.
There is a cafeteria in the university.
Choose the color you like the best.
My uncle lives in an apartment.
What time do you start check-in?
When did you start wearing contacts?
You can go if you want to.
Our debt is more than we can pay.
Did you leave at the same time as my younger sister?
His mother used to be a singer.
Tom knows he has no chance of winning.
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
Europe has a smaller population than Asia.
I prefer it this way.
He gave his seat to the old man.
We can do it right now.
Please smile.
Don't be fresh to me.
He cried as if he were a boy of six.
We ran a hundred-meter dash.
It's better than doing nothing.
We need to invest in clean, renewable energy.
He did it in front of the staff.
I'm going to go to the doctor this afternoon.
She walked slowly away from me.
I'm not hitting on you.
I came upon an old friend of mine on the train.
I've got no time for that.
You had better not keep company with him.
He took the job reluctantly.
Tell the truth.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
It's an experiment.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
I lived abroad for ten years.
Take your time. We have all afternoon to shop.
Lay it on the table.
It'll rain for sure.
I didn't know you were expecting anyone.
I left my wife.
It didn't take you long to get here.
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
Do these paintings appeal to you?
This is depressing.
I know what they mean.
Everyone always speaks well of Tom.
He denied the rumor.
He died a few days later.
I won't give them to you.
Have you ever dyed your hair?
We need something a bit more subtle.
None of this is your fault.
Can I come some other time?
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
I bear no grudge against you.
You want to go out for a drink?
The customer is not always right.
The senator was censured by the congressional ethics committee.
Where in Turkey do you live?
To make a long story short, he married his first love.
Hold your horses, young man.
Is that what Tom meant?
Listen to what I have to say.
He studies contemporary literature.
Could you fill me in?
Anyone home?
The bill passed at the last moment.
I hurried in order to catch the first train.
She knows ten times as many English words as I do.
That's their strategy.
It wasn't me who started the fight.
He gets his hair cut once a month.
I should have done this weeks ago.
It's not supposed to happen.
He wants to go to America.
He never speaks unless spoken to.
Bottoms up!
I can't confirm that.
It is no use blaming him for the accident now.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
Why don't we go and see a movie?
The man was a total stranger.
I had hardly reached the school when the bell rang.
How did it go last night?
You will never defeat me!
Don't call anybody.
I have cancer.
At what hour was she born?
There's really nothing else to say.
Don't you know who I am?
You really didn't know, did you?
How will you pay your debts?
Tom isn't very imaginative.
That's peculiar.
Don't you want to go to the party?
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
I'm impressed you've done so well.
You're driving too fast.
I dislike being alone.
There's no way to get in touch with him.
I don't need crutches anymore.
It looks familiar.
We meet once a month.
It's popular with women.
It's a large one.
Does he have a girlfriend?
They're gone.
We will have to postpone the game.
I watch television after supper.
He's still alive.
The students like it.
Tom shook my hand.
I can't believe everything that just happened.
Please be serious.
I think my mom knows.
This clock seems to be broken.
The doctor took my pulse.
Do you expect me to believe you?
He likes that video game very much.
Tom often walks to school.
We are boiling water.
I think you're drunk.
Tom isn't a doctor.
There was no one there besides me.
I can see myself in the mirror.
Is there any reason not to go?
Mom, could you read me a bedtime story?
You're very talented.
The old man is always accompanied by his grandson.
Is the room big enough for you?
I don't have to wear glasses any more.
Did I wake you up?
I don't believe it happened that way.
I will meet you at the station at 10 a.m.
Anybody hurt?
They arranged a meeting.
Let's get a drink.
What was the time of death?
We can't leave our tents on the beach where they are now. If we do, they'll be under water during high tide.
He promised to marry her.
He was wrong.
I'll show you that I am right.
Whatever happens, he won't change his mind.
I never saw such a woman.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
This is the cheaper of the two.
She is used to sitting.
I'd like to learn to play the harp.
Are there any letters for me?
They glanced at each other.
He read the letter over and over.
It is almost three.
The company, wholly owned by NTT, is doing well.
Everyone else waited.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
We felt sympathy for her.
This desk is broken.
She practices the piano in the afternoon or in the evening.
He works every day but Sunday.
I really didn't do much.
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
I'm really proud of it.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
That's a copy.
You all did good work.
I don't ever want to see you again.
The ice is melting.
There's one thing I must tell you.
Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.
I don't know how to do that.
You hurt him.
Bring me my shoes.
How much do you charge to fix a flat tire?
Think about it.
Did you invite him?
What time is your plane scheduled to take off?
I usually prefer to pay with credit card and not with cash.
Would you like to see Tom?
You want answers to questions you shouldn't ask.
Well, what does that tell you?
I want you to take a good look around.
Tom has made a decision.
Every time they talk, they argue.
It's all perfect.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
Tom is a fluent speaker of Japanese.
They saw us yesterday.
Let me know what you're up to.
He came after you left.
Would you like to go for a walk?
I eat dinner after work.
It is not necessary for us to attend the meeting.
He's not the brightest guy in the world.
I should congratulate you.
I don't know what it is, but it's something very big.
Measles can be quite dangerous.
He tried to commit a suicide.
He made reference to the previous director.
Will you dance with me?
Tom always wants to sit in the front row.
We are all set.
They're hoping the wheat harvest will be good this year.
Tom can't control himself.
Tom cried all morning.
It's not as easy as you think.
See if the gas is turned off.
How did your speech go?
That never should've happened.
I know that boy who is running.
Americans admire Lincoln for his honesty.
Your French is good.
My father doesn't just smoke, he drinks too.
I knocked, but no one opened the door.
Tom knew where to go.
You should put your ideas in writing.
Who took care of you?
His health ebbed slowly away.
All my friends say that.
Go home quickly.
I want to make it up to you.
I'm going.
Get a job so you can support your wife and kids.
I don't mind your staying here.
We climbed higher so that we might get a better view.
What language is spoken in Egypt?
I want you to know how sorry I am.
Everything was very good.
Are there any letters for me in today's mail?
Give me some time to think.
He described exactly what happened.
There was another one.
Your mother is going to kill me.
I've decided never to vote again.
Tom lived in that small house for a little over ten years.
I can't wait to get there.
The cat was not buried alive. He survived.
She advised him to go there.
I never should've let Tom eat so much candy.
Aren't you going to take your coat off?
Allow me to introduce myself.
That's an excellent suggestion.
Make up your own mind.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
I'm counting on it.
It's illegal to buy cocaine.
Could you drop me off at the library?
Tom must be wrong.
He had a strong alibi.
Tom hoped to succeed.
I hate the way I look.
Air is a mixture of several gases.
They are very compatible.
She was unconscious for three days.
I'm used to Tom now.
You don't need to worry about that kind of thing anymore.
How do you stand this heat?
That actually sounds like a lot of fun.
Do I need to say more?
I saved you.
Where is Paris?
It's up to you to keep things running smoothly.
I figured it out by myself.
We haven't seen you in a while.
Given her interest in children, I am sure teaching is the right career for her.
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
He did a good job.
We need to conserve ammunition.
You're very funny.
Do you want help with that?
Are you recording this?
I can now die a happy man.
We thought it was hilarious.
Does your mom know?
She is a reliable person.
You look terrific.
Hurry up, girls.
Why don't you talk to him?
Why won't you look at me?
If I had known, I would not have come.
Fill the bottle with water.
Twelve years old is old for a dog.
He was very tall, so I recognized him at once.
I agree with that opinion.
Do you know whose handwriting this is?
Tom isn't doing anything.
Bread is made from wheat.
I didn't go to school last month.
Only four horses competed in the race.
You're early.
I would like to do more.
You may catch sight of our house from the train.
We were all shaking from the bitter cold.
Eat your vegetables.
He promised to marry her.
I lack imagination.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
The bar was so crowded you could hardly move.
The place is almost deserted.
They stood on the top of the hill.
We were unable to follow his logic.
She allowed him to go alone.
I don't know anything about cricket.
Is it any warmer inside?
I was overwhelmed.
Tom snores.
She couldn't afford it.
I liked your friends.
I'll fix it now.
I'm pleased with their performance.
You have a great imagination.
She forgot that she had promised to call him last night.
He needs a more productive outlet for his anger.
What do you have against those people?
I'm glad that you understand.
I'm not happy with my job.
How long will that be?
The park is located in the center of the city.
Do you like to study?
We had to postpone the gathering because of rain.
Did you meet her?
I had dinner with a friend last night.
We have people everywhere.
They didn't obey their parents.
I'll follow you anywhere.
I have to think about what needs to be done.
Coat the chicken breast with flour.
The news made them happy.
I can smell cookies.
I'm glad you liked my friends.
He fought until the end.
She obeys him no matter what he tells her to do.
Whatever you do, don't pull this rope.
Tom seems to have it in for me.
He is very talented.
She and I usually have the same opinion.
This is really delicious soup, isn't it?
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
What are you doing these days?
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
No one lives here.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I've warned you before about this.
She always stood by me.
The dog will not harm you.
I feel like going out.
I'm still waiting for my order.
I can't afford a pay cut.
Tom wants to be rich.
Have you finished reading the book?
Can you remember his name?
We're really scared.
He hid behind the tree.
I admit that I was careless.
How much more work do you have?
How did you all get here?
I'd like to hear more about that.
You seem busy.
The economy of Japan is still stable.
I felt dumb.
There is only one bath towel.
The door blew shut.
First we'll eat, and then we'll go.
Let's not wait any longer.
We like it.
You should eat more fruit.
Take good care of my daughter, Tom.
I'm volunteering.
She made up her mind to graduate from high school.
I can't do it alone.
Tom forgot to tell us not to drink the tap water.
What did you do then?
Despite all his setbacks, he remains an optimist.
You can't handle it.
Tom doesn't want you to get hurt.
She quoted a poem by Keats.
I got there ahead of time.
D.H. Lawrence is a novelist and poet.
The sun gives us light and heat.
I'm waiting for your help.
You need to be more careful from now on.
I read a book as I walked.
We talked about various topics.
I'm such a fool.
How did you spend your vacation?
Is there life on other worlds?
I'm proud of you guys.
All are present.
The truck made a sharp turn to the right.
He lives in this neighborhood.
Would you hand me that?
I didn't get much sleep last night.
So what do we do now?
I am so sick.
The American ships were stopped and searched in British waters.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
The accident happened at that intersection.
My sister started crying.
She was quite eager in her studies.
Just act as if nothing has happened.
I want to see your supervisor.
I can't believe you're eating what the doctor told you not to eat.
It's settled then.
I realized what was happening.
Don't think about it. Do it.
I really want to thank you.
Will you go to the movies with me?
Please get this work finished by Monday.
I'm not narrow-minded.
The days are getting longer and longer.
You weren't married for long, were you?
Flashy people irritate him.
Fashions grow old and die.
I'll tell you what I know.
Would you say it once more?
Of all these cakes I like this one best.
The FBI secretly bugged the mobster's hangout.
This plan has no flaws.
I bet you're busy.
That time table gives the hours of arrival and departure.
Please show me that.
Where did you go to school?
Stop doing that.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
He's eager to speak to you.
I saw it from the window.
Do not cast pearls before swine.
In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have gone there with her.
The spell was broken and the pig turned into a man.
Those are nice.
Tom likes writing.
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
It was extremely funny.
You can bank on that.
There was lavender in bloom as far as the eye could see.
Although she lives nearby, I rarely see her.
The hunter caught the fox.
Don't you talk back to me.
I don't even know why we're going.
I have no idea how long it will take.
Please explain the rule to me.
You overestimate him.
Let me finish, OK?
Tom knows the police suspect him.
I haven't finished my breakfast yet.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
She is always trying to please him.
How strange life is!
Our bike tour of the French Alps lasted two weeks.
She left the room without saying a word.
What kind of work will you do?
Say hello to your father for me.
You're spending too much time on the computer.
Ask him his name.
She filled her bag with apples.
How did you spend your free time?
You are not Japanese.
Have you ever had a serious illness?
They were beginning to lose faith in their commander.
You're the oldest.
Come to think of it, I really need a cellphone.
How many times do I have to say it?
She advised him of the date for the next meeting.
You probably just want to be alone.
I don't particularly care what you think.
Tom clearly lied.
They discussed the problem.
May I go?
They apologized for the inconvenience.
I'm not taking sides.
He is a man you can rely upon.
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
She seems to have something to do with the affair.
What changes the world is communication, not information.
I don't know where she lives.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
There are no clean plates.
I don't like your friends.
That's not how it happened.
Wealthy older men often marry younger trophy wives.
I can't go any further.
How about this one?
He is to come here at six o'clock.
I think we can relax now.
You're never too old to learn.
I persuaded him that he was wrong.
That's what I'm trying to do.
We arrived at the office on time.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
We were rowing against the current.
Cars arrived there one after another.
I must object.
Yours is over there.
Stop arguing.
Are there kids?
Don't talk to me about work.
You've been cleared of all charges.
Tom doesn't know where to look.
Stop being so naive.
Educational reforms still have a long way to go.
If possible, I'd like to see him.
I had this suit custom made for me.
I have no idea what'll happen.
May I ask what you're working on?
My parents are no longer living.
How did they find out?
These boxes are heavy.
Mary is Tom's mother.
I wonder where she has gone.
I hope you won't leave me here.
I think we're too late.
Are you wearing that dress for the first time?
She looked at me and smiled.
He was innocent of the crime.
I dream of seeing him there.
I'll order that later.
Tom wanted to be part of that.
I don't shave my legs.
The most important thing in the Olympics is not to win but to participate.
Everybody groans.
Tom borrowed a car from a friend.
I'm very strict.
I should be happy.
We do this all the time.
I baked cookies.
What position do you hold?
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
I go there every year.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
He promised me that he wouldn't tell anybody.
He arrived in time.
Try it once again.
You are very smart.
That's how he invented the machine.
That house is the only one that survived the fire.
You'll find something that interests you.
Would you be willing to help?
I didn't see any tigers.
I'll keep my fingers crossed that everything will go well for you today.
It is a song.
They were scolded by the teacher.
He bought himself a dog.
Open up.
We don't want any freeloaders around here.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
I hate fish.
Hypnotism works.
I gave you fair warning.
Tom is tolerant.
Give it back to her.
What the devil are you doing?
When can I visit you?
Why are you so hard-headed?
Are you proud of yourself?
Tom's home.
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle.
I hate the sound of my voice.
Tom refused to take part in the game.
What are you looking for?
Can you give me a geological explanation of lava?
I'm going to be your teacher.
How does that make you feel?
I drank a glass of milk this morning.
She refused to accept the money.
Only a few TV programs are worth watching.
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow.
She studies as hard as ever.
They greeted each other warmly.
Come along with us if you like.
Life in prison is worse than the life of an animal.
Tom is his brother.
I'm ugly.
I didn't meet any of my friends.
I'll try to fix it later.
How was the weather yesterday?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
He is most likely to succeed.
She had to accept her fate.
When I painted this picture, I was 23 years old.
He contracted malaria while living in the jungle.
They fought until the end.
I need a few minutes alone.
I think Tom is dangerous.
It's really hot today.
Does anyone need a lift home?
I'm not sure I'd want to live here.
You don't need to hurry. Take your time.
This is the place I told Tom about.
You must pay in advance.
You can have breakfast between 7 and 9.
That wasn't so hard to admit, was it?
He walked in front of me.
He burst into laughter.
What about us?
Write at least 250 words.
I've no idea what's happening.
She recognized him immediately.
What if you were able to buy the house you've always dreamed of?
I've lived here for three years.
I won't tell if you won't.
Don't open the door for anyone.
They are about the same age.
Her cardigan was unbuttoned.

Don't let Tom frighten you.
I just don't buy it.
My mother cut my hair too short.
Something did happen, didn't it?
I saw the figure of a man.
Your answer is wrong.
She was aware of his eyes.
Did you already do your homework?
The building collapsed in the earthquake.
Could I talk to the two of you alone?
I'd like to see that.
The way you sit tells a great deal about your nature.
What are you reading?
I want to go to America someday.
Tom was delirious.
Are these your things?
You had a long day.
He began to cry.
No criminal charges will be filed against you.
Tom has chosen you.
I'm used to it.
I had my shoes cleaned.
Let's see what you have there.
I don't know how I've offended you.
This house is abandoned.
His book inspired me.
We're just tired.
I wish we could live here.
He got more than he bargained for.
Tom doesn't often do his homework before dinner.
I don't earn enough money to buy clothes regularly.
The ground was very rocky.
Stop correcting me.
What do you learn English for?
He's afraid that he might be late.
That's a blatant lie.
That's ugly.
Don't waste your breath.
The moon is out.
It's still not ready.
We're here.
Your problem is similar to mine.
I have so many things I want you to know.
Get out of the water.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
Look what I made for Tom.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You are completely wrong.
I knew what Tom wanted.
Don't change the subject.
When my dad finds out, he won't be happy.
I'm gullible.
My grandfather was an archaeologist.
You don't have to apologize.
Tom wasn't aware of the gravity of the situation.
Go early in order to get a good seat.
She is used to staying up all night.
The earthquake was the biggest one that we had ever experienced.
Tom said he wanted to do more.
Do as you're told.
Steel traps are illegal.
He would give an arm and a leg for that.
I have faith in the future.
I waited half an hour for my friend, but he didn't turn up.
He is thick as a brick.
My sister is shorter than you.
You lied to me.
This water tastes good.
Are you alone?
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
She laid the child down gently.
Playing tennis is fun.
We met them at the youth hostel.
Is that seriously what you think?
Let's go to the picnic.
I shouldn't drink.
Tom does volunteer work.
You are free to go home.
I get very angry when you don't answer my questions.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
Can you guess the price?
He lives far away from my house.
You don't have to get up so early.
It's acceptable.
Can we drop this?
Why should you suspect me?
Try to be more punctual from now on.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
I let you down.
I have never been to Nikko.
Boston is a big city.
I didn't recognize it at first.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
You were told to stay on the ship.
I had my doubts.
She took her book.
I forgot the book.
He married my cousin.
Why don't we take the subway?
I did nothing wrong.
She might be seriously ill.
He is a really good worker.
You must keep your hands clean.
Get down from there.
Are you sure?
Shakespeare created many famous characters.
I suppose you love her.
He opened the door.
You can't have both books.
The dog looks sick.
Please help yourself to the salad.
A burnt child dreads fire.
Why didn't you phone before coming?
Tom may never be able to walk again.
We won't get to you until tomorrow.
The salesclerk will come to help you right away.
If only I knew!
She's pregnant.
He will be waiting for you about two o'clock.
She patted me on the shoulder.
I'd like to be alone.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
She cast an eye in his direction.
Tom doesn't speak French.
They're early.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
I haven't seen her since then.
I want to ask you some questions.
I gave you what you asked for.
I improvised.
Do you need a few minutes?
We must talk her out of this foolish plan.
My dad doesn't let me drive.
I saw him do it.
You're invited.
It's something my sister never wanted to do.
She said she was nurse, which was a lie.
Yesterday it rained the entire afternoon.
I don't understand English.
The book is easy.
How did you do that?
I want you back.
We are anxious about your health.
You have no proof.
What did I do to deserve this?
They live downstairs.
If I had known that you were here, I would have come at once.
He gave me a vague answer.
Tom waited for Mary to continue.
You're not dead yet.
I think it's time for me to give up on this relationship.
Are you awake?
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
Our dreams came true.
Why are you flinching?
Tell me where Tom is.
I've always played with my brother.
How does this camera work?
Who made the doll?
Don't leave!
I want you to know that Tom's important to me.
I'll go get the proper forms.
The rumor was without foundation.
Remember to mail the letter on your way to school.
You can't eat soup with a fork.
I refuse to give up on this.
We should hang out more.
I burned it.
I can't believe I listened to you.
You're incorrigible.
I would very much appreciate receiving a copy of the book.
You look like somebody I went to high school with.
I hate guys like that.
Don't let anyone enter or approach this room.
I want to see you two in my office. Now.
This is going to be easy.
I steered clear of sensitive topics.
I first met Tom when I was a little kid.
Do we know you?
Both of the windows were broken.
I'm very sorry to have troubled you.
Nobody answered the door.
Do you want me to lose my job?
AI means Artificial Intelligence.
She taught French in Italy before moving to Paris.
We may not have time.
She's always complaining about the food.
I've just talked to Tom about that matter.
Treat him well.
I don't feel very good.
They lost again.
Where are you going?
True happiness consists of desiring little.
Don't make me wait long.
She explained the matter to me.
I want to hold you.
They lost their dog.
Are they able to read these words?
You guys having fun?
That was easy.
I don't know if I can make it to your party or not.
It is impossible for me to do so.
You don't have to lie.
Everything is normal.
How long does it take to get to the stadium?
I can't believe you're here.
The truth finally came out at his trial.
Love me, love my dog.
As long as you're here, I'll stay.
I got my hands quite dirty.
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
She blushed.
He has decided not to go to the meeting.
Everyone looked unhappy.
Tom enjoys working here, I think.
You cannot do this.
Catch him.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
Tom is a high school student.
There are three hundred applicants for only one position.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
She advised him to catch the first train in the morning.
This medicine must not be placed within the reach of children.
They have access to the library.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
My sister takes piano lessons twice a week.
Is that why you want to hurt me?
What you are saying does not make sense.
They got the short end of the stick.
It may be unwise of you to advertise your presence.
I don't care what you say. It's not going to happen!
I have to tell her that the phone rang while she was gone.
Get your gear.
I love everything about Tom.
He said that if he knew her address, he would write to her.
Tom is very gullible.
You're not the first one to say that.
We can't help you.
Only members of the club are entitled to use this room.
You're not being rational.
I was the happiest man on earth.
I don't know what that is.
I looked him in the eyes.
You've got to try this.
I hate to see you so miserable.
He did what he promised to do.
Forget about that right now.
The old man tends to exaggerate.
Too many sweets make you fat.
This knife was very useful to me.
We have no choice but to do so.
Saddam rejected the demand.
Do you know the man who's staring at you?
I contacted them the other day, but I was not able to get an answer.
It would be a pity if you let this opportunity pass you by.
I lost my car keys.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened at school today.
I can't hear a word.
You have a lot of books.
Can I sit with you?
I don't think it would work as well as you might expect.
Without me, you won't be able to do it.
The warrior is conscious of both his strength and his weakness.
I can't be sure.
We'll get another one.
You are a good person.
He was a good king.
We must do something.
I asked my father to buy this toy.
Tell me what to think.
I might be a few minutes late.
Do you travel a lot?
It's rather ironic.
That's not what I asked you.
The Rhine is the boundary between France and Germany.
He has a lot of hobbies.
I'm capable of dealing with problems like this myself.

If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
The child is suffering from the heat.
That's just the way it is.
I made plans.
How many kinds are there?
Yeah, you could be right.
It was merely a matter of luck.
That was very interesting.
I've had enough.
You look incredible.
I thought you were my friend.
Keep on smiling.
Is there a hotel around here?
Didn't anyone question you?
I just want you to know that I won't be able to come to your picnic.
All men are brothers.
I spoke to him about it over the telephone.
Tell me what you want me to do.
They want us to come in right away.
I want that.
He had every reason for doing so.
My jeans shrank in the wash.
I don't need a doctor.
Has something else happened?
She is always finding fault with other people.
Don't be ashamed of yourself.
They don't have a car.
I got up at 4:00, ate some food, then went back to sleep.
Flowers are growing in the meadow.
Your friendship means a lot to me.
Let's pick up Tom.
She was asked to convince him to get his son to paint the house.
It was such a lovely day that everybody was feeling happy and cheerful.
I'm confident.
This is a map.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
Did you buy it on the black market?
Cuff him.
I can't put up with him any longer.
He said that you had better go.
I own a horse.
It's a new book.
Does this make me look fat?
He works too slowly to be helpful to us.
I just couldn't let that happen.
Will you go to the dance with me?
Bring along your friend.
I'm going to the supermarket to do some shopping.
I don't know how to make you happy.
I like to dream.
She talked a lot.
I'm sorry that I didn't reply sooner.
Look out the window.
Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn't do it.
Guys are supposed to respect girls.
Are you ready to go?
Don't touch my car.
Tom wants to be famous.
I hate hospital food.
I don't like to drive.
He left early.
Either you or she has to go there.
It looks like we didn't understand him.
There is little water left.
I want to go to college.
My children wear out their shoes quickly.
Kyoto is famous for its shrines and temples.
Can I give you a bit of advice?
The TV doesn't work.
He is going to stay with his uncle for the weekend.
I won't forget any of you.
How do you feel about Tom now?
A pet theory of mine is that things should be seen from a distance.
We can't just leave Tom here by himself.
There is a rumor that the radicals are plotting against the government.
I don't recognize this shirt. Whose is it?
Everything's happening too quickly.
It's a nice day today.
How much is the express?
Tom really sounds upset.
She would not disclose the secret.
That would be really funny.
What are you reading?
I sure appreciate all your help.
You deserve a medal.
He wrote to me from time to time.
From our point of view, his proposal is reasonable.
I'm always happy.
You can do whatever you like.
How did you manage to do that?
You don't want to keep him waiting.
I tried to cheer him up.
You can bet your boots on that.
Tom is her brother.
Don't tell me you don't know how to drive.
What's it all about?
No one seems to care.
You're foolish.
What's he hiding?
Nobody's busy.
I'm sloshed.
After ten years as business partners, they decided to part ways.
No one asked you.
She rejected him.
I wasn't always happy.
I don't belong here.
His skill qualifies him for the job.
Is this pen yours?
Tom is photogenic, isn't he?
You're very sophisticated.
You were so strong.
If it were not for water, we could not live.
I had a quarrel with him over money.
Tom kissed my hand.
I think we're going to need it all.
There isn't any solution.
I'd like to talk with you.
You have no alternative.
I will go out if it is fine tomorrow.
Suddenly, it became noisy.
He called my name.
Brown is not her natural hair color.
He threatened to take everything I own.
I'm strong enough.
Tell me what to do.
The men's room is on the second floor.
I'd take it if I were you.
How awful!
This hat doesn't fit me.
Let's get together on Sunday.
I wish you could stay the night.
I really am sorry.

They were all there.
There is enough bread for all of you.
I like your painting.
We'll all die sooner or later.
Tom has a wonderful voice.
He will come if you call him.
That would take all day.
Could you write it down, please?
It takes time.
What do you want to study?
It's not just illegal, it's also dangerous.
We adopted a child.
It's about time you were independent of your parents.
The clock is ticking.
She was anxious about his health.
He tricked me.
I have just eaten lunch.
Mine is not so good as yours.
You've been infected.
Few people came to the lecture.
They all have kids.
It's based on a true story.

Do you think I'm healthy?
I've got them all.
He is the richest man on earth.
I nodded to show that I agreed.
The sea is calm.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Your shelf is full of books.
Anyone who says so is a liar.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
I would never do it again.
You must not say it.
You shouldn't break promises.
Can you please shut up?
Tom won't ask you to dance.
We're in luck.
Don't stop him.
How is your weekend going so far?
I'm not doing it anymore.
I borrowed the book from this library.
Treat her well.
I just don't like it.

The new computer is ten times as fast as the old one.
We heard what sounded like gunshots.
The pie is delicious.
I assemble car engines.
They left it to me to decide on a gift.
That sounds awesome.
The washer doesn't fit through the door.
My legs are getting better day by day.
The water turned to ice.
I got confused.
It is necessary for you to go there immediately.
You have a lot of nerve!
A good many people were there.
I finally bought the toy.
I figured you might want this.
I think you're being a little too careful.
Will you please explain the meaning of this sentence to me?
She stared at him with frightened eyes.
The door squeaked.
This rule applies to all cases.
I can't make heads or tails of what you say.
Do you walk to school?
Is there a point?
Nobody's going to hire you.
He drank the whisky as if it were water.
It's time to party.
I need the keys.
He has come from Boston.
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
I'll give you a day to think about it.
It doesn't seem fair, does it?
Are you still mad at me?
What did they hit you with?
Wires carry electricity.
Don't tell your mother.
Lightning lit up the room every now and then.
These shirts are selling like hotcakes.

You can make your dream come true by working hard.
Try not to be so tense.
Why did you leave Australia?
Actually, I'm not quite sure.
Our feud traces back to our childhood.
Let's hope she comes.
I've been looking for it all morning.
I've just eaten some sushi and drunk a beer.
She asked if she could use the phone, so I let her.
I came to wish you good luck.
Keep away from me.
It doesn't look too hard.
I'm not worried about anything.
The President made an address to the nation.
I never thought it'd be this hard to build a picnic table.
He usually looks through the newspapers before breakfast.
You have my sympathies.
Just stick around a few days and you'll come to love this place.
I will do that work on condition that I get paid for it.
I'm friends with Tom's sister.
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
Whose are they?
Frankly speaking, I don't like the idea.
You can't believe everything you hear.
Put more salt in the soup.
You nearly died.
She repeated her name slowly.
How are the negotiations coming along?
No one wanted to talk about it.
After a long argument, I finally gave in.
We're managing.
I see your point.
A little bird told me.
These days, the motives for marriage are not necessarily pure.
He was surprised to learn this.
They were mostly women.
I leave it up to you.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
I'd be happy to discuss it.
Do you think I can pull this off?
Don't be afraid to talk to him.
They are discussing the problem.
We're ready to go.
She showed him the photo.
My cats will love this.
Don't open that door for anybody.

Can you tell me when the next bus will arrive?
Fewer young people know how to write in longhand.
He ate every bit of his dinner.
We're pooped.
Take a seat.
I didn't want to look stupid.
He made a thorough analysis of the problem.
Will you pass me the salt, please?
Tom doesn't know what to say.
Have you already chosen?
Perhaps you have misunderstood the aim of our project.
You don't have to be a genius to know who said that.
Everyone is in the living room watching TV.
It's a beautiful painting.
I thought we weren't going to do this.
Don't tell me what I know.
This container is completely watertight.
I think Tom needs medical attention.
I think Tom wants to come with us.
Things went great last night.
Go put some clean clothes on.

I need that as soon as possible.
You're being bossy, aren't you?
What else is new?
Tom didn't have enough money to go home by bus.
I didn't hear him coming.
She'll be just fine.
He forgot that he bought her a present.
You are a good cook, aren't you?
Do you have any advice for me?
Are you going to tell me your name?
I bought a scarf for my grandfather for his 88th birthday.
You have friends who can help you, don't you?
I made fun of him.
It's all coming back to me.
What is all this?
I love to play golf.
I messed up.
You're so picky.
We must start at once.
Anywhere with a bed will do.
If you rest, you will be back on your feet again soon.
The president is fully aware of the situation.
The students disobeyed their teacher.
What time should I go to the airport?
I can't do what they do.
Where are you going on vacation?
Brush your teeth at least twice a day.
You will always be welcome.
I always wonder what happened to him.
They made equally tough demands.
He tried to unify the various groups.
Acid eats into metal.
I'm very worried about your health.
Do you plan to stay long?
The policeman was confronted by the angry mob.
Is somebody there?
Leave my things alone.
Tom stepped into the elevator and pushed the button for the third floor.
I came for you.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
I don't want to die.
Obviously, you volunteered.

The rain prevented me from coming.
There's a restaurant here.
The dog kept me from approaching his house.
I don't know where my keys are.
What kind of woman do you think I am?
I'm sorry, but can't answer right away.
Thanks to all of you.
I want to get married, just not to you.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
I will learn.
We skipped his turn on purpose.
He decided not to go.
I love to go to the movies.
Don't be scared of making mistakes.
She looks very happy.
We're the best.
I don't feel like trying.
I have a reservation for six-thirty.
Please don't leave valuable things here.
Father always says, "Do your best."
Who knows what he'll accomplish if given the chance?
Tell me what really happened.
You think of everything.

Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
What's your favorite word?
He asked me to wake him at six.
Have you taken a bath yet, Takashi?
We were greeted by a cute waitress.

Do you have the time?
The lunar month is shorter than the calendar month.
He can't stay long.
This word comes from Latin.
I hope you agree.

Have you ever been there?
Most young people have mobile phones.
I don't ever want to talk about it.
It's easy for monkeys to climb trees.
You should not do such a thing.
In this case, let's go.
The store is closed Mondays.
That incident made him famous.
I like what you did.
Something very strange is going on.
I didn't mean to kill him.
You're all right.
I'll take it all.
You may as well leave at once.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
I just want to say I love you.
We ask the teacher questions every day.

Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
Tom will find you.
These are mine.
Dinner will be served on board the plane.
That was very reassuring.
The air conditioner seems to be working now.

Be discreet.

I hear a dog barking in the woods.
I feel much safer now.

What do you remember?
I changed my hairstyle.
You might not find it.

She has brought up five children.
Will you eat dinner?
Everything he says is true.
You're a prude.

Who should I call?
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
She is unsociable.
Don't wait for me.
There are 31 days in December.

Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?

How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
An old friend of mine visited yesterday.
She hit me, not him.
You are taller than she is.
That's what friends are for.
My mother taught me how to make miso soup.
You should allow an hour to get to the airport.
What a bummer!
I'm a busy person.

They needed to trade with them for food.
I'll never come back.
She witnessed him being killed.
I fed my dog what I thought was good quality dog food.

I wasn't responsible.
This is a problem for elderly people.
I don't know what you're interested in.

Get on your feet.

Here I am.
Could you show me the way to the station?
He has a bicycle.

Why would anybody eat pickled cabbage?
They're a good team.
The view from the top of the mountain was breathtaking.
You were bluffing, weren't you?
You don't have to explain.
I've got some very good news.
I'm skinny.
I know every inch of New York.
They trusted you.
Here comes the train.
How can you be so selfish?
You're not that interesting.
We have to do this the right way.
You're very funny.
There are no comments yet.
He puts aside some money every month.
Tom arrived first.
An atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
Thanks for the hint.
Many people do this.
She teaches students English.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I'll have to catch the 8:15 train to Paris.
How do you spell your last name?
He made the company what it is today.
Don't get me started.
I can't get the car to start.
What a joke!
All the furniture was covered with dust.
The disagreement between the union and management could lead to a strike.
I just need to blow off some steam.
What do you say to taking a walk in the park?
I bike to work.
I want you.
All I think about is you.
Please put on your shoes.
He keeps all his savings in the bank.
We're ready now.
I love what you've done to this place.
I don't feel like partying.
I want to send this by registered mail.
How many hours is the flight?
Have you ever seen the man in this photo?
He died one year ago.
He likes hunting.
For the time being, I intend to stay at a hotel.
I used to respect you.
Don't forget the drinks.
I won't come back again.
Have they spotted you?
They are disappointed in their son.
Tom didn't go to the hospital.
He is my close friend.
I don't see why I have to go to your house at midnight.
Did you get fired from your last job?
I want to know why this happened.
Her father is tall.
The fire broke out after the staff went home.
I've got you.
Don't act like that.
Tom has far more experience than Mary.
We were playing chess.
She always buys expensive clothes.
Are you flirting with him?
If you wouldn't mind, I could use a hand.
I think Tom is going to be OK.
I wasn't the only one who was late.
I have no idea who he is.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Tom didn't look as happy as Mary.
I don't think I can do that.
That's her.
Do you have your laptop with you?
OK, let's assume you're right.
He'll be just fine.
It is a difficult problem.
You're the oldest.
I have a car.
Where do you come from?
I forgot to buy a birthday cake.
I guess what I've said isn't all that clear, but that's the only way I can explain it.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
Is there a mall near here?
I can't praise him enough.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
I started a fire right away.
How long has it been since your divorce?
I will go tomorrow morning at seven.
Gold is heavier than silver.
Am I bothering you?
I was jealous of my brother.
Is this your first trip abroad?
The rule holds good in this case.
You really have a talent for translation.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
I know what to expect.
How am I supposed to dress?
Take the chair to your room.
That was perfectly normal.
She likes him.
Tom still wants you to help him.
Nobody likes war.
I plan to go to her cocktail party.
We're on our way home.
Spiders scare me.
You must be very hungry now.
Is it cruel to declaw your cat?
He knocked on the door.
Do you have any water?
You didn't tell me Tom smoked.
You can't just leave your car parked in front of the fire hydrant.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
Tom was charged with drunken driving after he was involved in a car accident in Boston.
Don't burst my bubble.
Are you certain?
We need to get away from here.
I was alone in the classroom.
I think you're interesting.
He excelled in music even as a child.
Please breathe through your nose.
School is over now.
It doesn't look good at all.
Meet me at the hotel bar.
We have just a tiny bit of garden.
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
I advised him to keep that promise.
You have no cause for anger.
Is Tom still aboard?
I felt a little stiff.
Who planned that trip?
I know that wasn't the answer you wanted.
It is getting warmer and warmer.
The sky grew darker and darker.
If only he had known!
Accidents will happen.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
Can you still remember when we first met?
I have three sisters.
We'll help you.
Do you think you could be a cop?
Just don't drop it.
He tried harder to get good marks than I did.
I lost track of all time during our walk in the woods.
Have you ever been arrested?
I don't know whether you're happy or not.
Shouldn't that count for something?
Even the hard-hearted can be moved to tears.
It was so cold yesterday that I stayed home.
That's the way I like it.
Do you want to come in?
I can see the light.
Why are we still talking about this?
I watch TV off and on.
His novel sold well.
I want to drink something cold.
That is almost correct.
I had to lie again.
Have a little dignity.
I really mean it.
I can't recall her name at the moment.
They've bet the farm on it.
Don't sound so surprised. You know I can do whatever I want to do.
I can't study anywhere in my house. It's too noisy.
We baked it together.
I really do have to get back to work.
You're not good at this.
Please air the futon.
I asked Tom to go to the supermarket and buy some bread.
You're on to something.
Everybody in the world desires peace.
She blackmailed him.
You should read between the lines.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
This fish has a bad smell.
You're no help.
I have lost my key.
I spent two hours watching a baseball game on TV last night.
Dance with me.
His socks are gray.
He thought up an excuse.
So, do you like it?
We're dedicated.
It doesn't ring a bell.
Tom won a large sum of money.
That's what I think.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.
I usually drive myself to work.
He concentrated on that.
That is not how we do things here.
Come down here.
Men are pigs.
I'm not busy either.
She is getting better day by day.
He would let me help him.
We have had a lot of snow this winter.
He is looked up to as their leader.
I never for a moment imagined that I would win.
Watch where you're going!
Bring me the phone, Tom.
Take as many cookies as you want.
That's why we want you.
Go away before they see you here.
I will come with you.
"How did you get in here?" "I climbed in through the window."
The stream is not very swift.
That tradition has fallen by the wayside.
I went to the hospital yesterday.
Air is to us what water is to fish.
You didn't warn me.
We hired a company to get rid of the insects under our house.
Please fill out this form.
Why don't they just come and get us?
Tom asked how much the ticket cost.
You will soon get accustomed to your new school.
I canceled it.
I'm not ready to die.
The meaning of this sentence is obscure.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
She was advised by him not to go.
I want to go there once more.
It came to nothing.
She altered her plans.
Will you have some coffee?
Get on your bike.
You're blocking my view.
I think we're being followed.
I don't know the reason why he was absent.
Do you still remember how to do it?
She decided to have surgery.
You must tell me.
I'm reading the newspaper.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
I would rather die than marry him.
She looked after her sister, who was in bed with a bad cold.
I sleep standing up.
You talk so fast I can't understand a word you say.
The doctors said he would never again be able to walk without some support.
How many were wounded?
Yesterday, a thief entered the house.
I ran downstairs.
Let the children play.
You're pretty good.
Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life.
"I feel like playing cards." "So do I."
I'm a beginner, too.
I'm not at all surprised.
She was on the verge of crying.
Perhaps Tom can help you find a job.
Get out of here quickly!
It's never too late to make amends for harm done.
If you want to lose weight, the best thing to do is to eat properly and get a lot of exercise.
I'm leaving for Canada tomorrow.
Tom struggled to climb to the top.
Karaoke is good for reducing stress.
That's my car.
How well can you dance?
Tom split up with Mary.
Tom told Mary that it was over.
They're cousins.
Cost is a definite factor in making our decision.
You'll be fine.
We had fun with it.
Did I embarrass you?
How long will you stay here?
I can not feel at home in a luxurious hotel.
Tom has been expelled from school.
I said all along that he was not a person to be trusted, but you would not listen to me.
Just keep moving.
Check these out.
I'll stay here until ten.
How old is this tree?
From now on, there is no reason to worry any more.
May I do it right now?
Does this look good on me?
In the winter, I like to stay at home near the fire and listen to the wind blow.
You had better go to bed now.
I second the motion.
You are rich.
I want to keep one.
I think it's time for you to grow up.
I like walking by myself.
This room is too small for us.
Lake Geneva is the largest lake in Switzerland.
I don't know why he said that to me.
I don't like who you've become.
On hearing the news, she turned pale.
He saved us all.
I had the chance to buy that, but I decided not to.
That made Tom pretty mad.
My headache has gone.
They found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.
I missed my flight.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
I used to look up to him, but not anymore.
I want you to stop following me.
I didn't catch your last name.
Would you buy that?
It's over between us.
I was meaning to ask you about that.
I guess we're finished.
We're all sure of that.
I'm not allowed to say anything.
Tom pays his taxes.
I like watching Tom dance.
You're very wise.
I'm fully aware of that fact.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
The only person who hasn't paid is you.
I think my German is really bad.
Once a species goes extinct, it's gone forever.
Who did you meet?
I'm not asleep.
You're still young.
Concentrate, Tom.
Why are you so happy?
You look European.
The rule does not apply in our case.
We can win.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
He kept his promise.
I think she will succeed as a lawyer.
It's my dream to win a Nobel Prize.
That doesn't sound so good to me.
Give me a hand.
Why were you in prison?
It is a pity you cannot come.
You're safe.
The government should invest more money in industry.
Will it fit?
I lit the candle.
We're not your enemy.
What was he doing here?
Take whatever you want.
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
Didn't you used to be a teacher?
We're both insane.
Sometimes I wonder whether or not there's a point to all of this.
Don't be fresh to me.
I'm not in good shape.
He comes to see me nearly every day.
If you were able to go camping with us, I think we'd all have fun.
Tom drinks milk every morning.
His new film is disappointing.
He is lying on the sofa.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
It was sunny yesterday.
I intended to have finished the work.
I speak from experience.
He's after me.
She lived with him all her life.
She hid the secret from her husband all her life.
He gave her a foot massage.
Is there a reason that you're asking?
I'm already done.
Tom wanted to cry.
Stop doing that.
I ran so I would be on time.
Does anyone know you're here?
That's why I'm a bachelor.
I don't know exactly where.
The TV doesn't work.
I'd say you're jealous.
He's stalling for time.
He hurt his hand when he fell.
She was blackmailed by him.
We took turns in washing the car.
We must go.
Do you understand me?
We were tired out after our long walk.
You shouldn't read in such poor light.
The traveler stopped to ask me the way.
They already know.
Have you ever been mugged?
I arrived ahead of the others.
Do you like to travel?
The kitten lapped up the milk I poured into the saucer.
It's a complete sham.
Tom is always cheerful.
Hurry up! I don't have all day.
We're sneaky.
You've already forgotten.
Does your head hurt?
We can't leave Tom here. He won't survive on his own.
You should get yourself examined by the doctor immediately.
Who spoke?
I tried to help him.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Can you walk with your eyes closed?
What a selfish woman!
I've got a busy schedule.
Don't come to me now with that. You should have said something when it originally happened.
Do you feel like going to the theater?
She always speaks in English.
I've been dying to see him.
He gave me what money he had with him.
His concert was very good.
Would you mind if I took a break?
I want to ask them when their big day is.
The dress in the window caught my eye.
Unfortunately she already has a steady boyfriend.
Join us.
He is afraid to swim.
There are many people living in this house.
I've never seen that before.
Are there any English magazines in this library?
Don't you have a sense of justice?
Why don't you quit?
I'm no one's girlfriend.
Have you seen the dog? He wandered off a couple of minutes ago.
The crowd is growing larger and larger.
They plan to have a party.
I regret nothing.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
This book deals with China.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
You won't have a choice.
We've got to figure out what's wrong.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
I will finish the work in five days.
What if something goes wrong?
I have an idea for a song.
I've had a good day so far.
Children need loving.
I would rather not go.
That was my intent.
Let's go as soon as it stops raining.
He stretched out his arm to take the book.
Give me your address.
Let's leave the decision to our teacher.
I have not more than three thousand yen.
They already got married.
Does truth matter?
You're no different.
You are a good person.
Why did they hire you?
Our ownership in the company is 60%.
Who're you calling now?
This is an extremely important point.
She told him all about her childhood.
How can you be so optimistic?
We must think over the issues carefully.
They are talking about what they will sing.
I've been in China for less than a month.
Have you decided?
He doesn't need to know.
They've changed the rules.
Never give up on your dreams.
I got so wasted last night.
Don't make me ask you again.
English is not easy, but it is interesting.
It's the only way.
That is not your knife.
Count me in.
Can I persuade you to stay a few more days?
You surprised everybody.
You had a week to finish this.
That sounds like a great idea.
I went to school.
I am a bachelor.
What are these for?
It's entirely up to you.
Excuse me, what time is it?
Since I couldn't pay the rent, I asked him for help.
She choked him with her bare hands.
I can't put up with her any longer.
Tom made that himself.
Why don't you take a picture?
Nobody told me you were here.
Tom will be cremated tomorrow.
I was obliged to go out yesterday.
I don't remember anything.
I thought you'd always wanted to see this movie.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
Most young adults enjoy going out at night.
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
Don't worry about me.
The price of vegetables varies from day to day.
I read a lot of modern authors.
He cried and cried.
What's in the bucket?
I would do it again.
We are the best.
I have something of yours.
It's later than you think.
Nobody encouraged her.
The price of gold varies from day to day.
No amount of training can prepare you for this.
Tom's eyes were glued to the screen.
He is a brave man.
What are you drinking?
Is there anything you'd like to add?
He always speaks well of her.
That's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
Tom is trying to quit.
It makes me feel dirty.
Are you sure that's necessary?
I just don't know what to say.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
Come here before seven o'clock.
I told you I didn't do it.
I tossed and turned all night.
I thought you'd be alone.
They're wrong.
She died in a bike accident.
She's a beauty.
Has anybody solved this mystery?
He must have left the water running.
I feel so much better.
Can you go faster?
Don't let anything stand between you and success.
We lost.
Open your book to page nine.
You're not fooling anybody.
Why did I trust you?
He has a hairy chest.
His face turned white.
She looked him straight in the eyes.
You're very understanding.
She advised him not to borrow money from his friends.
I used to be the same age as you.
It's a world record.
Don't make fun of them.
I never thought that would happen.
He often goes to Tokyo.
I was thinking about getting married.
Who sent you?
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me.
Don't keep me waiting.
I kept my mouth shut.
How should I know?
Nobody came to help me.
What difference does it make if people are looking at us?
I'd never met Tom before this morning.
How long were you at the party?
He writes letters to his mother.
Grandpa bought it for me!
Tom closed his eyes again.
I just want what's best for you.
I'm not who you think I am.
Help me pick out a tie to go with this suit.
This seems too good to be true.
You were sleeping, weren't you?
What position do you hold?
Tom swears a lot.
Come if you can.
Is this wine from Argentina?
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
Why don't you grow up?
He took off his glasses.
I was speechless.
Boys, be ambitious.
It was everything I hoped for.
I drank milk.
Forget I said anything.
He always sings in the shower.
Let's run to the bus stop.
Is it yours?
What a pity it is that you can't come!
She's starting to annoy me.
She's an independent thinker.
You're a mighty good feller.
You shouldn't have gone fishing today.
Do you feel any better?
I'm not sure, but he might come.
I suppose you are right.
Is this fake?
I wish I had listened to your warnings.
You can't do it by yourself.
It's all our fault.
I have a student visa.
I'll follow you.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
There's no evidence.
Will you please let me go now?
Don't ask for money.
She grabbed him by the hand.
The brain needs a continuous supply of blood.
I only told you, no one else.
Don't people tell you you look like Audrey Hepburn?
I was happy to hear the news.
She was satisfied with the new dress.
Do you get it?
I've never seen you so happy.
I thought I was alone here.
Am I getting sloppy or what?
Keep me in the loop.
I found a French-Hebrew dictionary at a small bookstore.
I fractured my arm.
I hate my voice.
Lead the way.
Do you think I'm to blame?
She looked excited.
I've had enough.
I didn't really care about that.
They asked his older brother to help them do their homework.
There were no fences on the great plains.
Don't even think of asking me what I think about you right now.
He ran as fast as he could.
We must make up for the loss in some way.
What does it mean?
Cows supply us with milk.
I have to remember to mail the letter.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
I scribbled down his address in the back of my diary.
What time will the flight arrive in Tokyo?
I'm getting married in October.
This time, you've gone too far.
You need to do more research.
They hoped for even better days to come.
He told me the story of his life.
What were you two doing?
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
I caught a glimpse of him in the crowd.
You could stop this.
How can I quit this job?
I asked him if he was busy.
He skipped a grade.
I haven't gotten over my bad cold yet.
My dress was ruined when it came back from the cleaner's.
I'm from Colombia.
Tom came into the room without knocking on the door.
Do you want to do it together?
Do you still want to give me a hug?
You can't eat here.
I've been following you.
Tom knows who we are.
Hurry up, girls.
You may not believe it, but it is nonetheless true.
Can you prove the allegations?
Tom is terrible at cooking.
I have absolutely nothing to do.
Do your homework right now.
How are we feeling today?
I was ready to do it.
The ice on the lake is too thin to bear your weight.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
Do you have any children?
I want to go.
I want to see your boss.
I wish I were in Paris now.
Tom is lying on the sofa watching TV.
You don't need to explain that.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
Tom can't speak French well.
She forced him to sit down.
You're the one who planted that tree.
It's not possible.
Do not say such foolish things.
I wonder where he has gone.
Why don't you take off your coat?
I've tried everything.
Tom and Mary were both alcoholics.
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.
He goes running every morning.
I was surprised at the news of his sudden death.
I didn't lose much time.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I'm very upset.
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
It was a gift.
Are you being serious?
What are you cooking?
Was his story true?
He is tall and handsome.
In the United States, it takes a minimum of eight years of college to become a medical doctor.
I really miss my girlfriend.
They did a good job.
This isn't enough.
Can you do some shopping for me?
I usually have dinner at seven.
Is that why they died?
I stretched out my legs.
What else is on the agenda?
I finally understand the basic principles of calculus.
Give me your belt.
Tom looks happier today.
These books aren't just for children.
Can you swim as fast as he can?
I know an English teacher who comes from Canada.
Whose house is across from yours?
I have to be back home by seven.
We've seen this happen too many times.
I'm giving you an opportunity.
Didn't you hear your name called?
The cat doesn't look happy to see us.
We can't kill Tom.
It's not my style.
The plane was late due to bad weather.
I was in my room studying.
I showed her my room.
You need sleep.
I disposed of my old coat.
We were looking for Tom.
He can be proud of his father.
Please explain it.
It'll be better.
Wait for us.
Fill it with regular, please.
I think Tom is in love with me.
He ate all of it.
We've run out of food.
You're very sophisticated.
You must find work.
Can you do bookkeeping?
We heard gunshots from next door.
How's your wife?
According to the Bible, God made the world in six days.
What he said made us angry.
I can't believe Tom is still single.
There's no mistake.
Why did you come to Japan?
They never tell a lie.
When did you notice that?
Can I have a few minutes, please?
Why don't you read it for yourself?
Have you ever donated blood?
You should eat more.
We're very busy.
According to him, she is honest.
Everyone is not honest.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
If you see Tom, please tell him for me.
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.
Stop making a fuss.
I can not answer your question.
Do you like it?
He was willing to help others.
He was displeased with his neighbor.
If my brother hadn't helped me, I would've drowned.
I thought your parents liked me.
I'd like to buy a good dictionary.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
He said he would not come in, but he came in after all.
That bicycle over there is my brother's.
As is often the case with him, he came late.
I'm flabby.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
Take this medicine after each meal.
I'm here to help you.
I like to be thorough.
Let's go straight to the beach.
She laid her baby on the bed.
I never really knew Tom.
Won't you have some more tea?
She did not marry the man.
Let's see how the negotiations pan out before we decide.
He almost never went there.
Give me some more tea.
Can you open the window?
I'll visit you at your office tomorrow.
Where did you put your key?
I leave it up to you.
Don't stand up.
I can't work with Tom.
He was tenacious.
Don't be upset.
It was excruciating.
I appreciate the hospitality.
This dress would look good on you.
Get on your knees.
I'm worried about my weight.
Would you mind rubbing my feet?
I just took a shower.
I want to sit down for a change.
It was pretty obvious.
Why are you questioning me?
I can't believe how beautiful you are.
She is very nervous and is always ill at ease.
I felt happy.
It wasn't all that funny.
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
The doctor examined over fifty patients that day.
Don't shoot.
She agreed with him that I should go to the meeting.
Are you sure you're not tired?
This is my fate.
Tom said you were lonely.
Don't run.
I don't have the money.
These books are ours.
Is your headache gone?
Don't talk during class.
My mother made me study for three hours last night.
You were very busy, weren't you?
I'll join you later.
Do you know where he lives?
I like your article.
She went to bed early.
I've seen all your movies.
Did you go out?
That's why I sent for you.
Haiti is a nation that seems hopelessly impoverished.
Your story is hard to believe.
The cook put the food in the dumb waiter.
Is it always this cold?
I think you're nuts.
I don't have any sisters.
Everyone wants to be young and attractive.
Ask for what you want!
I'm certainly not your friend.
We shouldn't leave anything to chance.
I asked my mother if breakfast was ready.
If camping doesn't float your boat, then you probably don't want to spend the weekend with us.
Why don't you ever cook?
I did see him.
He deserves the prize.
Would you like to talk about what just happened?
My schedule is really tight right now.
The murderer is still at large.
You're kind of cute.
You still haven't told me where you live.
I feed my dog meat at least once a week.
I've had a very busy morning.
I need hand lotion.
I'd like to reserve a seat on this train.
Keep your hands clean.
Basketball was my favorite sport in high school.
We're going to have to make some very tough choices.
He recommended this dictionary to me.
I think Tom needs me.
They don't want you to know.
What did the boy say?
I hope you stop telling me lies.
Last week's meeting was the longest we have had this year.
I just want to be your friend.
I myself didn't have to go and meet him there.
Do you remember what you were watching?
Stop joking around.
Tom wanted that.
I don't have anything else.
We don't need you.
What a shame!
Dinosaurs once ruled the earth.
I'm involved.
I've been waiting for Tom for a long time.
I want to check it out.
Don't make me do it again.
Tom has big lips.
This is the town where he was born.
It's time to leave.
She's scared of dogs.
Are you sure about this?
He went to see her the other day.
We try our best.
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof.
I helped out.
Tom knows he's not going to win.
Don't laugh at him for making a mistake.
The boy who had been missing was identified by his clothes.
I think it's a possibility.
The accident happened two hours ago.
Who sings the best of all the boys in your class?
I was threatened.
What kinds of goods do you sell in your shop?
Do I need to go right away?
I nailed it.
Smoking is not permitted here.
My dad will kill me.
He did not have enough money.
Did you know she is good at making coffee?
I haven't seen you around before.
Tom doesn't like me.
Let's meet in front of the library.
The rich are not always happier than the poor.
Tom is bilingual.
Do you like anchovies?
I think it's time for me to discuss the matter with him.
We will get to Tokyo Station at noon.
I only found out a couple days ago.
Quit behaving like a kid.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
There are few sounds in this world more beautiful than a baby's laugh.
Why did you like it?
I want facts.
I'd like to speak to your manager.
Are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
He worked hard in order to pass the examination.
I'd like to check your blood pressure.
Are you lonely?
I just changed my mind. That's all.
You're here early.
I can handle this.
I can't believe I'm really here.
We haven't seen each other for such a long time.
You'll have a wonderful time.
No criminal charges will be filed against you.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
He didn't look like a clever boy.
Hold that thought.
He studied for ten years.
We talked.
I want my children to be happy.
I wish he would write more often.
I don't know how many more times I'll be able to do this.
She wants to hug him.
Stop! You're hurting him!
My right shoulder hurts.
I thought you lived with your family.
Remember it.
Transplants save lives.
Don't talk to me.
I'll work hard.
I am not certain about that.
I don't believe Atlantis ever existed.
I can't get rid of this cold.
I'm not quite done here.
I've been doing this longer than you.
How can you be so cruel?
That's mine.
Would you like to go to a movie tonight?
Don't talk to anyone.
Tom makes big money.
Can I make you a drink?
My house is nice.
She is as young as I am.
I'd like to get you both to help me.
Get out of my way.
The worst thing you can do is to only do something half seriously.
Your face is red.
It's almost six o'clock.
He made a mistake.
The old man is hard to please.
It's dark in here.
He earns three times more than I do.
Get out of here! All of you!
You hurt my feelings.
We made waffles.
Add 5 and 2, and you get 7.
There's a movie I want to watch on TV tomorrow night.
Many fish died.
She punished her children.
I don't like the way he looks at you.
I thought you'd got lost.
My goal in life is to be a novelist.
You're not that interesting.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
He examined the spare parts one by one.
She left home ten minutes ago.
She was close to breaking into tears.
Are you willing to take that chance?
Love is not a crime.
Thank you for stopping by.
I thought I was going to die.
I've been very busy since this morning.
They stayed at a very expensive hotel.
I found the test difficult.
Boys, don't make any noise.
A man who speaks the truth needs a fast horse.
I am a teacher.
She abstains from drinking.
I realize I'm just stating the obvious.
I won't be gone long.
Your son is a genius.
What a surprise!
Be there tonight.
Stop, or I'll shoot.
She has no fear.
We're nearly there.
It did not end well.
To be happy, you should spend time with someone you love.
Please don't distract me from my work.
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Are you finished with your work?
She often calls him names.
I just want my past to go away.
Where are our umbrellas?
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
Two families live in that house.
I thought you might come.
I pay taxes.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
He's cunning and manipulative.
Do I annoy you?
Is anyone else going?
I think you must be mistaken.
Get out of here quickly!
I never stop thinking about you.
Things happened very quickly.
I do feel pretty good.
I love winning.
When do you plan to start?
Italy is a peninsula.
I can hear you.
Tom drank three bottles of wine by himself last night.
That's what I need to know.
Do you like the way you look?
One of them is probably lying.
He treats me like a child.
I asked her out on a date.
I must find some new friends.
Do you have a car?
What does that have to do with me?
I want to see your house.
We'll try one more time.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Sputnik was launched on October 4, 1957.
How many men do you have?
What she said wasn't true.
I'll tell you.
I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never came.
I hope that he will help me.
Is it a deal?
It wasn't expensive.
Please be careful.
I think he needs to go there.
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
Where is your sister?
My car broke down on the way.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
We could read.
Do you want to sleep on the couch?
She agreed with him on what to do with the old car.
This elevator is out of order. Please use the stairs.
What are you doing in my room?
Tom was sitting at his desk.
We took advantage of the fine weather to play tennis.
Tom took my money.
I thought you were smart.
Food is still scarce in the region.
Say that again, please.
She will report directly to me.
He did not answer the phone, so I sent him an email.
This probably means war.
That may not be so easy.
Tom was sitting alone in his room.
He felt very lonely.
He is, without question, the best man for the job.
I'm exercising.
We are in a library.
She was advised by him to lose weight.
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 and she wasn't happy about that.
I wasn't present at the meeting.
I saw a man with a child.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Let go of it.
Please help yourself to the cookies.
Enjoy your day.
The comic scenes in the play were overdone.
Your room is big.
There is no way of reaching the island other than by boat.
We're on our way.
You should follow Tom's example.
Let's not pretend otherwise.
She broke the cup, too.
Tom went into the room first.
While swimming in the pool, she lost her locker key.
Would you like it washed?
Tom asked Mary if she loved him.
Do you need money?
I do not read books.
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
She married a musician.
Tom took a cold shower.
Stay a while and listen.
When do you think he'll be back?
Do you mean you don't find that odd?
Dead men tell no tales.
You must find work.
I may be wrong.
Let's try to make our world better.
You've got to be kidding!
I need an envelope.
He adapted himself to his new life.
I played with the baby on my knee.
I suppose it couldn't be helped.
A person's soul is immortal.
I'd like to forget the whole thing.
We had to gear our lives to the new circumstances.
We don't meet very often recently.
Please don't tell my wife.
I envy you so much.
Is it true that Boston is a popular destination for tourists?
I have to take some money out of the bank.
I'm sorry, but my mother is out at the moment.
I am truly sorry.
Tom remembered everything.
Somebody's coming.
I have a feeling he is right.
Tom still doesn't believe it.
Come off it!
Wait one second.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I swear to you I will never do it again.
I've never even had a girlfriend.
I don't know how I've offended you.
This place isn't so bad.
What's wrong with the way I'm dressed?
Why are you lying?
Everyone was stunned.
I've been following you.
I heard a cotton candy shop has just opened. Let's go, dudes.
We listened to music yesterday.
You'll come back, won't you?
He made mistake after mistake.
I hate dancing.
I've got plenty of money.
She became happy.
I used to live near a park.
He has little money with him.
We're concerned for your safety.
I'm glad to hear of your success.
I understand it.
That's why I didn't want to come here.
I don't want to live with you anymore.
All in all, the novel was a success.
I feel the same way as you do.
Are you tired?
My brother sends you his regards.
We are the same age, but different heights.
Mary treated her wounded knee.
Tom is quite authoritative.
I can not answer your question.
Don't do anything stupid.
How did you become involved in this project?
The medicine made me sleepy.
I'll be free all day tomorrow.
Reading books is my hobby.
I want to know who started it.
You are very insensitive.
Am I wasting my time?
I usually eat rice with chopsticks.
If that happened, what would you do?
I thought he wouldn't recognize her.
I cannot accept this gift.
He left the room without saying a word.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
Don't worry. You can count on me.
He mentioned it.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
What's your daughter's name?
Everybody was stunned.
How big is the team?
We're not ready for this.
He cheated on me.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Keep away from the fire.
I will tell him the news as soon as I see him.
"Will they go on strike again?" "I'm afraid so."
I no longer want to live in Boston.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
Beat it, kids!
I like this color.
I don't need your permission to do this.
Let me get you the key.
If I can do it, so can you.
He worked hard to save up some money.
You like it, don't you?
I suppose I'd do the same thing if I were you.
What's that your wearing?
Beauty is subjective.
She will be glad if you go to see her in person.
He could read me like an open book.
It's a very good question.
He has a lot of things to do.
Next time, I'll do it myself.
The park is in the center of the city.
I want cash.
Aren't you hungry?
I like to be thorough.
Don't put off those matters.
I never win.
I woke you up.
It may have been Tom that wrote this note.
The band starts playing at 8:00 p.m.
It just doesn't look right.
I'm here, aren't I?
Would you like to leave a message?
They can't do that.
He went back to the store.
Whoever told you that is a liar.
I can do this.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
I saw him there.
They're still young.
What other choice did I have?
I'm not busy.
Look at your map.
That joke isn't funny.
Close the door, please.
I had a problem to take care of.
Do we have to be so formal?
Wait, why am I telling you this?
Your English has improved considerably.
Tom made Mary cry.
I have some things to take care of.
I'd love to get rid of this old car.
She stood up.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Why don't you start by telling us what you saw?
I didn't sleep long enough.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
One must do one's best in everything.
I can't believe I listened to you.
It was stupid of you to believe him.
The lecture started on schedule.
I am familiar with your name.
He gave me an example.
I work at a language school.
We have a lot of good restaurants here in Boston.
I forgot to tell you who would meet you at the station.
Can you help me to translate these sentences into Chinese?
I'll support him.
She was appointed chairperson.
You'd better not stay up too late.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I thought I would find you there.
He always sings while taking a shower.
Stop being so nice.
Do you have any more of those?
Is it not black?
Tom wanted Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
Lie on the bench for a while with your eyes closed.
What happened to you?
She married an American GI after the war.
I think I must be leaving since it is getting late.
I was tired, but I couldn't sleep.
There is an urgent need for people to help clean up the environment.
He played an important role on the committee.
I thought the game was over.
I have two sons and two daughters.
We have tried everything.
How have you been getting along lately?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
This should be more than enough.
I wanted you to keep that.
She has gone, but I still love her.
I talked with her for an hour.
According to a recent study, the average life span of the Japanese is still increasing.
I don't get it.
I like to ride on trains.
I guess the dog bites.
People notice every move he makes.
There wasn't a soul in sight.
We will not fail.
It's really not that cold.
I feel so happy when I'm with you.
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
I only need one.
I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen.
They're doctors.
Do you think it works?
I have enjoyed reading this novel.
I called you.
He bought a bottle of cheap wine.
Do you think we should abandon ship?
We enjoy talking.
No matter how hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can.
What are you called?
I thought you wouldn't like it.
Everyone loves him.
His wife doesn't seem ugly to me.
I thought of you immediately.
He made an apology.
This city is 1,600 meters above sea level.
I'm convinced.
I went inside.
He overcame many difficulties.
Let's try another place to eat today.
There's a cure for everything, except death.
I'm surviving.
It's new.
No one knew what to do.
The failure is due to his carelessness.
What are you doing?
You are such a sweetheart.
She drank two glasses of wine at the party.
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
These problems will be solved in the near future.
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
You're resilient.
Let me in.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
I'm not going to close the door.
Stay with me.
I should get back to work.
These are serious difficulties.
I would like to charter a yacht.
He's your typical workaholic.
He helped me move.
Check it out!
Which club do you belong to?
Can this possibly be the right address?
The auto industry is hiring again.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
He was unimpressed.
Of course she can speak English.
So, do you like it?
Let's postpone until next week.
I fell sound asleep before I knew it.
We got too close.
You're out of booze.
You're articulate.
I live pretty close to Tom.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
His ID was fake.
I saw Tom a few minutes ago and he looked tired.
He is afraid of becoming sick.
I'll introduce you.
Someone spiked her drink.
Nobody heard the bell ring.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Please give me a cup of coffee.
He asked me to speak more slowly.
I had a really great time last night.
I have two big brothers.
Don't lie to me.
Don't try to do too much.
We're pooped.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
Would you mind lending me your car?
Where're the shoes?
Tickets are valid for just two days, including the day they are purchased on.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
He tendered his resignation.
Who broke this?
Tom was caught selling drugs to kids.
I'm not easily impressed.
What did his wife say?
Unfortunately, my father isn't at home.
Don't talk in a loud voice here.
Don't worry about a thing.
We're not lost.
I ache all over.
My sister is too young to go to school.
Stop screaming.
I have a brand new pair of socks.
You deserve so much more than this.
It wasn't any bigger than a soccer ball.
It's not real.
Don't let the cat out of the bag.
You're very timid.
Their work seems good to me.
Tom asked Mary to call the police.
I didn't recognize what it was.
Tom has his father's eyes.
Tom is very late, isn't he?
Is what you told me secret?
Please boil the eggs just a little so that even the whites are not quite hard.
Everything's going to be OK.
She advised him to stop taking that medicine.
Whatever you do, don't open that door.
Tom asked me how many guitars I own.
I have no privacy.
We've been invited to a costume party.
She cannot have broken her promise.
My papers were in that box.
At last, we got to the lake.
I work out whenever I can.
There are not many books on these shelves.
I just need you to trust me, OK?
Don't tell anyone we've done this.
I can't wait for school to start.
I hit him in the belly.
Prices these days are extremely high.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
He did not accept their invitation.
This is smaller than that.
There are no tickets left.
Are you sure this is what you want?
What am I supposed to do?
I'm glad I'm not Tom.
Don't talk to me like this.
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
You are blinded by love.
I liked this film.
That guy has a screw loose!
My father often falls asleep while watching television.
Either is acceptable.
I can't do it right away.
The water turned to ice.
I feel ridiculous.
Judging from the look of the sky, it is going to snow.
Tom read the poem out loud.
Is this enough?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
He's not worthy of you.
I have to be back home by seven.
Tell me where you went.
We headed for the mountain cottage.
I could feel nothing but the knife as it plunged into my back.
He is the chief of my department.
I got this job with my teacher's help.
I only study in the library.
You're not dressed.
We spoke briefly.
We're not safe.
Ain't he cute?
I'm very sorry, but I can't.
Tom fell off the chair.
Don't fret.
You fainted.
I think Tom is in the front yard.
Look at it.
Islam first reached China about the middle of the 7th century.
We had a lot of rain last month.
I'll rip your head off!
I feel empty inside.
You're planning something, aren't you?
He is going to be a doctor when he grows up.
Who planted the tree?
This is Tom's third trip to Australia.
I can't trust anybody.
What's your best price?
Can I see you a second?
I don't know if I can do it.
Can you express yourself in English?
His data is often inaccurate.
No one looks busy.
I've got pins and needles in my leg.
A doctor told me that eating eggs was bad for me.
You can have a ride on my motorcycle.
That looks good on you.
Where can I try this on?
I want to workout.
What's your theory on what happened?
After six games, Sampras had the edge on his opponent.
There are not enough chairs for us to sit on.
If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
Do you want me to come cook you something?
I want you to go home.
He stuck to his promise.
Do you know the answer?
You're very wise.
Can anything else be done?
Look, there's a rabbit!
Our guests are in a hurry.
Just think what it could do for you.
You don't have to apologize.
I shouldn't be laughing.
She walked as fast as she could to catch up with him.
I found your letter in the mailbox.
Nobody was injured.
My father objected to our marriage.
I was too small.
He talks a lot.
I hate the color of these walls.
You'll be in trouble.
Smoking is really bad for your health.
No one believed him.
What do you do for a living?
They attacked the enemy.
You're not my friend.
I am good at math.
Are you thinking of going to university?
He pushed the emergency button.
Open these doors.
He was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has a rich vocabulary of English words.
I don't want to shoot you.
Tom told Mary that he had finished the work a few days ago.
There are no more bullets.
He got angry.
I didn't know that you used to work here.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I can't get involved.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
Come into the room after me.
The storm didn't cause any damage.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
I never thought it could happen to me.
Are you excited?
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
I feel kind of hungry.
Every religion prohibits murder.
He muttered something under his breath.
I figured you'd probably never want to see me again.
Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
More tractors meant fewer horses and mules.
He was strict in disciplining his children.
It's inspiring.
You're testing my patience.
What time is it by your watch?
Can you swim?
What's the real reason you're here?
We're sneaky.
I made these clothes myself.
When you make the bed, don't forget to fluff up the pillows.
Would you like me to do something about it?
Don't sneak up on me like that.
I won't tell anybody.
I have children.
That's what I have to do.
Do you hit your children?
I can't afford to buy such an expensive car.
I have a bruise.
You don't expect me to face Tom alone, do you?
I began driving our tractor when I was 12 years old to help my father out at harvest time.
A huge tanker just pulled out from the dock.
Please note that the price is subject to change.
I require advice.
You smoke far too much. You should cut back.
Will you pass me the salt?
It was just an accident that we met at the store.
He could speak French.
Mary is weird.
No one would talk about it.
Will you sell me your house?
Tom gave them a general idea of what he wanted.
I want to make sure I understand what you're saying.
The car ran into a tree.
I don't care why Tom did it. I'm just glad he did.
Apart from that, I don't know anything.
I'm getting the hang of this new machine.
Where can I buy a ticket?
As soon as they return, I will telephone you.
Have a beer with me.
We all know you're smart.
I ran so I would be on time.
I can't get involved.
I'm watching a movie.
Blind people read by touching, using a system of raised dots called Braille.
In the mean time, let's have a sit down.
Tom promised Mary that he'd help her.
I would like to address two questions.
I don't eat breakfast.
Where were you for the whole afternoon?
I want to make her happy.
Tom tried to control his emotions.
Tom is there to help Mary.
It's like being a kid in a candy store.
Please treat the cat well.
My computer suddenly stopped working.
You sound angry.
The bus stop is close by.
I hope all but one of your dreams come true, so you always have something to strive for.
You get paid in proportion to the amount of the work you do.
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
I am delighted to be here.
She put sheets on her bed.
I was a student at that time.
I had my bicycle stolen.
I hope you enjoyed it.
It's important for us to think about the future of the world.
No doubt she will win in the end.
I'm really surprised you got a prize.
She stood as close to him as she could.
They work at night.
He ran at full speed.
The royal wedding was a magnificent occasion.
I want to talk to you, Tom.
He found out the secret.
We all have kids.
If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry.
I don't need your praise.
I'll call you after lunch.
I fixed it.
Basset hounds are gentle dogs.
I saw the two together on several occasions.
Is that you?
It looks like an egg.
How will I recognize you?
Everything about this is wrong.
We're all here.
Why did they hire you?
I've already fed the baby.
I have to know why.
I just wanted to make sure I was right.
Do you like to be kept waiting?
They have been reading an interesting book.
There are not enough doctors to give proper care to the children.
We haven't yet finished what we have to do.
You're too slow.
I want them all shot.
You sure are pretty.
I have some stamps in my bag.
We're in love.
I realized I couldn't win.
I have nothing to lose.
I never stay anywhere long enough to make friends.
He saved me from danger.
You're the only one who can help me.
Practice makes perfect.
What kind of wine do you have?
I am from Portugal.
I should not have done that. It was wrong.
I'm not an alcoholic.
I don't intend to use this any longer.
They're all normal.
I will see him after I get back.
I'm sorry I didn't make it to your party.
He thought of a good solution.
I want to see the director of the company.
What do you plan to do?
We need to talk.
Tom lost control of the car.
I'll permit you to go.
I can't finish the job in so short a time.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
My shift's over.
I appreciate this so much.
He's after me.
It seems that you are not having a good time here.
I know sign language.
Tom stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
We cannot overestimate the value of health.
I actually don't know.
The band is still together.
Winds from the sea are moist.
Do you believe what he said?
He made up his mind to go there.
The baby needs its mother.
I didn't realize you were serious.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
Do you want this?
What exactly are they doing in there?
I wonder who.
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
There is a threat of a storm.
Do you know how the accident happened?
Her name is known all over the world.
The professor is making a phone call.
When did you arrive in Boston?
This is an entirely new problem.
I was new.
You shouldn't eat here.
This is the largest dictionary there is in this library.
I want more days like this.
I will give you this bicycle as a birthday present.
Do you mind if I change the channel?
I just want a little more time.
He gave three wrong answers.
Does Tom believe in God?
I don't believe we've met.
Would you teach me?
Suddenly, a man stepped in front of them.
I've lost patience with Tom.
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
All I want now is a glass of water.
What are you planning to do after this is over?

Are you ready for the trip?
He's two years older than Mary is.
You are really very productive today.
I told Tom to wait in the car.
Tom is the right man for the job.
You are too critical of others' shortcomings.
Here's the money I owe you.
He may come and see us tonight.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
If a man had 11 sheep and all but 9 died, how many sheep would he have left?
I will always remember you.

This is my final offer.
Tom brought us each a gift.
I need it yesterday.

I remember.
I love to eat scallops.

Do you want this or don't you?
It's easy to see why.
What do you need?

We walked ten miles that day.
You take your job too seriously.
He quit smoking for the sake of his health.
Does Tom want to rest?
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
Tie your shoes.
I want to live in Italy.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's over now, right?
I put on my trousers.
Would you like to go out for a drink after work?
Is this serious?
I wonder why tennis is played in mini-skirts.
He went to the dentist.
Go on, Tom, we're listening.
You promised not to be rude to me any more.
We used a barrel for a makeshift table.
I can't endure that noise a moment longer.
That's all you ever say.
What are you saying?
They will have a good laugh when they see you like this.
She was busy with housework.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I just need you to help me.

What is the correct answer?
I'm persevering.

You should eat vegetables.
That was a lot of fun.
Be content.
I like to travel by myself.
We arrived three days ago.
May I say something?
This is the palace the king and queen live in.
Good lumber is hard to find these days.
What scared Tom the most was the thought that he might not be able to walk again.
He wants to talk to you.
Get out of my car.
Didn't you go out?
She fainted, but came to after a few minutes.
Don't make me regret this.
When I was in high school, I used to earn extra money babysitting.
The North won the Battle of Shiloh.
Are you looking?
I'm happy with that.
I've never dated anyone taller than me.
I told you to stay in the house.
What are you trying to hide from me?
You may want to take a few steps back.
You owe me an apology for that.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
You should learn to restrain yourself.
I drink tea, too.
This room has space for fifty people.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
Thanks a heap.
I let my teammates down.
You look like you've just lost your best friend.

She prefers quiet music.
Your hair is beautiful.

Let's get going.
The following was inspired in part by a true story.
I love to teach.
Who are you supposed to be?
Was there enough money?
You've run out of time.
Is she single or married?
He offered his seat to an old woman.
There's an emergency situation.
They struggled.
I'll be watching you.
I really need your help.
Tom dozed off in French class.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
Feed the bird!

He went out of his way to find the house for me.
The vase that he broke is my aunt's.
You are mistaken about that.
I don't think that that's fair.

Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
I just wanted to see what would happen.
He is proficient in Farsi.
She was looking forward to going to a movie with him.

He donated countless pieces to the museum.
There was a cat on the table.
There is a castle in my town.

Tom is schizophrenic.
Please forgive me for forgetting to call you.
You can't live like this.
I wasn't supposed to help my son do his homework, but I did.
It's what you deserve.

How did it get here?
I will do my best.
I love surprises.
Tom fastened his seat belt.
I wish I were young.
Tom has just spotted Mary.
Don't bother me with such trifles.
I wish you a Happy New Year.
I feel bad enough already.
Isn't that what you're here to tell us?
The bus leaves every ten minutes.
Could you tell me your name again?
Who left this mess in the toilet?
I hope you will be completely cured.
You're not fit.
I'm sure Tom will know how to do it.
More than twenty boys went there.
I like blue.
He bowed to the Queen.
Have you told everyone when and where the meeting will be?
I'd like to make it clear that I will not change my mind.

The dog didn't eat the meat.
Tom could hear the phone ringing.
She talked to the chairperson.
Back off.
They're special.
I'd rather die than give you this.

He is tremendously handsome.
I have sisters.
His little sister is very cute, isn't she?
I need more information on this matter.
I'm too drunk to do that.
I have no interest in putting my money into your dreams.
Tom isn't his real name.
Have you made your decision yet?
That's not what I meant either.

I was too astonished to speak.
She's not the marrying type.
Have you got it yet?
Sorry to be late.
You must go to school.
He was sent to prison.
I just didn't want you in here.

It's popular among the elderly.
I'm on the phone with Tom now.
I'm ambitious.
He saw that he was wrong.
The food is delicious.
I know what you could've done.
You're very curious.
Even a loser can dress for success.
Just shut up and listen.

Everyone loves him.
This is not the first time this has happened.
I thought you'd want to take a look.
I was forced to accept his proposal.
He was brought up by her grandmother.

Is that what you said?
We can handle that.
Algebra is a branch of mathematics.

It doesn't look right.
The post office is closed today.
Come in. The door is open.
They are good people.
This novel bores me.
Nobody but you can make me happy.
Tom was the first one here, wasn't he?
You can say whatever you want to.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
I should go home and get some sleep.
Nothing is more pleasant than traveling.
He likes geography and history.
Don't eat like a pig.

I don't like horror movies.
This is how I did it.
Whoever is at the door, please ask him to wait.

You may use my typewriter.
The results are by no means satisfactory.
You never told me that.
He died of natural causes.
Don't you pay attention?

He made a lot of money.
What do you spend a majority of your time doing?
I just don't want to lose you.

That's my favorite excuse.
There is an urgent need for them to update their system.
That was a great movie.
I'm glad to hear that she is unmarried.
Is he sleeping?
He is taller than any other boy in his class.
I can't believe that that just worked.
What are you trying to do?
I only got your letter yesterday.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
I don't understand his reluctance to go.
You're not dead.
I was absolutely stunned.
I just wanted to make sure everyone was awake.
Tom, do you still love me?
I didn't want any of that.
I wasn't really listening.
I'm being serious.
Let me think a minute.
Be prepared.
I can't bear to see her cry.
The higher you go, the lower the temperature.
My son has a black beard.
I'm not mistaken.
It was harder than I thought.
I've always loved you.
Tom is in a good mood today.
How long does it take on foot?
Do you get it?
You've already given me enough money.
I think we've wasted enough of your time.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
I said it in jest.
What a pity!
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
I have no idea why he quit his job suddenly.
Who's that cute guy?
Just try it out.
I think Tom had a good reason.
If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
We can all dream.
We'd like you to sing some songs.
Don't laugh.

Is this normal behavior?
The basket was full of apples.
You're supposed to be resting.
You have to pay taxes.
I'll always be here for you.
I feel dizzy every time I get up.
She looked up at the ceiling.
She left her children behind.
I didn't want to spend any more time alone.
That's enough for today.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
Thank you for waiting.
Why did Tom call you?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Can I see this?
It was only a dream.
I wasn't aware that Tom was unhappy here.
Which concert did you choose to attend?
In case of emergency, call the police.
Tom almost cried.
Why are you waiting here?
How could it be?
I lost my keys somewhere yesterday.
Let's just say no.
She tried to persuade him to attend the meeting.
I don't think I can walk any faster.
I can't change that.
How did you get into Harvard?
Try to go slower.

He dislikes me.

Do you have a cellphone?
Do you really love me?
I'm afraid it may rain tomorrow.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Would you like to go to the zoo this afternoon?
Can you show me how to do this?
I don't care who you're going with.
Did you do it?
My father's car is new.
I don't believe in luck.
I'll accept your offer.
I can't pinpoint the problem.
I just saw a shooting star.
You don't have to worry.
Take anything you want.
Were you going to the train station when I saw you?
I think you're probably right.
I'm sorry, I don't buy it.
Dogs are barking.
They saw him enter the room.
I heard what happened.
"I'll be back in a minute," he added.

Don't do that.
You have to do it by yourself.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
This is a matter of great importance.
What am I doing here?

I don't think I can keep that promise.
I just want to be normal.
Tom did exactly as I told him to do.
We rent movies all the time.
I would like a glass of water.
Tom is busy preparing for his trip.
You're all invited.

It makes no sense.
The surgeon who operated on Tom is very experienced and highly regarded.

I'm ready!

You've won!

I know what you could've done.
It's on its way.
Have you already eaten supper?
Can I try this on?

I need more information on this matter.
I hear with my ears.
If you eat so much, you'll get sick.
Don't ask me to explain it.
You'd be perfect for that.
He had his secretary type the report.
I want to be involved.
No one's working.
It's not a dog.
I can't wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this.
You're totally ignorant.
Can I talk to you privately?
I really want you to quit.
He made his way through the crowd.
I heard something.

Sometimes I say "yes," even though I want to say "no."
I have no idea how he escaped.
The bed is very comfortable.
She mistook me for my sister.
Would you say it once more?
I'm feeling confused.

Let's call Tom.

Are you busy today?
We're not prisoners.
You're clever.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
I won't accept that.
Now eat your supper.

It's my turn.
He never tells lies.
You are expecting too much of her.
The trip was canceled because of a terrible storm.
I figured you might change your mind.
Why did she need to send for him?
I can't blame you. It was my fault.

Why doesn't Tom help you?
They're not always right.
Tom was dying.
Tom attended Mary's funeral.
This book costs 3,000 yen.
Please don't make me eat that.
Hang on a second.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
It's nice to be a role model for others.
What does this have to do with our current problems?
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you accept his invitation?
Can you just tell me now, so I don't have to come back tomorrow?
The robber was nabbed this morning.
We're normal.
A man is responsible for his deeds.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand.
I don't think that's true.
I bought the same camera as you have.
Where did you get the money to buy that dress?
Tom drives a black car, doesn't he?
We're untalented.
That was a very sad story.
You don't seem to understand.
You could be a little nicer to your brother.
I caught them by surprise.
You will need a bodyguard.
She can swim.

Do you still want to give me a hug?
How long do I have to stay?
If you tell people what they want to hear, they'll do what you want.
Are you productive?
I'm looking forward to receiving your reply.
I'm going to build a fire.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
It was a mess in the department store.
What don't you want me to do?
We went to the beach.
I'm considering resigning.
Hurry up, or you will be late.
What were you doing, Dad?
That's quite simple.
I have heard quite a lot about you.
Did you drop it?
Let's put this money aside for our summer trip.
I'll study harder from now on.
Choose three books at random.
I can tell you're angry.
Don't tell anyone this.
This is a kind of watermelon.
The doctor is taking care of Tom.
The monkey came down.
I would like to go with you.
I want him to leave.
Would you like some help?
I asked for a seat in the non-smoking section.
I'm going to the bank.
How many have you killed?
I can't hear anything at all.
Is Japanese taught in your school now?
You're turning red.
Time passed very quickly.
She was very worried about her husband's health.
Sit here.
Will you go out tomorrow?
It was so cold that I couldn't sleep.
Don't push me!
It is a lot of fun to drive a car.
The pain was more than he could stand.
Don't make me go back there.
I want to learn to play the guitar like you.
Come back.
How can I pay?
I know a man who can help.
We know you're not stupid.
He stood up for what was right.
Tom has trouble sleeping.
It was an extraordinary year.
I like what you've written.
I don't have any close friends.
We're having some problem.
Every bride is beautiful on her wedding day.
I'm not an expert, so my answer to your question is just an educated guess.
He is something of an artist.
We'll respond.
Please heat the water.
Are you happy?
I think Tom's leg is broken.
I'm glad to hear of your success.
What do you plan on doing with the money?
I think she's 40 years old.
They'll find us.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I support you a hundred percent.
I didn't actually want to go to college.
She got into the car and drove off.
Choose one.
Despite all his setbacks, he remains an optimist.
Don't make me regret this.
Tom's grandfather and Mary's grandfather fought together in World War II.
Why did you side with him instead of me?
It's starting to snow.
She advised him not to smoke.
Shoes are sold in pairs.
There's so much I want to tell you.
Spit it out, Tom.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
They're jittery.
Twenty years is a long time.
It's undamaged.
I really don't want to talk about this.
Hold on a minute.
I can't allow you to do that.
You need to be careful.
He twirled his mustache.
Don't let them go to waste.
I feel bad for them.
Are you out of your mind?
That's the worst thing you can do!
You made a horrible mistake.
Such painters as Picasso are rare.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
We depend on each other.
I can lend you some money if you need some.
You're still my son.
I don't mind if you leave.
Tom still has the book I lent him.
Theory and practice should go hand in hand.
What are you drinking?
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
I'm happy to see you again.
I don't like feeling so powerless.
Tom's different.
It's a nice country to visit, but I wouldn't live there.
I think we're going to have a very strong team.
We were all worried.
The sooner we get there, the more likely are we to get seats.
I wasn't consulted.
More and more people offered to help.
I want to make sure you're going to be all right.
It's all so senseless.
Is it accessible?
Quit behaving like a kid.
Tom is not my friend anymore.
I saw many birds yesterday morning.
It was only a dream.
I hate being stupid.
I just want you to be happy.
I give up.
Why don't you just admit that you were wrong?
What I told you about him also holds good for his brother.
He got what he deserved.
I left my wallet at home on that particular day.
Let's go by bus.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
I'm a little bit jealous.
He is ashamed of his behavior.
It was all a big mistake.
I was unable to go outside.
I appreciate your support.
I want to meet the teacher.
A growing child requires more food.
I prefer walking to cycling.
It is not necessary for you to quit the job.
I always take a bath before going to bed.
I want to retire.
Tom is a doctor.
This bad weather is more than I bargained for.
It's your money.
Excuse me, does this train go to Washington Square?
I trust you.
I want to start now.
Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
He fits the description in the newspaper.
We must have faith in the president.
Of all the possible reasons, he chose the least expected one.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
She used to hate him.
I'll accompany you to the hospital.
How did you get into Harvard?
What is your ultimate goal in your life?
Who else is here?
What is love?
It's hard for an old man to change his way of living.
I am to take over my father's business.
When I was a college student, I always pulled all-nighters before tests.
You're talkative.
He is very afraid of dogs.
I'm home.
I'll drive to Detroit.
Do you remember what you were watching?
I'm not comfortable with this.
She has been waiting for him thirty minutes.
Tom thinks I'm an idiot.
You can't go out.
If you really don't want to come, you don't have to.
The joke's on you.
Tom is better than I was at his age.
No one speaks this language anymore.
Tom just can't seem to get along with Mary.
Tom is the main character.
I'm giving my old books away.
I'm not going to pass out.
It became useless.
She was advised by him to go abroad while she was still young.
I'll be with you in a second.
The judge handed down a sentence of five years hard labor.
It's very kind of you to help me with my homework.
Tom showed me what he meant.
Where did you go to college?
She had twins.
We don't have anything to eat.
How do you know who I am?
They told me I had to help you.
I quit after a week.
She was advised by him to get more exercise.
Did Tom fall?
Few people live to be 100 years old.
That's not even the worst part.
You're not staying here, are you?
We can't really keep all this stuff, can we?
Tom, do you still love me?
How much longer will the thunderstorm last?
Mary asked Tom to shave off his beard.
I'm not tired yet.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Why didn't the police notify us?
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
I can't tell you how many times I've been there.
I want to talk to you about this report.
He is a member in good standing.
I just can't help you this time.
I have something I want to tell you.
Is the weather nice?
I think you know that's not a good idea.
I did that which she asked me to do.
I'm sorry to hear that your father passed away.
Is that right?
This sentence is not French.
You're still green.
That's his.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
Would you like some tea?
It rains a lot in June in Japan.
Can you see what's wrong with this picture?
That girl is more cute than beautiful.
Women seem to like him for some reason.
I trusted my teacher.
She has broken the toaster again.
I think you might need some help.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
What do your children usually eat for breakfast?
I didn't think you were coming.
Tell me about it!
They let me go.
We must always do our best.
I go shopping every morning.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I can't stand getting beaten.
I told him to work hard or he would fail.
The two of us don't belong here.
She had the kindness to help me.
I'm not certain.
Tom says he was busy.
Thunderstorms are both scary and exciting.
Where are the other girls?
Are we done?
I think so, too.
You're a good liar.
I appreciate you coming here.
They're afraid of us.
He soon grows tired of a thing regardless of how much he liked it to begin with.
Can I ask you a question?
Be very careful.
My father gets up early.
She got him into trouble.
Do cats dream?
Are they cops?
Factories were producing more than ever before.
You shall have my answer tomorrow.
Looks are not everything.
Do you have enough?
Have you finished reading that book yet?
Why don't you start at the beginning?
He made for the door.
The world did not recognize him.
I should've gone there with you.
Stop yelling!
The coach urged his team not to be complacent following their four consecutive wins.
She has not finished her homework yet.
Can you spare some change?
He inherited the business from his father.
How much money did you spend on your car?
Do you speak Chinese?
Let's clean up this mess.
I want for you and me to be happy.
Keep driving.
I invited him over to my place.
Don't you think the dog is smart?
Tom sounded really upset.
Where do you get off telling me anything?
The petals floated on the surface of the water.
Two doctors were talking shop.
There's no need to hurry.
Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
You just have to ask for it.
What you said is not true.
Could you take our picture?
I'm breaking up with my girlfriend tonight.
London was bombed several times.
Digital music is becoming more and more popular.
There's nothing there.
You're all insane.
He secretly showed me her photo.
I don't like Tom so much.
Tom deserved the punishment he got.
I slept with my clothes on.
Do your homework now.
I bought her a new car.
This broken vase cannot be repaired.
I had my doubts about you.
You're not going, are you?
It took Rei 20 days to get over her injury.
You need to be more patient.
I didn't even know you spoke French.
Do you think you could be a cop?
You'd better not tell Tom.
Why would I tell anyone?
You didn't tell me everything.
Tom was scary.
This is bad news.
Someone came.
Tom kept singing.
I didn't know about that until quite recently.
I know what they're capable of.
She fell unconscious to the floor.
The feeling's mutual.
That's the reason why I couldn't attend the meeting.
They probably don't know.
He felt utterly humiliated.
I can feel it.
Are you saying no?
Do I know him?
I have good news for you.
Where have you been the last few days?
Are you ready to go out?
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
I always counted you as a friend.
I'm sorry that I can't be who you want me to be.
I believe I am in the right.
He should get to the office in an hour.
OK, I think I got it.
A storm is brewing.
That's a real load off my mind.
I was sitting next to a man who clearly had a lot on his mind.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
This has got to be a joke.
Don't litter!
I want you to do some research.
I am tired of reading.
Tom will make a good teacher.
It is on this point that our opinions differ.
I object to her going there alone.
How many people died?
He took off his hat.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
What do you seek?
I believe it.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Let's make a phone call.
You're going to have to stop doing that.
I'd like to go to college.
I have nothing better to do.
She goes to night school.
She advised him to stop smoking.
It was fun while it lasted.
Bring me today's paper.
Are you making friends here?
Stay back.
It looks very nice.
We talked about various topics.
You're not being fair.
I ate caviar.
I've got to get going.
I am interested in music.
Wake Tom up.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
I assume you're angry.
I am counting on you to give the opening address.
He took his wallet out of his pocket.
How come Mary is going on a picnic with him?
That dress matches her red hair.
You have no idea how much that means to me.
A true friend would've helped me.
Don't talk to anybody about this.
We did fine.
Have you heard from him recently?
It's a small problem.
I have nothing to do this afternoon.
He tried to restrain his anger.
What did you see?
We have no clue where he is.
I speak only the truth.
I'm afraid it's going to rain tomorrow.
I thought he was my brother.
Who else is going with us?
I know you have a girlfriend.
He writes to me less and less often these days.
Your dreams will come true.
I don't see the point.
That's a good thing to have.
Do you have a book written in English?
She picked up one of the glass vases.
I've got better things to do with my time.
I don't quite follow you.
That is where you are wrong.
I did that ages ago.
Tom helped Mary carry her suitcases.
He has three children.
Tom's important.
Repetition helps you remember something.
She caught me by the arm and stopped me from going home.
I wonder how long it's going to take.
She introduced me to her brother.
That's not important right now.
Are you proud of me?
We've seen him.
It took half an hour.
She gave him his first kiss.
I wanted to know what happened.
Not feeling well, I stayed home all day.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I have a cat.
Lake Biwa could be seen from where we were standing.
The weather will definitely be good tomorrow.
You were lying, weren't you?
It's so pretty.
Keep in mind what I tell you.
I'm still angry because of her.
She made her point.
It is pretty cold.
Subtlety never was your strong suit.
I love you.
I sat down next to him.
The spinning top skidded across the floor.
I went there yesterday.
Tom handed Mary a knife so she could peel the apples.
I maxed out my credit card.
I wrote him a letter asking him to come home soon.
Where is the hotel?
What do you say we go for a swim?
I do remember the incident quite well.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
We had a very busy day.
I see they've put you to work.
I no longer work here.
Does this bus go to the beach?
I gave the beggar all the money I had.
Why can't I play with my friends?
You never know for sure.
Hey, how do you get this thing open?
I am certain that you have noble thoughts.
I haven't read any of his letters.
The girl still believes in Santa Claus.
Two roundtrip tickets to Osaka, please.
I often played soccer when I was young.
If blaming me makes you feel better, go right ahead.
Don't stand near me.
I knew it was right.
She is knitting a sweater.
I don't have a car.
The baby cried all night.
He made up his mind to marry her.
I want to go abroad.
I have a favor to ask of you.
You're very brave.
Tom lost his friends.
You are the kind of guitarist I like to sing with.
I'm not happy with this.
My dream is to become a teacher.
That doctor specializes in helping those with eating disorders.
I can't excuse his laziness.
We had a secret meeting.
He is not kind to her.
Your father seems very nice.
I really am busy.
This book is full of errors.
I didn't notice the light turn red.
She brags about how well she can cook.
He is a hard worker.
I saw an exciting baseball game last Saturday.
Don't make me hurt you again.
You're more beautiful than I remember you.
I've never eaten Chinese food before.
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?
Grab a broom and help us clean.
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You'd better go home.
Why don't you drop her a line?
I must have misunderstood.
I think I've broken my arm.
I don't think he is sincere.
I have a cold.
No one told me.
Can you jump over a chair from a standing position?
They're brave.
Mother Teresa was born in Yugoslavia in 1910.
This is the hottest summer that we have had in thirty years.
I'm willing to apologize.
Mary isn't as pretty as her sister.
It was a great trip.
Where did you go last Sunday?
I went to your school.
The older we grow, the poorer our memory becomes.
Little by little, the bird made his nest.
Go and get me some wine.
I'm unconvinced.
I hope you're not offended.
The demonstration at City Hall started getting out of hand.
What did she whisper to you?
Please stop.
Your behavior was inexcusable.
It's true!
She advised him on that matter.
I should've gone with Tom.
What is it you do?
Nothing is more valuable than time, but nothing is less valued.
It's instinct.
You have a great imagination.
Let's not panic over this.
He is likely to be late for school.
I've just finished writing a letter.
Can you believe this is really happening?
You screwed up.
He is immediately above me in rank.
Tom has never met Mary.
I'm not worried about him.
I think we should look into it.
She gave it her personal attention.
This is what I want to do.
Nobody noticed her absence.
Tom won't tell you anything.
This is a company car.
I knew I was making mistakes.
Can you tell me what this is?
I don't want to fight you.
I had never eaten any kind of Thai food, so I was pretty excited about going to a Thai restaurant with my grandmother.
I am too tired to run.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
I don't have time to help you with your homework.
They live in constant fear.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
We should not impose our opinions on other people.
Is it this hot every day?
You should not have done that. It was wrong.
Take all the time you need.
I think you're not telling me something.
You can't handle this alone.
He's about to leave.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
He can't afford to get married.
They kept singing until a rescue team came.
I just listened and kept quiet.
Do you need money?
I was astonished by his ignorance.
He went on doing it.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
Are you falling in love with me?
Excuse me a minute.
I used to go to church on Sunday.
Smoking is forbidden here.
He usually went to bed at eleven.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Why don't you read it for yourself?
Mr. Jackson is my favorite teacher.
Is this appropriate?
They said you were fired.
Why are you so insecure?
The dog is dying.
I recognized her as soon as I saw her.
We eat to live, not live to eat.
How about eating out with me?
I can't count on Tom.
She answered in tears.
Nobody contributed to the understanding of dreams as much as Freud.
I was so humiliated.
Who are you to decide?
You'll have to ask Tom that.
He doesn't look his age.
Just a minute.
He kicked his shoes off without untying them first.
I can't ignore that.
That's not interesting.
It is none the less true.
Who do you think will come first?
He was accused of being a spy.
Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
I just got engaged.
How do you feel about the issue?
What do you feel like doing tonight?

I want to live in Tampa.
You are important.
He could not answer that question.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Who has eaten all the cookies?
I belong to the sailing club.
I lost that argument.
He ripped his shirt open.
Can you please stop that?
The problem resolved itself.
I don't want him to touch me.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
Tom made friends with Mary.
Whose notebook is that?
Tom certainly gets a nice sound out of that old bassoon.
The alarm sounded.
What're you all dressed up for?
I'm planning to stay at my uncle's place.
Tom is talking to Mary now.
The old man starved to death.
I'm not comfortable doing this.
I've got a cold.
Lie still.
I'm about to leave.
It's done.
This airport is easily accessible by bus.
It just doesn't count.
She couldn't convince him to ride a horse.
Days are getting longer.
What do you think now?
He was paroled after having served eleven years of his sentence.
It is not as good as it looks.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
I must get going.
My friend said he had bought a new watch.
Let's just get rid of Tom.
I just couldn't keep my eyes open.
His behavior is worthy of praise.
Please come again in three days time.
Tom is swimming in the pool.
I want you to take a look at this.
They found Tom in the crowd.
I had a fantastic time at your party.
The news spread all over Japan.
I never want to see you get sick.
My phone has a caller ID that lets me screen my calls.
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
I don't know whether he'll come by train or by car.
That's a lame excuse.
In those days, I made it a point to take a walk before breakfast.
It is not for beginners.
I did you a favor.
This is unacceptable.
Have you taken your medicine yet?
When did you come?
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
Do you remember how we met?
Show us around.
Show yourself.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
Tom was able to do what the rest of us weren't able to do.
I just want to tell Tom something.
We're not free.
What else would you advise?
He asked for a drink of water.
I really like my coworkers.
Where were you born?
He's your father.
I'm pretty sure that it won't snow today.
I received your note.
It's time for you to get up.
There are few books without misprints.
You don't have to come see me.
Contact my assistant if you have any questions.
I think something is wrong.
We have to bring our teaching methods up to date.

Do you often listen to audiobooks?
Better to die on our feet, than to live on our knees.
I need a hacksaw to finish this job.
Bring as many boxes as you can carry.
What are you interested in?

It's the same for everyone.
Hurry up, or you will miss the last train.
I've never broken the law.
Do you know where Tokyo Tower is?
I cannot do without this dictionary.
I don't know what else to try.
I don't think I can wait any longer.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
I am very tall.
Message me online.
She spent a lot of time writing her essay.
Is this building open to the public?
Do you have any kids?

That problem naturally invited discussion.
He left everything to chance.
Art is not a luxury, but a necessity.
We heard something moving in the next room.
They all went to the restaurant.
How many boys are there in the room?
I'm first.
Could you turn off the TV?
How would you analyze the situation?

Would you like to take part in this risky experiment?
You should go home now.
Get out of the way.
I will give you anything you want.
Tom was badly injured in a traffic accident.

We like Tom.
She was ready to help him with washing the car.
I like neither of the pictures.
I read a lot of novels.
Can you keep a secret?

He can swim.
Relationships involve compromise.

You can't say no.
I didn't realize you were serious.
Why are we running?
I finally gave up.
There's a day left.
He was sworn in as mayor.
I need to write that down.
How certain are you that he's a criminal?
His manners are not those of a gentleman.

Is it getting worse?
What a disaster!
You have to leave everything.
I just love to watch Tom play.
They have enough money.
You've got to be bold!
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
I'm quite sure of that.
The floor must be very clean.
I'll try my luck.
He arrived shortly after.
Everyone laughed.
We lay on the grass.
I've got to do something first.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
You must be careful not to make him angry.
Are you still sleepy?
We won the battle.
He was unimpressed.
I am afraid that you will get lost.
I don't have travel insurance.
As far as I know, he is a reliable person.

Be polite to your parents.
A problem shared is a problem halved.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
It's cold out there.
Where did he go?
Since I had a cold, I didn't go visit him.
I didn't think it was real.
Why don't you start?
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
We're not perfect.
Tom thanked everyone for waiting.
I'm not going to get involved.
She kept crying all night long.
Don't try to fool me.
Is Tom OK?
The slaughter of the prisoners was a barbarous act.
He's ahead in the race.
I'll walk you to the gate.
Both of them seem suspicious.
Can you swim?
What do you want to know?
He comes every day to visit his sick friend.
Clearly you're not interested.
They don't really care.
He lives next door to us.
Come in.
I'm still having the same dream about drowning.
Cows supply milk.
What do you say we go to my house?
It's kind of complicated.
Tom's arrived.
It's late, so turn off the TV.
He asked an awkward question.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
We could hear wolves howling in the distance.
He didn't specify when he would return.
Looking at his face, you could tell that he was annoyed.
Come back tomorrow.
Excuse me, do you have the time?
I saw him once.
I think we should sell our old car.
Why are people afraid of you?
Just don't break anything.

This novel is difficult to understand.
They're ignoring me.
No one disagreed.
I just want to thank you.
You go there without me.
"Just go in and tell the boss you want a raise." "That's easier said than done."
I want to warn you.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
What time did you wake up?
Which one will they choose?
You must look after the child.
Stop worrying.
It's quite clear to me that this is the truth.
I'll be back in my office.
Do you know what she said?
How can you concentrate?
Just give me some time. I'm sure I can figure out how to solve the problem.
Is something different?
I haven't seen you around before.
Try to control yourself.
We are under his command.
She is always free in the afternoon.
Sit wherever you like.
She began to like him right away.
She worships him.
I apologize for not replying right away.
That should be enough for you.
I love Monday!
I told you I'm not hungry.
I'm really busy.
He hoped to succeed.
I'm ruined.
I'm used to it.
What makes you think I don't like your friends?
Would you ever go out with a guy who couldn't sing?
Be polite, but firm.
We must be cautious.
I feel horrible.
It is difficult to get him to do anything on the spur of the moment.
She went with him to the movies.
It was a huge success.
Are you still afraid?
She put me in a delicate situation.
It's about time somebody did something about this broken door.
I'm meeting someone for dinner.
I can teach you how to do this.

You look fabulous.
I didn't tell him everything.
Bring me two pieces of chalk.
Tom is teaching me to paint.
I'm glad to hear that.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
I can't go.
Tom leaned on the counter.
He's a slowpoke.
I knew it wouldn't last.
Did he touch you?
Is this a riddle?
If I were in your place, I would not do so.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
I have not had a chance to see that movie.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
Some people are difficult to please.
I would rather walk than go by taxi.

The children were sliding on the ice.
I strongly advise you to take this medicine right away.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?

They're afraid of me.
This is nothing.
You did that on your own, didn't you?
This better not happen again.

I have a large family to provide for.
We can't pretend that this didn't happen.

You don't have to wait until the end.
Tom was wondering how he was supposed to get around without a car.
Fasten the rope to the tree.
Run as fast as you can.
How did you become involved in this project?
I do hope you understand.
I thought so at first.
I hurt myself today.
She told him to stop.
I have a computer.
Don't let me down like you did the other day.
It's one thing to make plans, but quite another to carry them out.
You're not as smart as me.
It's really infuriating.
I rescued you.
Everybody knows that.
You all did well.
It's stealing.
Leave us alone.

The furniture belongs to my mother.

Unbelievable!
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.
I'm on my way to visit a friend who's in the hospital.
It's not a bad thing.
Tom's reply surprised Mary.
I have a few English books.
I bet he will get mad.
I took the 10:30 train, which was ten minutes late.
Have they arrived yet?
She did pretty well.
Do you want to give it another try?
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
I can't speak German.
How can you say that?
She held him tightly and never wanted to let go.
It's all work-related.
I demanded that they be allowed to leave.
Stay in this room.
How foolish of you!
She had a blue dress on at the party yesterday.
In Japan, there is no lake bigger than Lake Biwa.

I'm careful not to spend too much.
I don't want to live my life like this.
This is risky and dangerous.
I like cats.
She smiled and said goodbye.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
That will buy us some time.

Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Don't drink any alcohol.
Tom was afraid to cross the road.
Did you think I was Canadian?
I don't like Christmas anymore.
Do you like to live in the country?

That's not love.
Go away before they see you here.

I wasn't too sure about it.
Do you feel like eating something?
Thanks a million.
Do you play tennis well?
Let us out.
She felt someone touch her back.
Take your shoes off before you come into the room.
I like challenges.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
Tom sealed the envelope.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
I can be assertive if necessary.
We'll never make it.
Why are you all so happy?
He was lucky.
She hates fish and never eats any.
They've had enough.
He said it as a joke.
I felt like I was intruding.
Please let me know when dinner's ready.
She assured him that everything was OK.
You're in the right place.
I am much obliged to you for your help.
Yeah, you could be right.
Do not interfere!
She is thirty-one.
Who are you talking with?
The bird was covered with white feathers.
She told me an interesting story.
You work too hard.
I can't take any more of this.
Look at that koala over there.
I thought they wouldn't like you.
Activist groups for the environment and food safety question the product’s safety.
I stayed.
Do you like salmon?
We should ask Tom.
We made a good team.
What did they expect?
I'm certainly not your friend.
Stop hiding your head in the sand.
Our teacher often overlooked his name on the list.
That should be enough for you.
I can't believe I actually said that.
Where can I wash my hands?
We've all seen it before.
Isn't that exciting?
What are you doing today?
Your dream will come true in the near future.
I read the entire book.
I'm about the same age as you.
You don't fit in here.
I'm sure that we'll all miss her.
I have nothing to say in this regard.
Do you remember what to do?
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
He left his hometown at the age of fifteen never to return.
She's smarter than me.
He was wounded in the head.
My parents made me go there.
Let's not waste any more of each other's time.
They saw him enter the room.
Did you bring the book?
I'd appreciate your help.
I can't go to the cops.
They did not go there.
Why did they do that?
I could use some sleep.
Kids are smarter than you think.
How beautiful this flower is!
She introduced her sister to him.
Did you hear the roar of the lions?
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
I would like chicken soup.
Hay is for horses.
No one else was injured.
You are good.
Let's have a serious talk about your future.
I write poems in my free time.
Our business is expanding.
We ate sandwiches for breakfast.
That work was done very quickly.
How long do dreams last?
He has many tenants on his land.
I was really upset.
It's a good way to make friends.
Ask your question.
Do as you like.
A stitch in time saves nine.
She's lost her car keys.
I don't care how old you are.
I hope that's not true.
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me.
They are a peace-loving people.
She told us the road was closed.
I assume that was Tom's idea.
Tom knows this is the truth.
She scolded him for being late.
He will be a good husband.
He lay on the bed.
Tom probably thought I was at school.
I hope you don't mind.
We have two television sets.
He spoke highly of you.
This does not bode well.
Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?
What's your favorite racing game?
You're the only person that can persuade him.
I have read three books since this morning.
She was watching the dead leaves falling.
Did you see Tom at school today?
That jacket is way too big for you.
Take a walk every day.
I love talking to you.
He was given the sack.
Did you think about it?
I wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression about me.
Tom continued to talk to Mary.
He went in place of me.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
Would you hand me that?
It's suicidal.
You need to stop.
I fell asleep listening to music.
When did you arrive in Boston?
I'm a Japanese teacher.
Everybody is sore.
Physics doesn't interest me at all.
Do you mind if I join you?
I want to buy a more expensive watch.
He has not come yet. Something may have happened to him.
There are no new messages in my inbox.
He studies hardest of all the students.
His essay was full of original ideas.
He laughed at me.
Did you lie to your parents?
This was built since long ago.
What is all this stuff?
Is his story true?
Can you prove that what you said is true?
It's been nice meeting you.
Tom began to brush his teeth.
Tom is rather optimistic.
It's not OK to smoke here.
He is the stingiest person I know.
We gave them food.
Some Asian men wear make up.
You can't cancel the meeting.
That's stupid.
Be more careful from now on.
That was totally my fault.
I wish I could see you.
We're unemployed.
This is a doghouse that I made myself.
We could live in peace here.
My mother gets up early in the morning.
I want you to treat me a little nicer from now on.
Did you kiss anybody?
You were late, weren't you?
They started dancing.
We're all agreed on that.
Tom isn't paying attention.
I know that plenty of guys want to go out with you.
Don't be naive.
You are hopeless.
We're not going there.
How does this concern you?
That's an interesting choice.
I'm getting married.
Tom tripled his investment in six months.
This is easy.
It was really considerate of you to lend me $500 when I was in difficulties.
You've always been so good to me.
I played an interesting game of chess against the computer last week.
Look at all these flowers.
The sun sets in the west.
Can you come?
What do I need to know?
I'm glad to see you're happy.
She wasn't able to talk to him.
I would like to insure this package.
At present, he is in Canada.
I can lend you some money if you like.
I'm going to miss you, too.
She was breathing hard.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
It is important for old people to stay strong.
Tom is a much better liar than you.
I didn't recognize what it was.
I'm homeschooled.
You are early.
You're very observant.
The machine is out of order.
I hope you'll both be happy together.
I won't cry.
I'm looking for a job.
Let me know when you will arrive at the airport.
Tom pretended that he didn't see it.
Please insert a coin.
I want to know who paid for this.
He succeeded in business.
Her name slipped my mind.
I make you nervous, don't I?
I'm an American citizen.
I let the cat out of the house.
The woman is ready.
You don't need to thank me. I'm here to serve you.
I was detained.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
You must turn in your old license in order to get a new one.
She demanded to see the manager.
This shot will help numb the pain.
I think that's the point.
Do you think I'm ugly?
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
We have to figure out a way to make some money.
Don't act like that.
I lay on my bed.
Anger showed on his face.
You're crafty.
I'll believe it when I see it.
Will we be in time for the concert?
I know as little as you do.
I hope you're not going to disappoint me.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
May I start eating now?
How long did you stay at the party?
Don't try too hard!
Tom can trust Mary.
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
Could I make a reservation?
What are you wearing tonight?
You can go back.
He will run for mayor.
I'll tell you about it when I get home.
I hid behind a tree.
I wasn't that smart in school.
I can't thank him enough.
I am not sure, but I think I want to be a teacher.
There's no other choice.
How old is your son?
Tom tried to open the car door.
He went to work in spite of his illness.
We both know Tom is innocent.
She tossed me grapes and I tried to catch them with my mouth.
But why is it all so secret?
Is this my wine?
Go away.
It's a personal matter.
You all right?
Do you fly frequently?
Would he like that?
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
It was hot, so I turned on the fan.
I had no idea you'd be here.
They go shopping.
I envy you.
I enjoyed it very much.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
I wonder what happens if I press this button.
I can't fix this.
Don't waste your breath.
I own this property.
It's a bit intimidating.
There are cases where honesty doesn't pay.
I didn't do anything.
Tom clearly doesn't want to be there.
Those are all important.
I wasn't listening to the radio.
I can't believe that you actually got into Harvard.
I thought Tom was going to be here.
Can you make it go any faster?
Don't spread yourself too thin.
Are you satisfied with your job?
They ate and drank wine.
My father will support me financially.
His aim is to become a doctor.
Get away from me.
Why don't you go help Tom?
I wonder if this really works.
He achieved his aim at last.
They live in a house.
Go with the flow.
It is absurd trying to persuade him.
Your house needs painting.
You must work together.
You can't back out.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
The conference will take place in Tokyo.
Do you know what Tom was wearing?
That reminds me of home.
I've already found somebody to do that job.
They built a snowman together.
Make it quick.
It is hard to distinguish you from your brother.
Why don't you get a job?
I hate to be a nuisance.
Tom expected to leave early in the morning, but he overslept.
When was she born?
Don't tell me what's possible.
I really wanted to go.
Come down from the tree.
I wish I could.
He didn't want to sell the book.
What would you take for the lot?
When did you get back from Boston?
Search the house.
She quickly opened the letter.
You have to learn how to compromise.
Don't you want to know?
Would you care for some more cake?
The product of two negative numbers is positive.
We're not watching.
I want you to follow orders.
He leaned over her and said, "No, I'm not lying."
He was among those chosen.
He is drinking tea.
If you would talk less and listen more, you might learn something.
I'll do whatever it takes to get you back.
Tom wants to come to Boston with us.
I asked Tom for advice.
She gave him some food.
The person reading a book on the bench under the tree is Tom.
You're on the path of success.
The quickest means of travel is by plane.
What do you do in your free time?
I don't know why you don't like him.
I'm starving.
It took a long time for her to write the report.
They said it's OK.
I will have finished reading this novel by the time you come tomorrow.
I'm not a fool.
He is as great a poet as ever lived.
Where does this piece go?
I thought you were taller.
Something must be wrong with the camera.
I've never cared about such things.
I am going down the stairs.
Tom disguised himself as a fireman.
Don't forget to write to us.
Where is the cathedral located?
My best friend is in Rome now.
Fold up your bedding.
I'm happy enough.
Please tell me what's going on here.
Tom blew all his money on a motorcycle.
It was no problem.
Tom loves his children, of course.
I think you haven't understood the question.
I thought I'd lost you.
You are a bit fat.
She came home in low spirits.
I need to be at work by 7:30.
Tom hasn't read the morning paper yet.
Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
I'm not quite ready yet.
No one knows the cause.
See things as they are.
Don't leave them alone.
The girl was carrying several books, not textbooks but thick hardback books.
Two tickets to San Diego, please.
She is habitually late.
I love Christmas.
These chairs are different.
I'm pleased with his performance.
I wonder if you are truly happy.
You really must see that movie.
You can have someone do it for you.
She lied about her age.
The rain is wonderful.
Have you ever broken a bone?
Were you disrespectful?
You look happy today.
Tom has solved that problem.
Lock your door.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I really like garlic.
I don't think I'd like you as a friend.
He was the last person I expected to see.
People from Madrid are weird.
They want us to come in right away.
You said that you hated Tom.
Where do you usually go fishing?
Tom said he was afraid.
That's not what I think.
The sailors abandoned the burning ship.
Do you disagree?
It's not possible to live on that island.
I want to stay here a couple more days.
I don't want him to touch me.
I know that you're a teacher.
Since he was able to walk so far, he must have strong legs.
I think this is yours.
Show me the way to the bus stop.
Shut the door tight.
I can't say that didn't hurt.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
Don't leave.
It was entirely by chance that I found out what he was doing.
They dragged their boat onto the beach.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
I won't stay here alone.
She's the teacher's pet.
Earth is a beautiful planet.
It's obvious that he's not used to living on a tight budget.
Why does everyone think I'm stupid?
You're obnoxious.
She said nothing that would make him angry.
I don't know whether I'll be able to attend tomorrow's meeting.
I'm not afraid of anyone.
It was summer and the weather was warm.
We kept our word.
He is a learned man.
On weekends, I take my dogs out for a long walk in the park.
I knew we'd find you.
He is in excellent physical condition.
That's a trivial error.
Don't respond to questions marked with an X.
I'm seriously considering moving to Boston.
He can't have told a lie.
Start running.
Your courtesy is appreciated.
I'd like you to look after my dog.
Don't wait for me for dinner.
Are you satisfied with the political situation in your country?
I don't have the address with me.
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.
If you want to participate, you have to register.
He stood up.
I've got to do this.
I've had enough of your snide remarks.
It's incredibly easy to cheat the system.
Who called you?
I think it's time for me to mow the lawn.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
We're shocked.
The violence lasted for two weeks.
I love your garden.
Where did you have your suit made?
I do love you.
He began to work to get Congress to reduce taxes.
"May I use this telephone?" "Go ahead."
I don't have a suit.
The letter was written by Tom.
The arrow hit the target.
We're wealthy.
I just want a normal life.
He knows a lot about animals.
I thought you'd be happy.
I'm dehydrated.
Don't shout.
The children went out to play.
It's easy to lose your footing on loose gravel.
Tom is in the ski lodge.
He is my boss.
I want to hear from you.
I'm fussy.
The pyramids were built in ancient times.
It's all in your head.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
I'll let you off this time, but I don't ever want to catch you stealing again.
You've got to be kidding!
What did you decide?
My pen isn't as good as yours.
Let me go.
Tom doesn't smile often.
Don't fire anyone.
He behaved like he was afraid.
Tom is ill at ease among strangers.
Be a good girl.
Let's get together tonight.
A high proportion of crime in any country is perpetrated by young males in their teens and twenties.
He doesn't have the ticket.
The doctor pronounced him dead.
I thought you liked it here.
I was bitten by a lot of insects in the forest.
I like playing golf.
Should I go or would you like me to stay?
I bet it will rain tomorrow.
Why don't you trust me?
They've all moved away.
The little boy accidentally broke the glass.
We got there at the same time.
I didn't see anybody following us.
You can't complain.
Don't gloat.
He tends to talk too much.
They want to participate in the Olympic Games.
I admire your work ethic.
She is good at making up interesting stories.
I had everything under control.
You look very tired.
We're not strangers.
It was a stupid idea.
I don't know who that man is.
I think you know what you should do.
If there's anything urgent, you can get in touch with me.
She bought him a car.
Something is grating on her nerves.
She left her ticket at home.
Now shake hands and make up.
I need a hammer.
Fill the bottle with water.
All of us are happy.
We were concerned.
I want you to get off my back.
Where is the school?
Did you have fun tonight?
He tried solving the problem.
Don't leave me behind!
He seems to know all about her past.
Do you think English is difficult?
I realize that there's a problem.
I like your shoes.
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
Aren't you feeling well?
She really likes writing poems.
Please correct the errors.
I fully intend to return.
Are you looking for me?
Tom is trying to say something.
I like being alone.
We ran around the park.
I want to trust you.
I don't like leaving the job half done.
I need to talk with you.
Don't you think I know my own father?
Your wife left.
If it happens to rain tomorrow I'll stay at home.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
I feel much better today.
He felt the same way as I did.
You should return what you borrow.
The pain has gone.
I'll work.
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
I'm willing to apologize.
Your shoes are here.
Good afternoon. You are our new neighbor, if I'm not mistaken?
I found it necessary to get assistance.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
I must insist.
Let Tom answer.
Get out of my life!
Do you really want to do this?
You lost, didn't you?
He shouldn't have done that.
Yesterday my bicycle was stolen while I was doing some shopping.
That made me cry.
Children need love, especially when they don't deserve it.
I don't like snow.
She will be here this evening.
I can't do that either.
I've taken care of everything.
She has a large room all to herself.
You're spoiling the mood.
I think I'd like to be a teacher.
What a beautiful town!
Can you stay for dinner?
What's the matter?
I do appreciate that.
I went by bus as far as London.
I'm going to save more money.
He saw everything.
Is this what you were looking for?
Would you mind paying this time?
The electricity went out, but it's back on now.
I advise you to change clothes.
I usually get up at six.
Tom's reaction was the opposite of what Mary had expected.
I'm not a genius.
Let's go downtown.
We seized the town after a short battle.
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
Come a bit closer.
As for me, I have nothing against the plan.
We met on a blind date.
Many people are suffering from hunger around the world.
I'll never leave you alone again.
We weren't able to determine her whereabouts.
She sold all of her furniture, so she could afford to feed herself and her dog.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
They're waiting for you.
Don't kid yourself. You couldn't afford to buy a house like this.
You are twice as strong as I am.
Was the movie interesting?
We need to band together to beat the enemy.
Could you download a file for me?
The questions came fast and furious from the large number of reporters who had gathered outside the courthouse.
What Tom said was a lie.
I got lucky.
Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
The train has not arrived yet.
Take me to your place.
I am thinking of my vacation.
You probably already know about our company.
I don't need it.
What do you have in mind?
You are not Japanese.
Do you want to play tennis with us?
I guess that will have to do.
I don't know what came over me.
Tell me I'm not dreaming.
You should have accepted his advice.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
What do you mean by it?
You had better go now.
He won't talk to her and she won't talk to him.
I only hope you're not too late.
There is no advantage in doing that.
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
There was nothing but sand as far as the eye could see.
Run for it!
Where did you stay?
We ran down the hill.
You may go at once.
He doesn't seem to be heading for the town.
This is how I learned English.
I'll do it, if you insist.
The book is mine.
How many hours a day does Tom swim?
It often rains here.
I can't afford to rent a house like this in Tokyo.
He is such a show off.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
He speaks English well.
We have to clear the snow off the roof.
We made it.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
Light the candles.
I don't like the ocean.
Please sign this receipt.
He is not altogether wrong.
My brother bought an electric guitar.
He went out a little before five o'clock.
How did Tom get that information?
Do you have enough time?
I have two brothers.
Never speak ill of others.
January is usually the coldest month.
I'm always happy.
Is there something you want to say?
She removed the dishes from the table.
You don't need to hurry. Take your time.
He's an advocate of barefoot running.
In doing anything, you must do your best.
I do not think that he will come.
My baggage is missing.
Have you measured it?
Can somebody help me?
You're all the same.
It's as cold as ice.
The city was blanketed with snow.
Did you steal that car?
I don't have a system.
Tom can't help Mary.
Real men drink tea.
He is off today.
It's really cool here.
That sounds reasonable.
Industrialization often goes hand in hand with pollution.
What does that word mean?
I cannot help wondering if he will come on time.
What am I supposed to do with that?
I like fresh air.
Take any two cards you like.
I'm sorry.
Someone is coming.
Do you feel lucky?
I often refer to the dictionary.
You smell wonderful.
Don't forget your things.
I'd like to visit Australia.
I forgot to tell you my phone number.
The Nozomi is the fastest of all the trains in Japan.
That's the computer on which he writes his articles.
This fluid can be substituted for glue.
I hugged her tightly.
How much did the tickets cost?
Who invited Tom to the party?
Your friends are late.
I use this desk.
At last, it began to rain.
Won't you have some tea?
Have you ever eaten turkey?
Tom mistook me for my older brother.
She told me she loved me.
Please put it back in its place.
There's so much I want to tell you.
You have been busy.
We have seen three wars.
I'd like you to meet my sister.
How can you not remember?
Tom mistakenly ate his entree with his salad fork.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
Stop talking loudly.
The airplane was flying above the clouds.
Tell me if you don't think this is funny.
No problem.
I'm surprised they didn't have anything to do.
The clock has stopped.
This is amazing.
That's hers.
I need someone to hold me and tell me everything will be alright.
Please keep in touch.
Tom doesn't take vacations.
I'll remain your ally no matter what happens.
I got what you wanted.
We have till tomorrow night to decide.
If possible, I'd like to know the name of the author.
Tom thinks this price is reasonable.
You're just a coward.
Could you please stop saying that?
I suggested that we bring the meeting to an end.
Give me your keys.
Whereabouts did you say this happened?
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
She didn't know what to do.
They began a discussion.
I want to ask you something.
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
He lost his movie ticket.
You look pale.
Do you come here often?
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
This is a pencil.
On the tenth of next month, they will have been married for twenty years.
I heard someone calling me from a distance.
Have you been listening to me?
Leave the book where it was.
Pour a little wine in my glass.
Is she Japanese?
I gather you were hurt.
Tom talked about Boston.
New York is a huge city.
They want you dead.
Seen from the plane, the island looks very beautiful.
He asked me where she lived.
Don't ramble.
I'm dead tired.
Let's go tell the others.
The two men sitting on the bench were Americans.
Did I surprise you?
Do you have any money?
Pardon me, what's the name of this place?
Tom is sad, isn't he?
Why did you keep it a secret?
You've gone too far.
I hate to be a nuisance.
Tom concealed his anger from Mary.
He tried to soothe the angry man.
I'm in a better mood now.
He wants you to come home.
Try to be generous and forgive.
You can trust them.
He weighs 70 kilos.
A forest fire broke out in this area.
Turn left at the second traffic light.
You should get your eyes examined.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his keys.
Maybe you'll succeed.
He has been waiting here some time.
How else can he act?
Everything is so expensive.
I'd rather stay home than go fishing.
We don't have a dishwasher.
Did you have fun last night?
Is that your sister?
Are you waiting for someone?
I really couldn't have done this without you.
You look a little green around the gills.
A winter sport that many people enjoy is ice skating.
I must find some new friends.
I'm going to take my car.
I'm too busy.
He traveled by boat.
This book's new.
Come on, get up.
I moved back with my parents.
He went far away.
It doesn't surprise me.
I'm not ugly.
A fuse has blown.
I'll go out there and look around.
Tom just wants to spend a little more time with Mary.
Why did Tom lie?
Nobody's forcing you to stay.
Don't be late for school.
We saved your life.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I really am interested.
Study these sentences.
You go on without me.
A new kind of bullet had been invented.
The soldiers began returning home.

I'll apologize.
She parted from her friend in tears.
Pickpockets target tourists.
Tom comes here nearly every day.
Did she look in her bag?
You're right, of course.
He isn't afraid of death.
You're still alive.
Is my answer correct?
The fire was extinguished at once.
Were you looking at him?
I'm well.
I still don't feel safe.
Do you want to join me for lunch?
You're required to help them.
He is a teacher.
Was that all you saw?
I hope something bad doesn't happen to us.
I'll lend you my textbook if you promise not to write anything in it.
He is no ordinary student.
Stop reading comic books while working.
The well ran dry.
Water the flowers before you have breakfast.
Crime is down.
Close your eyes and tell me what you hear.

You talk too much.
How did you get hurt?
Do you know what it's called?
There's nothing surprising about that.
They know the truth.
You're very kind, Tom.
You will regret this.
Do you know the man who's staring at you?
Have a nice time.
Was there something you wanted to tell me?
A temporary government was established.
Tom refused to talk to me.
Don't drink the water.
Would you mind shutting the door?
I just wanted to say that I love you.
An apple fell to the ground.
I'd rather die.
He scarcely ever watches TV.
You can go there.
I hope you're happy, too.
I admit I was surprised.
We talked quite frankly.
The car isn't worth repairing.
Tom paid for it all.
He's not as old as my brother.
I don't see anything special.
It's just a formality.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
Have you heard from the rest of the team?
I plan to stay here until my money gives out.
Science is fun.
She looked more beautiful than ever.
Are you all alone?
I lost my way in New York.

Where are you from?
You're a very attractive woman.
I was discredited.
I'm waiting for a train.
You don't have to get up early.
How did you spend your winter vacation?
I could see that.
He crawled out of bed.
I want to teach you something.
The more you study, the more you know.
You were hurt, weren't you?
He is like a father to me.
Tom is teaching French to Mary.
It's good enough.
Tom is a friend of mine.
She cannot play the piano.
You've been busy, haven't you?
I feel like taking a rest.
I rang the bell.
You look a lot like your brother.
Tom was wearing his pajamas when he opened the door.
Hopefully, the weather will be good.
I can give you something for your pain.
I think it's time for me to ask for his advice.
We're all after the same thing.
My sister can't start the day without reading her horoscope.
You don't have to get up so early.
I asked Tom to drive me home.
You didn't eat much lunch, did you?
We lost our electricity because of the storm.
It is often necessary to depend upon others.
Try not to be so tense.
Let me finish.
She wants me to go with her.
My Internet connection isn't fast enough.
I feel funny today.
You should meet him.
I don't feel much like laughing.
Someone is watching you.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
Save yourself.
Tom asked me to come back tomorrow.
Do I smell bacon?
He cut off a slice of meat.
This bird can't fly.
I never claimed that I could speak French.
The official dinner took place at the White House.
Frankly speaking, I don't like you.

I want to see it.
I'm just as confused as you are.
I wanted to tell you.
Will you sell your house to him?
We can't stay here. The roof is about to collapse!
My mobile has been stolen.
May I borrow your phone?
He lost all of his money.
Why did they hire you?
There is no shame in being poor.
Where have you been up to now?
You may come in now.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
How is that possible?
Close all the windows.
You don't have to go.
You'd better sit here.
I had other things on my mind.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
We did it!
How are you today?
Do you have any in blue?
Having failed several times, he tried to do it again.
Would you like to have a look?
He's such a cold fish.
Christmas is approaching.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Would you like to talk about what just happened?
She herself gave him something to eat.
I just couldn't go through with it.
A wise man would not act in that way.
I have just arrived here.
I know what your name is.
There's nothing to be scared of.
The house gets painted every five years.
The rain didn't stop them from doing their job.

I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
I want to hear who won.
What a huge dog!
I can't do this alone.

I appreciate the effort.
I don't know about that.
Why did you choose that particular subject?
If you wish, you can go.
There is an urgent need for improved living conditions.
I owe what I am today to education.
I think you should open an account here.
I would like a little wine.

He hired some new workers.
I sincerely hope not.
You are overworked.

She is very wise.
I just don't want to lose you.
I pleaded not guilty.
The concert was a success.
Are you still scared?
I really do want to devote some more time to studying French.
She lived to be ninety.
I don't feel like going out these days.
I never thought about it that way.
Who's in charge of this matter?
You're talkative.
My father doesn't lift a finger at home.
Is she gone?
How do we stop it?
Industry as we know it today didn't exist in those days.
Ignore Tom.

Let him in.
Give me a second.

She met her uncle.
I was happy for him.
It's your decision.
If you don't miss the train, you'll get there in time.
He stuck his pencil behind his ear.
Aren't you embarrassed?
We thought his threat was only a joke.
It's not for everybody.
Did you talk to your wife?
You said you needed someone to protect you.
We're alone.
Sea levels around the world are rising.
I appreciate your trying to protect me.
May I offer you my chair?
I know you have a girlfriend.
You were both drunk.
She speaks loudly.
I'll send you home in my car.
I'm very shy.
I have some money with me.
I think I'll take a look around.
I figured something was up.
I think it's time for me to make some new friends.
You still haven't told me how old you are.
The thief ran away when she saw the policeman.
I never imagined we'd be talking about this topic today.

I didn't see you until now.
He turned his attention to the picture.
She invited me to her home.
I want you to help me clean it up.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
You'd better give up smoking.
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
It isn't too late for you.

Do you want to ask me some questions?
Have you ever gone to Venice?
I was there last night.

You're very understanding.

He isn't any older than I thought.
Can I count on you?
He studies computational linguistics.
I wanted to talk about it.
Do it again!
He began skinning the animal.
She suggested that I give it to him right away.
Don't touch that button!
I'm pretty sure that's Tom's goal.
