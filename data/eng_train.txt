I can prove that I am right.
She is now staying at her uncle's house.
I love talking to you.
The enemy launched an attack on us.
I got thirsty.
I must be going now.
I can't promise anything.
There is no hurry.
If Tom were here, he'd know what to do.
Forget it.
What kind of information are you looking for?
He lives in his car.
I was sure of it.
A good appetite is a good sauce.
Does that make you angry?
When did you say that?
I'll have what he's having.
He retires next spring.
One of the apples fell to the ground.
It's possible that Tom is a genius.
We're up a creek without a paddle.
Don't tell Tom you're a cop.
You should've told me yesterday.
I understood.
I can't be without you.
I don't believe in fate.
I can't eat that much food by myself.
The police told me not to leave town.
I paid the bill.
Don't step on the broken glass.
I was afraid that I might hurt his feelings.
Is that so bad?
I can't do without an air conditioner in the summer.
I want an MP3 player!
You are a workaholic.
I had a good time during the trip.
Christmas is December 25th.
Be attentive.
What are you preparing?
You don't look comfortable.
Who said I had a gun?
He's about the same age as you are.
How do I know that you're not going to do that again?
They shouted for help.
Why don't we drop by to see her?
Half the office took a day off.
Is there any life on Mars?
There is little hope that they are alive.
You can't control me.
I was drugged.
Having done his work, he went out.
I swear I won't tell anyone.
Why do you think I'm here?
I couldn't care less.
Don't look down on others.
What are you going to have?
I'm hit!
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
I don't want to go alone.
Let me go.
I've got to talk to you about something.
I enjoyed talking with my girlfriend.
Tom gave away everything he owned.
Have a nice holiday.
I hope this data is wrong.
Tom thinks he's a genius, but I don't agree with him.
I got caught.
What is it you want me to do?
She can't do that.
She wrote to me to come at once.
It would be nice to have a party.
How's your new job?
He's going to love this.
It's very unlikely.
Can you think of any better way to do this?
I cannot bear the pain any more.
He denied having said such a thing.
I was probably thirty years old at that time.
He reached out for the sugar that was on the other table.
He did the work in two days.
I was the only woman.
If only I had known the answer yesterday!
He's photogenic.
You're new around here, aren't you?
I can't breathe.
They met on a blind date.
You weren't there, were you?
I saw what your dog did.
Whether Shakespeare wrote this poem or not will probably remain a mystery.
Our school is near the station.
Don't trust people who praise you in your presence.
It was so cold that he was shivering.
I make you nervous, don't I?
He asked me what was the matter with me.
How's your new job?
I don't know how to reach you.
You seemed to like that.
You're productive.
About how many books do you have?
There must be some misunderstanding.
Isn't there something you want to say to Tom?
Who were you talking to?
Where do we get the textbooks?
Do you think they're coming after us?
Tom is a dancing teacher.
He was tired from his long walk.
Don't try anything funny.
You need to hit the gym.
Tom's not a nice guy.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I'll be out of town for a few days.
Do you want me to make coffee?
I love hanging out with you.
I fixed it.
I don't get the meaning of all of this.
We do very good business.
I knew you'd know where to find Tom.
I would never let you down.
Do you actually live here?
Be careful when you cross a road.
She is collecting material for a book.
Would you like a single room?
I got fined.
It can be frustrating.
Did you hug anybody?
I always walk to school.
My parents aren't home right now.
That man stole my purse.
Tom didn't give me back my money.
Please leave.
Don't touch the stove.
They're lying.
You should have been more careful.
I will explain the situation to you later on.
I really enjoyed myself.
I leave for Paris tomorrow.
It did not come off.
Who did you go with?
We'd like a double room with bath.
I should've known it was you.
Tom has something to tell you.
I'm doing it in spite of you.
He drank beer.
If it were not for his idleness, he would be a nice fellow.
She was always practicing the piano.
You're smarter than me.
Show me another watch.
I've done this before.
Let's have a contest. The side to come up with the worst insult wins.
Do you want a job?
I first met him three years ago.
Think of your brother.
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
I apologized for having been late for school.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
She tends to underestimate her own ability.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
What's your date of birth?
Tom wanted to spend some time in the country.
We caught you.
Do you not like girls?
Run for it!
How many fish can you keep in your tank?
I reacted instinctively.
Would you like a drink?
There is a map on the wall.
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it.
I don't remember that guy's name.
She pressured him to quit his job.
Your problem is you're not patient enough.
Where did you go for spring break?
I'm sick of you.
His careless driving caused the accident.
I know I'm not dreaming.
You're weird.
I think it's time for me to get a new job.
It is hard for me to believe this.
I wish nothing but the best for you.
Tom forgot to feed the dog.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
I prefer that it stay that way.
I know you are clever.
There were no consequences.
I'm not comfortable with this.
You have a big nose.
I can spot a bleached blonde from a mile away.
Can you think of anyone more suitable?
Maybe we should come back later.
You're the tallest person here.
Everybody likes you.
Do you deny it?
They are typical young people.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom tells you.
He gets really testy when he doesn't get his way.
That scenario is unlikely.
I'll show you how to catch fish.
Tom is violent and dangerous.
You will soon come to like this town.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
What would you do if you had a million dollars?
I shouldn't have drunk so much beer last night.
None of the rooms is ready.
Why didn't you just take the money?
He raised his hand to stop a taxi.
It is imperative for you to act at once.
Tom always walks to school when it isn't raining.
They worked through the night.
It's unusual for you to do something like that.
I just got there as fast as I could.
She hated him so much.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
No one arrived.
Maybe Tom has had an accident.
Are you happy with your new sports car?
I just want to say good luck.
Tom shouldn't have told me.
What's Tom drinking?
I support you whole-heartedly.
Please reconsider.
I'm not hungry anyway.
Your dog is very fat.
I'm a fan of German opera.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Tom wants to become a priest.
I have to be honest. I was a little bit nervous the first time I had an MRI scan.
You're not one of them, are you?
Can you stay for a while?
I would appreciate a reply.
I'm not sure of the exact date.
Write a poem with four three-line stanzas.
I'm still sleepy.
I was outdoors.
He introduced me to his relatives at the reception.
I wasn't even there.
Do you like my new haircut?
I was surprised to see so many people at the concert.
I finally found time to sit down and read the newspaper.
The Normans' conquest of England had a great effect on the English language.
You must do the work, even if you do not like it.
The door was locked from within.
I'm assuming you have a plan.
I know you're in love with me.
I'm not your husband anymore.
The family had a hard time after the war.
I have a bad headache today.
I've dealt with this store for years.
He eats a lot.
They don't let anyone enter without special permission.
He is over the hill, you know.
That's news to me.
Are you Chinese?
I want to check something.
I don't hate you.
Compare your translation with the one on the blackboard.
Let's face it, it's impossible. We're never gonna make it.
The sirens went off.
She has about 2,000 books.
I'm calling to report a lost wallet.
She almost always arrives late.
We should've tried harder.
Our team is winning.
Let's be clear on this.
She complained about my low salary.
You should have a doctor look at that.
I'm not home.
I found the subject fascinating.
We need to go.
Please be careful.
What do you think?
The issue is not settled.
We are entering a new phase in the war.
Are you happy with that?
That's all I can offer you.
I ruined everything.
Tell Tom that I'm exhausted.
I could never harm you.
He kept on telling lies.
Were you conscientious?
I wouldn't like to work in a hospital.
Poverty drove him to steal.
They can't fire you.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
I enjoy playing the blues.
It's a common mistake.
I think there's no point in trying to convince him.
The street is full of cars.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
She wants a fourth generation iPad.
We'll see each other again someday.
You need to be more aggressive.
The word is no longer in use.
They failed both times.
They kept him waiting outside for a long time.
We're quite alone.
Did you do it?
Don't gloat.
The pressure is getting to him.
You don't seem convinced.
We were born on the same day.
You had better make use of the opportunity.
I want you to die.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Tom put his pistol under the pillow.
It sounds like a good plan.
How many of you are going?
Can this be just between you and me?
Whatever you say.
How often do you feed the fish?
He heard the news on the radio.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
There's no need for her to go there herself.
I can't drink any more.
I don't understand opera.
It smells bad.
I'd help you if I could.
We have to warn them.
Has prison changed him?
Tom is checking his messages on his phone.
A policeman came up to me.
I always have a good supply of tissues in my pockets.
Is anyone on board?
You should try to live within your means.
He doesn't work here now, but he used to work here.
We were at a loss what to do.
He is beginning to lose his hair.
What did they hit you with?
She is saving money to go abroad.
Can you come?
See above.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Tips are not accepted.
I want to look different.
Tom knows a lot of proverbs.
I thought I'd lost you.
You've turned up at the right moment.
The hunter hunted rabbits with his dog.
You're really selfish.
It so happened that I had no money with me.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
I think you're funny.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Tom has back problems.
When did you arrive in Boston?
They collected shells on the beach.
They formed a circle.
We're quite alone.
I'll save you.
He ran toward me as fast as he could.
Could you please pull the weeds and water the flowers?
We can't be killed.
Are you happy?
I had no idea you could speak French.
In the fall, many birds head for the south.
You're a terrible person.
Those aren't mine.
What's he doing there?
Stop that!
I don't like cops.
You're so sweet.
I thought you'd want to know.
Tom has quite a quirky personality.
Which of the composers do you like best?
He inserted the key in the lock.
She plays the violin well.
He was determined to finish the work at any cost.
A man is more or less what he looks like.
I'm glad that you'll come.
That's the one thing I'm sure of.
We like to learn foreign languages.
A foreign language cannot be mastered in a year or so.
The new bridge will have been completed by March.
Don't be mean.
Be merciful.
He doesn't seem to be aware of the problems.
The workers came to ask about their pay raises.
Do you have anything to read?
They kidnapped me.
This one's all yours.
He showed off his new car.
It took me two hours to get to Yokohama.
He's a newcomer.
It is starting to look pretty cool.
I need to get something.
That took guts.
Say which you would like.
I can show you the pictures.
The two poems express human suffering.
I want that more than I've ever wanted anything in my life.
At what time does your class end?

What is that?
Tom is much older than he looks.

The celebrations culminated in a spectacular fireworks display.
I have a favor to ask.
The soccer game will be played, even if it rains.
He never fails to write to his mother every month.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
Worrying never does you any good.
I suppose you are right.
We stopped for lunch at a local restaurant.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
He gave in.
What he said was a slight exaggeration.
You've given me good advice.
I hard-boiled an egg.
I'm rather proud of it.
I expected you to be here for lunch.
I can't tell you the answer to that yet.
Tom can ski as well as his brother.
I can't really remember.
I don't understand why it happened.
You're very stylish.
I may have hurt his feelings.
It is said the house is haunted.
I always got up early in my childhood.
He is rich, but his older brother is poor.
Is that what you think I want to hear?
They said it's OK.
Life without books is unimaginable.
She returned his kiss.
What's your shoe size?
Tom makes me feel young.
He didn't get paid for it.
I don't know anything about his past.
What choice do we have?
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
He has lots of new ideas.
I don't know how to make you happy.
Why did you kill the snake?
I'll tell Tom you were here.
We were on the same train by chance.
I dreamed about Tom last night.
I can't believe you actually did something like that.
I'm assuming this is your father.
I should've gone home.
I suppose you have the right to know.
How can I get rid of him?
He attempted suicide.
Could you give me a lift to the train station?
We need to prepare for the worst.
Did you already do that?
I'm tired of dancing.
What've you been doing today?
Don't ask any questions.
I know that it is highly unlikely that anyone would be willing to help me.
How about wearing contact lenses?
Tom hates sports.
If you are ever in Japan, come and see me.
Why are we still talking about this?
I can't imagine what life would be like without you.
What does this note mean?
I felt myself lifted up.
What does Tom need?
We saved you a seat right here.
I appreciate your situation.
Today's your lucky day.
Don't take it so personally.
I'm not interested in a relationship.
Why don't we go check it out?
I don't allow it.
Do you need our help?
Are you saying I smell bad?
She saw a tall man yesterday.
Give it to me, please.
I explained the rule to him.

Why don't you return to your quarters?
Don't burst my bubble.
Is it really so terrible?

Be polite, but firm.
This movie makes no sense.
We all make mistakes.
My family is a large one.
You don't have to explain.
Be prepared.
I tried to make the best of it.
You're no fun.
The house went cheap.
How old were you when you started studying French?
We never work on Sunday.
I'd hate to be in your shoes.
What else can go wrong?

Degas was born more than 150 years ago.
Tell me what really happened.
Our dog will bite strangers.
It's such a beautiful flower.
I just didn't believe it.
Do you study English?

Who was there that night?
They'll grow.
Can I speak to the person in charge?
You're the same age as my son.
It was really close.
We are good friends.
She was advised by him to give up drinking.
It's the sort of work that calls for a high level of concentration.

Delete his name from the list of the applicants.
Don't come so early next time.
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
Where were the police?
I did this myself.
She whispered something to him.
No one is expendable.
That's what we all want.

There's still a lot to learn.
Take a bus.

What's wrong with your phone?
How long do I have to wait for delivery?
Let's talk outside.
He is going to drive you to the airport.
I can't depend on you anymore.
Please give me another chance.
I'm not very good at French.
I am in your debt.
You'd better not wait here.
Where is your money?
I've never heard that sound before.
I have some idea of what happened.
Is my answer correct?
I can't move my legs.
I don't think anyone really expected you to help.
I've been feeling this way all day.
Is there somebody you want to see?
You don't have to apologize.
This seems risky.
It's out of stock, but I can give you a rain check.
Would you step aside?
You're very clever.
I could get you fired, you know.
What did you do to get grounded?
Who is your favorite composer?
How are you all doing?
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
You seem very busy.
She tried a third time.
I've got to do my chores.
It will not happen again.
I figured you might want this.
Have a nice trip.
I felt as if I were in a dream.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
It was quite dark when I got home.
Do you know who took the call?
Leave this to me.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
I just wanted to listen to some music.
You're disgusting.
What reason did he give for being so late?
Tom turned off the air conditioner.
Get down!
The team needs me.
I'm very serious.
I'm often only half awake.
I did it without consulting anyone.
He is too old.
My brother insisted on going there alone.
I wish I could play guitar.
He's on his way.

Tell me what really happened.
Tom might be a traitor.

I'm lucky.
She devoted herself to him.

I just cut my finger.
It is ten o'clock by my watch.
I've got a cold.
I saw nobody around.
Let's take the 4:10 train.
Does it matter to you?
I was a bit emotional.
We ought to be ready for whatever comes.
I feel as if I were dreaming.
Don't feed the animals.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
I saw it with my own eyes.
He's not a liar.
Take a look.
I suggest we eat just a little now, and then go out later.
That's brilliant!
You can't do both at the same time.
He threatened to make it public.
Send in something to eat or I'll kill a hostage.
Are you going to visit any other countries?

Do you want to stay here all night?
I think my leg is broken.
Thank you for your efforts.
I hope we don't have to wait for too long.
Tom fixed everything.
I hope that it'll work.
Tom is out of danger.
You're funny.
Upon seeing what was happening, we decided to leave.
The plural of ox is oxen.
I feel like an outsider.
He was scared you would shoot him.
Tell me a true story.
Yesterday was very cold so I wore a hat.
I'm good at skiing.
What am I going to wear?
Wait till six.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
I'm really surprised you got a prize.
I can be there in ten minutes.
If I've misjudged you, I'm terribly sorry.
You were perfect.
We're not gonna make it.
I think Tom may be sick.
I felt guilty about it.
You want this?
I don't live here anymore.
I walked alone.
Tom is the fastest runner on our team.
You just don't know how it feels.
I was happy to help you.
Would you like to take a walk with me?
I feel protected.
She gave him the brush off.
I'd like to talk to Tom myself.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
They died one after another.
I'm lying on the grass.
Can you recommend a good play?
This is bad.
I had two cups of coffee.
Mary was looking for you at that time.
She is now better off than when she was young.
My shoelaces came undone.
You're the only person who ever comes to visit me.
I just don't want you to have it.
I'm glad you're here.
Tom just showed up at work.
Speak more slowly, please.
The bell is ringing.
He is employed in a bank.
Few passengers survived the catastrophe.
The army forced him to resign.
She has no more than 100 dollars.
The rain lasted three days.
A woman asked me for directions.
Learning a foreign language is difficult.
The reason is simple.
He started washing his car.
I told you his name was Tom, didn't I?
Tom already has our respect.
He's not my type.
I am glad to help you.
Are you envious?
I come here as often as I can.
The paper didn't carry the story.
I was entirely ignorant of the matter.
It's not stupid.
Seven is sometimes considered a lucky number.
I don't speak English.
It's a shortcut.
The wind is blowing from the east.
I hear you were grounded.
He asked me whether anybody was there.
What he's doing is illegal.
It's the sort of day when you'd like to stay in bed.
I thought you'd be older.
It didn't hurt at all.
You're not thinking clearly.
She died before coming of age.
What hurts the most is that you didn't feel you could tell me the truth.
You know I don't dance.
There were flowers all around.
Try to make it last a little longer.
Can this car go any faster?
It rained hard all day today.
I think it's somewhere around here.
The reporter criticized the politician.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm perfectly happy.
You didn't have to wake me up.
Will you give me some time?
I have two cats.
Nowadays nobody believes in ghosts.
It's very likely to rain tomorrow.
Come back later.
He appears to be strong and healthy.
Come home before it gets dark.
We both fell asleep.
She's five years younger than I am.
That painting has started to grow on me.
The suspect was innocent of the crime.
I can speak English a little.
Let me see your health insurance certificate.
I don't have as much experience as you.
I knew this would happen.
There's no food left.
I thought a lot about what Tom said.
I'm at your mercy.
I was disappointed in her.
He was looking through a microscope.
There's a book here.
I want ice cream for dessert.
I'm terrible at chess.
I just got your message.
I wonder when they'll come out with a cell phone in a wrist watch.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
The ghost vanished suddenly.
The man driving the bus is a good friend of mine.
As far as I remember, he didn't say that.
Tom went back into his office.
Can you explain it to me?
Where did everybody go?
The thieves divvied up the stolen loot among themselves.
My brother speaks very fast.
Are you productive?
You don't seem too sure.
There is a rock in my shoe.
I knew there was something fishy about that guy.
You'll soon get used to eating Japanese food.
Paper burns quickly.
I think you must be getting tired.
We're all done.
Are you sure you want to put your life in her hands?
I'm aware of the facts.
You're full of surprises.
Tom's wife is Canadian.
Going out in this rain is out of the question.
She was laughed at by her friends.
He worked through the night.
We must conform to the rules.
See you in the morning.
You shouldn't read such useless books.
She had a daughter by her first husband.
If I'd known it, I'd have told you.
She is not only intelligent but beautiful.
Please accept this little gift.
The people rejected the constitution.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Please close the door behind you.
That's terrible.
Why didn't you come to ask me earlier?
I was eventually released.
Are you still interested?
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
That isn't complex.
Tom is looking for his glasses.
He hung up.
That's all I had to say.
The book was so gripping, I could hardly put it down.
It looks very nice.
Don't make me do it.
Try not to spend so much time complaining about things you can't change.
I had to do this today.
I'm a little drunk.
Take hold of the rope.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I saw her spike his drink.
Would you like some cookies?
Had you been drinking?
He got his dander up.
I told her not to be late.
I should like to go for a swim.
I feel refreshed.
Any child can answer that.
She scolded him.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
I want to show you something very special.
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
Mary took her necklace off.
I think you'd better go.
May I have your name and telephone number, please?
We're too busy.
I was late for the meeting because of a traffic jam.
An electric guitar doesn't sound the same as an acoustic one.
I'm strong enough.
Two sheep were killed by a wolf.
Don't give up on your dreams.
You are stupid.
We happened to take the same train.
I really love her older sister a lot.
I think you can handle it.
Get ready.
Please stop singing that song.
It's all gone.
You were my friend.
The game is not over.
How did we get into so much trouble?
Do you know the way?
I asked him his name.
What is your first name?
This one has a lot of advantages over that one.
She sat next to him.
I have no insurance.
I won't bore you with the details.
I drive everywhere.
He left without so much as saying goodbye.
Are you a natural blonde?
The tall guy smoking a cigar over there is a famous director.
I think you shouldn't be doing that.
They released the prisoner.
Don't attack me.
I don't want to be rich.
There's no turning back now.
I know what they're doing.
I have something important to tell you.
You should not waste your time.
Let's make it brief.
Do you own research.
Do not interfere!
He stayed in bed because he wasn't feeling well.
You'll have to answer for your behavior.
She lost her father when she was three years old.
Quite by chance, I met my old friend in the airport.
You look like a little girl in that dress.
I haven't seen any of his films.
He is watching TV.
Everyone's fine.
Jump as high as you can.
It's true that she's dead.
Nothing is new under the sun.
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.
She tempted him.
Are you hiring?
Are you up to the task?
I go to any party I am invited to.
She pushed him off the pier.
I have a few friends here.
It has suddenly gotten cold, hasn't it?
This will be a game changer.
I feel empowered.
Please close the door behind you.
You don't seem very sure.
I guess that she is 40.
The museum is closed on Mondays.
I just want to put it all behind us.
Can you use a computer?
My boss made me work overtime.
Were you born there?
Sewage often pollutes the ocean.
I know you feel lonely.
He stopped the car.
We all want answers.
When was your first love?
He is inclined to get mad.
Go on without me.
Did you have fun tonight?
I'm afraid we can't rule out the possibility that she may have the disease.
How's Tom going to find Mary?
I had to keep my secret.
I knew this was a bad idea.
I'm busy, too.
I don't want to be your enemy.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
You're worried, aren't you?
That shirt doesn't go with the pants.
What do you say to taking a walk in the park?
I have been working since six this morning.
I designed it.
I can't stand this heat.
She was able to be ready early this morning, because she finished packing last night.
It wasn't at all funny.
You are responsible for what you do.
He held on firmly to the branch.
My hobby is collecting coins.
Tom wondered whether it would be hard to find a job in Boston.
Watch how I do it.
I grow tomatoes.
Do you want to go for a walk later?
I regret missing the chance to meet her.
If you need help, just ask.
He was the first man to cross the Pacific.
The fireman chopped his way through the door.
I suddenly feel very much alone.
That would embarrass Tom.
I don't think this is funny.
Leaving something unfinished is the worst thing you can do.
Can't you help us?
You're not bad.
That one's all yours.
Can I get either of you a drink?
Don't you all agree?
Try to stop me.
Repetition does not transform a lie into a truth.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
Ask him the way to station.
The photographs are the only proof we have.
Shall I check the oil?
He discussed the problem with his son.
I like your personality.
Tom has a healthy life style.
He decided to marry her.
How fast can you do it?
Tom is too old for me.
I want us to be friends again.
I'll come and get you.
My mother gets up earlier than I do.
He acknowledged his fault.
All's fair in love and war.
He walked at a quick pace.
He was hard to please.
You are the very man I want to see.
Have you eaten yet?
You really don't have a clue, do you?
I have a high fever.
Our house is yours.
They can't hurt you.
I had to wait for Tom to finish.
When did you find out the truth?
When we started out, we realized that if we didn't have a good product, we wouldn't succeed.
Tom could make you laugh.
I just want to be a little happier.
Nobody's ever heard of him.
Her belief in God is very firm.
Tom was Mary's boyfriend before she met John.
You won't be shot.
He stayed at his aunt's house.
It was only a dream.
I think it's time for me to reconsider how I've been living.
It's no use for him to try to find out the real reason.
How exactly am I supposed to do that?
I want you to get started right away.
I can't do it either.
The baby started to cry.
That would be a good idea.
The curse was broken.
I was given a nice watch by my uncle.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
The cheering ceased.
Buildings are much stronger now than they used to be.
This is not my idea of fun.
He longed for his mother.
Tom is a doctor.
I never expected to find such a nice hotel in a place like this.
Don't talk nonsense.
This was on the list.
I went to school.
Wait here till he comes back.
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
I want to know who told you that.
I knew something Tom didn't know.
Numbers that can be expressed as fractions of two whole numbers are called rational numbers.
The cat ruined my sofa.
We'll stay here.
Tom has a heavy German accent.
You're preaching to the choir.
I'd love to get rid of this old car.
There is a cat in the kitchen.
I love your eyes.
The tower can be seen from here.
The dog will not harm you.
I don't have any close friends.
I believe you like your job.
I can't say.
She despises people who lie.
Mary dyed her hair blue.
I could see that.
That is simply not true.
I will give it to you.
I'm studying very hard.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Is today your birthday?
It has been two months since my arrival in Tokyo.
I want a piece of pie.
A good night's sleep will do you a world of good.
I know what they're going to do.
Are you sure about that?
I'm correct.
I don't have enough RAM.
Tom told me he used to be rich.
He knows other and easier ways of getting what he desires.
How many people are in your crew?
Tom went home at 6:30.
You lack imagination.
We have no further details at this time.
I don't like being interrogated.
He intended to marry her.
They grow flowers in the garden.
I am exhausted.
I very much don't want to have to do that.
You can't help now. It's too late.
Whose friend are you?
This is suspicious.
Slavery has been abolished in most parts of the world.
Are you talking shop?
Where is it? I've been searching for hours.
I got lucky.
Tom was the only one who laughed.
Some people are reading some magazines on the train.
They were worried about getting caught.
Swimming in the sea is great fun.
Did I miss the turn?
You dropped your pencil.
Are you free this weekend?
I want you to give each other a hug.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Don't be late for the train.
She cut the apple in half.
We are moving next month.
I leave the matter to your judgement.
Let's not be fooled again.
I think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.
You're a funny guy.
Let's take a tea break.
I don't think your plan will work.
I like French food very much.
You're very brave.
I left one of my books at school.
There was only one left.
We'll explain.
They all talked.
Do you want me to be happy?
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
Nobody answered the door.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
Neither is correct.
Are you in favor of this motion?
Do we have a deal here?
Sometimes I wonder whether or not I made the right decision.
You ought not to make fun of them.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
If you had followed my advice, you wouldn't be in such a fix now.
How many books does he have?
Tom is arrogant, isn't he?
I can't do what Tom does.
Tom's nose was red.
I have been silent for a long time.
Who do you think she lives with?
I think it'd be better if Tom didn't tell Mary about this.
I was more than a little shocked by this.
That's not going to stop me.
Not all men are like that.
Are you questioning my judgment?
We've got enough space here.
My uncle has made me what I am today.
He is fluent in English.
When do we leave?
This is simply not true.
What year were you born?
Don't tell anybody.
She went on a picnic.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
That's why we want you.
Tom needs me.
I can't believe he kissed you.
She likes to cook for her family.
I love that scarf.
What did you do this summer?
I'm glad we saw Tom.
Don't commit yourself.
Bill Gates is the world's richest man.
What're we waiting for?
I don't want to be late for work.
You must respect your elders.
Put that back on the table.
You have to be home by nine o'clock.
I let my friend copy my homework.
Tom is the star of the show.
Who all knows about this?
My brother's room is always a mess.
You look disappointed.
Leave it to us.
I'm in charge of shopping.
Who do you trust?
I can see it in your eyes.
I'll go now.
He never speaks of the accident.
I don't like to be disturbed.
Who did you go with?
Dinner is ready, Father.
Nobody cares what you think.
I know that it is highly unlikely that we'll be able to sell all this stuff.
I could keep it a secret.
Are you for or against my plan?
A clear conscience is the best pillow.
I guess it won't matter.
My father has bought a new car.
Help!
That blow on the head knocked him out cold.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
Where do you park?
You should have accepted his advice.
Can you eat raw oysters?
He filled up the hole in the wall.
You scared the living day lights out of me!
He blamed me for the accident.
Every season is different.
After reading his books I feel I can construct a house.
She was in a hurry.
Don't look at us.
The well is dry.
I sometimes hear rumors about her.
How will I pay my debts?
Will I have the pleasure of seeing you again?
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
Tom will be delighted to see you.
I can't go with you.
I went to the park yesterday.
We're doing this for the money.
He had an accident at work.
No one is amused.
We must take into account the fact that she is old.
I had doubts.
He touched me.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
This is the house where he was born.
We would move to a bigger house if we had more money.
I was shaken.
This answer may not necessarily be wrong.
I'm sorry that I can't be who you want me to be.
That's what I've always said.
This house is large enough for your family to live in.
Everyone admired his courage.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
The terrorists released the hostages.
Get ready for bed.
Could I borrow your eyeliner?
I need to write that down.
I'd like to see that ring, please.
He only thinks about himself.
Let Tom decide.
This room gets sunshine.
Tom may not wait any longer.
Who am I forgetting?
Tom likes to listen to music while he's doing his homework.
I have been wanting to ask you a question.
The shower doesn't work.
This territory is uncharted.
I guess that's how I'd do it.
I bookmarked this website.
Don't forget about us!
Would someone shut him up?
People can't do a lot of things at the same time.
Why did you name your dog Cookie?
A fire broke out in the neighborhood yesterday.
He is unrealistic.
I want a kitchen like this.
Where is the police station?
I really don't feel good.
He quickly scanned the page for the word he was looking for.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
I'd like to brush my teeth.
How could you be so cruel?
She made me cookies.
I'm done with all that.
My sister works at the United States Embassy in London.
Mary is Tom's younger sister.
Tom is at school, isn't he?
It sure scared me.
I met an old friend by chance.
If you want to be free, destroy your television set.
Don't try to stop me.
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
I woke up with a headache.
She can speak English very well.
Tom will be here any minute now.
You've been following me, haven't you?
Corporations are competing to fill the vacuum.
Someday your dream will come true.
Please put your baggage on this scale.
All you have to do is study harder.
He's bulked up quite a bit since he's been going to the gym.
You don't look Japanese.
I am often in difficulties.
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
I've seen that.
You don't have to explain anything.
Get out!
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
Let's be honest with each other.
I advise you to change clothes.
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
Tom suddenly stopped talking.
Tom doesn't love his wife.
I think Tom is cheating.
Did she mention the results of the exam?
That would be unprofessional.
I'm pleased with my new jacket.
They kidnapped me, drugged me, and then brainwashed me.
I love to see you laugh.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
Tom really loves his country.
I addressed the envelope containing the invitation.
He has great confidence in himself.
I thought we could get together later.
I'd never let that happen.
I need to go into town.
They are exhausted.
I know I made a mistake.
An eagle is flying in the sky.
I'd like to offer you a job.
We're just children.
Whatever you do, don't push that button.
Will you try to play the trumpet?
I'll kick your butt!
Take it easy.
Can I have something to drink?
Who are you there with?
Go back to bed.
Stop it, please.
It was handcrafted.
How did you obtain this painting?
I feel like I let the team down.
Farmers defaulting on loans had to auction off their land.
You seem upset.
Why don't you give me a break?
Keep out of sight.
I just want to be loved.
I don't know what you want me to say.
I rushed out of my house.
The Sahara is the largest desert in the world.
She always keeps her word.
Do you have a match?
She advised him to go home early.
May I ask your name?
It makes sense.
I think Tom didn't understand what you were saying.
The more you play, the better you'll get.
Go and buy three bottles of coke.
His child's life is in danger.
That's a heartwarming scene.
Tom is drunk as a skunk.
He didn't carry out his promise.
I have complete faith in my doctor.
It was truly depressing.
Where's your school?
He doesn't look himself this morning.
I think Tom did that.
I've never seen a whale that big.
Don't be disgusting.
I have no friends.
I wrote the wrong address on the envelope.
I'm not going, and that's that.
Does this cap belong to you?
I skipped English class this afternoon.
I'll call you at seven.
I was discouraged.
I was tired so I went to bed.
I didn't see a doctor last year.
It felt good.
I completely forgot it.
I like to dress this way.
Tom is too tired to do anything.
We all want to go home.
It doesn't matter which side you're on.
She wants to dance.
You should do that right now.
Why did you let me sleep so late?
Tom says he doesn't have any regrets.
Their car overtook ours.
You remind me of your brother.
I want to thank everyone.
You're the best man for the job.
Many fish died.
Would you be friends with me?
Birds are flying above the trees.
You aren't a spy, are you?
I must make up for the loss.
You taught me that.
Can't we keep this between us?
His opinion was not accepted.
Where were you yesterday?
Is this made in Switzerland?
Are you busy?
Take out the trash.
We must not break our promise.
Caesar leaves Gaul, crosses the Rubicon, and enters Italy.
Do it this way.
Thanks to your stupidity, we lost the game.
Did you learn to swim when you were a child?
I don't really want you mad at me.
It's the truth.
He is sometimes absent from school.
Instead of eating vegetables, he puts them in a blender and drinks them.
She had a good time talking with him.
I think Tom did this.
They're out of their minds.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Here are some letters for you.
I was saved as if by a miracle.
Put the book back where it was.
I did you a favor.
Does that seem fair to you?
They're coming.
I listened to some CDs last night.
All share the blame.
I wanted to go.
How did you come by all this money?
Let me stop you right there. We don't want to hear about that.
I prefer to go by bicycle.
Anybody can solve that problem.
Tell Tom that I don't want to talk to him.
I wish I had had a camera then.
Tom only had a few visitors when he was in the hospital.
All of them went there.
Have you ever been to Boston?
Which dictionary did you refer to?
Don't expect too much of him.
How much is that going to cost me?
May I see your invitation please?
Do you like it then?
Where are your manners?
He is a big eater.
He's saving up to go to college.
He reminds me of his father when he speaks.
This clock isn't working.
I'm in the tennis club.
Every time I see you, I think of your mother.
It's not the end of the world.
I want to work.
She loves watching tennis matches on TV.
Don't make me hurt you.
You have to allow for the boy's age.
Going to this school requires a lot of money.
I am 18 years old.
It's in my jacket pocket.
They're not a threat.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
I want a blanket.
Please understand my position.
Movie making is an exciting job.
May I be of further service?
He looked at me for an explanation.
I made the best of my small room.
Tom handed an envelope to Mary.
Why are you interested?
I just wanted to write songs.
It's on the sofa.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
I can't help admiring his talent.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Is everything satisfactory?
Everybody's safe.
What time is it by your clock?
This is all so complicated.
We're kidding.
I have to meet him.
I owe you my life.
Please remain seated until the bus comes to a complete stop.
You're arrogant.
Reading books will make you smarter.
I'll fix a drink.
I no longer love you.
How about playing chess tonight?
Would you please keep the noise down?
He is eager to go there.
I hate that book.
Tom has dyed his hair black.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
We are students.
I'm sure Tom would be delighted.
Tom is extremely narrow-minded.
He understands physics.
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
What you need is a friend.
I don't care about your past.
Can you take this call for me?
Would you like to visit the White House someday?
After several delays, the plane finally left.
A light lunch will be served.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
Most accidents happen in the neighborhood.
I am all ears.
He's coming.
Your bicycle is better than mine.
Smoking is a disgusting habit.
It's a fine day.
Do you know what this is all about?
She is not a nurse, but a doctor.
Are you telling me you've never studied French?
Tom decided to go home early.
Talk to me.
Many students bought the book.
It's going to be close.
I'm here every night.
It's yours.
He left for no reason whatsoever.
What makes you think I'm not happy?
Do you have jeans in my size?
Why did you do it?
I'm sorry, but I didn't know it was a secret.
How about playing chess tonight?
Many Japanese get married in church.
I think both of them are right.
I am an artist.
Nothing's going to happen.
You don't have to go.
This young couple is in love.
I remember all that.
Watch the rear.
I know your son.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
Just tell me what you want.
No other mountain in the world is so high as Mt. Everest.
He lost his eyesight in that accident.
He always leaves the window open while he sleeps.
He served in the House for twelve years.
Japan has enjoyed prosperity since the war.
You should not go there.
He has no right to do this.
All three of us are students.
I hope you have insurance.
I'm really happy.
I just can't wait.
An old friend of mine visited yesterday.
He was happy being a Jew.
You seem to really be enjoying yourself.
We have no choice but to carry on.
I read the article about you in yesterday's newspaper.
This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.
How many idioms have we studied so far?
Tom loves watching Mary dance.
This girl changed her look.
Whose bed is that?
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
Please come pick up your package at the reception.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
Do you know the man staring at you?
I have nothing to do with their troubles.
The stream flows into the pond.
That's the last thing I want to do.
The dog felt guilty about eating the homework.
I question your choices.
I'll look after your child while you are away.
We have a simple solution for all this.
They handled it well.
This park is a paradise for children.
I wish my dream would come true.
I don't believe this is really happening.
I'm doing the best I can.
You can always text Tom.
Tom put on a pair of latex gloves.
At last, we got to the lake.
Tom asked me to go with him.
Do I need to be at the meeting on Monday?
Do I have to pay you?
You don't seem tired at all.
My mother can't come.
I was tired of watching TV.
You must be kidding!
You don't seem tired at all.
I'm exhausted.
How does this work?
Who's watching?
I wonder what the future has in store for us.
I want a book to read.
The company abandoned that project.
Can you believe what he said?
That key doesn't fit the lock.
These animals are friendly.
He kept pace with her.
We spent our holiday exploring rural France.
I think we've seen enough.
I suspect you're right.
If I were you, I would follow his advice.
I didn't go to the funeral.
I don't know this game.
Is it true that you are going to study in London?
Don't worry about me.
I'm sorry for what I said. I was out of line.
That sounds outrageous.
I don't have time for boys.
These shoes are too small.
All three of us are students.
She thinks highly of him.
I got sick of the constant noise of the street traffic.
She's smartly dressed.
The door creaked.
Keep away from the fire.
All the children started crying.
Aren't you dressed yet?
That's not my name.
If you can't come, please let me know ahead of time.
Reading improves the mind.
I love you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
I can't believe we're really living here.
Be creative.
If you were a spy trying to pass as a native speaker and said it that way, you'd likely get caught.
I know them all.
You might be right.
The removal of the load-bearing beam compromised the structure of the building.
Is distilled water drinkable?
These are just guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
Look at the cloud over there.
I've had a scratchy throat since this morning. I wonder if I've caught a cold.
Come over.
Tom forgot to bring his lunch today.
Please let me try it again.
I came yesterday.
Someone will do this job.
The suitcase contained nothing but dirty clothes.
Excuse me, can I have a word with you?
I had no idea.
I should've taken an umbrella with me.
How many words should you write?
He turned pale at the news.
They clung together for warmth.
I picked these flowers myself.
I'm too old to go to Germany.
Take one of these.
Tom knows that I don't like him.
What do you think happens then?
I suppose that's all right.
I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.
I don't know what to do or what to say.
She did her best to rescue him.
She fell down and hurt her knee.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
I concentrated my attention on the lecture.
Could you change these for me, please?
You sound tired.
She is certainly over forty.
Which book do you need?
You'd like Tom.
She has never gone on a date with him.
I'm serious.
There's nothing as precious as love.
You must not enter the room.
Developing political awareness takes time.
It's still dark.
You need to stop.
Hold this.
Is there something we can do?
I wasn't planning on doing that.
She made a bet with him.
Let bygones be bygones.
They're looking for a scapegoat.
Look what I made for Tom.
Don't you want everything to be perfect?
We're trapped!
I ordered two hamburgers.
There are some apples in that box.
I apologize for my rudeness.
He never speaks to me.
Tom is exactly three weeks old.
I found it difficult to please her.
I like your car.
Where do you all come from?
We both fell asleep.
When my wife finds out, she won't be happy.
He confessed his guilt.
I wish that Tom was here to help us.
Would you like to try it again?
Do you think he will like my gift?
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
I feel great and I feel healthy.
Justice will be served, whether here or in the hereafter.
Do not turn off your computer.
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit.
Are you happy?
I won't do that unless you want me to.
Don't touch me, you pig!
This is the end of my story.
Mary has beautiful brown eyes.
Don't judge a person by his appearance.
Wisdom comes with age.
We don't want to cause any trouble.
I made a complete fool of myself.
If you could go back in time, what would you change?
Nobody knows his name.
He drank detergent by accident.
The two politicians met face to face for the first time.
I am better than you.
I'm still kind of hungry.
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
I feel wonderful.
I have been to the airport to see him off.
We can all dream.
Are you hurt anywhere?
Don't do something stupid.
It couldn't have happened at a worse time.
In my opinion, she is correct.
Health is above wealth.
Don't open the door for anybody.
I thought I'd always be alone.
Everyone's saying it.
He's skilled at videogames.
She's been living for the last five years under an assumed name.
When spring comes, they dig up the fields and plant seeds.
They all cheered.
It wasn't much of a plan.
Don't you remember what you said?
Do you want to ask me some questions?
You can't blame me.
This table is heavy.
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy.
Hurry up, guys.
It was a very long meeting.
He drank straight from the bottle.
They water the fruit trees.
You had better not tell your father about the accident.
I don't care about my reputation.
There were survivors.
I want you to consider this.
They were enjoying themselves.
It is impossible for me to do the work in a week.
Tom will drive you to the airport.
I'm experiencing some heartburn.
You're productive.
It is very kind of you to come and see me.
Come join us.
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
What's going on here?
He had a loving family.
Has Flight 123 been delayed?
I'll go check.
How can you be so callous?
Nobody wants to work outdoors on a cold day.
I always counted you as a friend.
Some people think that advertising is a form of brainwashing.
The students made her life happy.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
I'd better see what's going on.
I don't suppose there's much chance of that happening.
Are you speaking metaphorically?
I know a lot of people don't agree with me.
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
Who did this to you?
I'm drunk.
She's lost her car key.
You need to find your own way.
Tom is a perfectionist.
There's no cure.
The milk is in the fridge.
I really need to take a shower.
It might not be enough.
I didn't know how to do it, but I was willing to give it a try.
You're going to be very proud of me.
You should not go alone.
Be prepared.
She's innocent.
The joke's on you.
You were there, weren't you?
What should I do in the meantime?
Dinosaurs became extinct a very long time ago.
I have to keep my mind on this important question.
I should've worn a hat.
Can you stay?
I can't imagine my life without you.
That's too long.
She is interested in learning new ideas.
Did you love Tom?
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Tom lives in the apartment above us.
I need some good advice.
That couldn't be helped.
He was too stunned to talk.
My older sister is good at typing.
Not every country belongs to the U.N.
I don't know where he comes from.
Show him how to do this.
How did you get into my house?
The palace was heavily guarded.
It's all behind you now.
Get out of here before I call the cops.
You're the one who trained me.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
She can run a full marathon.
He was stoned.
She panicked when she heard the news.
I'd like to know a little bit more about you.
You're not alone.
The new film was a great success.
Should I tell him?
He was lying on the couch.
I'm smarter than you.
I hope it does not rain tomorrow.
I can't tell you the answer to that yet.
Stock prices fell sharply.
Are these your children?
I'll give them an answer tomorrow.
We are all eager to see the movie.
You'll sleep better tonight.
Something's on your mind, isn't it?
That's how it started.
English is a very important language in today's world.
The prophecy came true.
I gave my old coat to Tom.
His company didn't survive the crisis.
It's our only show.
How are you feeling tonight?
I do not love him any longer.
He could not walk any further.
I was just trying to be helpful.
It doesn't matter which side you're on.
He has spent three years writing this novel.
This might be the last time we ever see each other.
The earthworm wriggled when I touched it.
Let's give it a try.
He's my younger brother.
Have confidence in yourself.
Monday is my busiest day.
Should we be worried?
Nobody likes being laughed at.
I've been looking for my keys all day.
We hardly ever see you around here anymore.
Don't interfere.
My life is such a mess.
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner.
Tom was surprised how well Mary could play the saxophone.
There are signs of growing tensions between the two countries.
What's Tom afraid of?
I'll stay here.
He's very flexible.
You're very curious.
We're not convinced yet.
Judging from his expression, he is in a bad mood.
Tom is no angel.
I know you feel lonely.
I wish I were as rich as Tom is.
Give it to whoever wants it.
He had led the Republican Party with great success.
I'm really hungry.
He got his doctorate.
His neighbors are suspicious of him.
I've never seen you laugh.
I think it's time for me to buy a decent camera.
Yesterday he came back late.
Please come in.
This time I will try it.
Do you want to leave it like that?
He didn't want to talk about it further.
He deserved it.
Don't waste my time asking stupid questions.
I could eat this for every meal.
She wasn't polite to him.
I like walking around barefoot.
My son is ashamed of his behavior.
She couldn't have said that.
Does that suit you?
We're powerless.
A typhoon is approaching Japan.
I think maybe Tom has something else to do.
You know how it is.
How did you get interested in art?
I didn't meet him again after that.
It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
Be more careful from now on.
My school marks were average.
I really have no idea.
Do you think you and I are compatible?
The boat can still be seen.
You will soon cease to think of her.
I'll eat after that.
No one has heard Tom say Mary's name.
There was absolutely no furniture in that room.
I don't believe it happened that way.
How long do you study English every day?
I asked him his name.
The whole class was quiet.
I could kiss you.
Why are you so tired today?
Tom is one of the few people I can trust.
Turn your papers in.
Could you send it by email?
This chair is too small.
Where were all of you?
Tom felt helpless and frightened.
We'll miss you.
I have nothing to say with regard to that problem.
This is kind of interesting.
I live in comfort.
Because my mother is sick, my father will cook today.
Tom can't stop Mary from doing that.
I respect those who always do their best.
Let me think this over.
They're able to sing.
See for yourself.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
Tom has a big mouth.
I'd gladly pay more for something if it's of high quality.
She advised him to talk about his life in the United States.
I have to do my homework.
I am very pleased.
We haven't come to a decision yet.
Are they ready to talk?
I thought you were in charge.
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
See you all tomorrow.
The weather is good today.
Let's sing some English songs together.
He scolded her.
Do you have a question?
I'm sure I can do better.
I consider watching television a waste of time.
You're done working, aren't you?
How do you know that light travels faster than sound?
They're weak.
I was so humiliated.
It's easy for her to make friends.
There is no doubt.
You can't change Tom.
Tom bought some vegetables and fruit.
She's too old for you.
The main tap is turned off.
You have given me so many.
Do you really want this information to be made public?
Where is the bridge?
I left a message for Tom.
I sincerely regret having caused you such an inconvenience.
Does anyone have any other questions?
Tom didn't go to Boston.
It is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands.
Tom was just telling me a joke.
My sister likes melons and so do I.
Swiss chocolate really melts in your mouth.
Our teacher sometimes speaks too fast.
The prisoners tried to escape.
When will that occur?
You don't have to explain anything.
Have fun.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
I don't know anybody here in this town.
It was nowhere to be seen.
Keep an eye on it.
She can swim as fast as her brother.
Would you speak more slowly, please?
You can't sit there.
Thank you for helping me.
Left alone, the little girl began to cry.
He devoted a lot of time to study.
How are you now?
Show me the way to the bus stop.
I don't want to talk to you about this.
Someone has walked off with my pencil.
Do what you want with it.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I am leaving town for a few days.
Tom couldn't find it.
Tom doesn't know where Mary learned how to drive.
I never thought it would happen to me.
I got nauseous.
I wouldn't want anyone to see us.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
You're nuts!
The more we have, the more we want.
That's the only way to do it.
I went out with my friends.
Say it in another way.
What activity do you spend most of your time doing?
The company he used to work for went into bankruptcy last month.
There is a traffic jam on the highway.
That's just what I thought.
What are you doing tonight?
You're carrying this too far.
What are you working on?
He extended his right arm.
He sat reading a book.
Is anything happening?
They condemned him for his cruelty to animals.
Tom knew Mary's husband before she got married.
It was your idea.
I really want to kiss you.
Will you buy me some bread, please?
He placed emphasis on the importance of education.
The old man was almost hit by a car.
Why did you open the box?
No one saw anything.
Honesty, I believe, is the best policy.
I've just spoken to your French teacher and he says you're doing well in his class.
Do you like Indonesian food?
Do you know where the bathroom is?
She helped him tie his tie because he didn't know how to.
I agree with the opinion that real estate is overpriced.
I have no more money in my wallet.
I suppose you've already applied for a visa.
How do you think I feel?
Do you want in or not?
I don't feel comfortable posing in the nude.
This box will serve as a table.
I'm not your brother.
I'll allow it.
Ladies and gentlemen, please come this way.
He asked for the money.
I recall less and less of my childhood.
The United States is a country of immigrants.
I beg your pardon?
That was the first time I had ever driven a car.
Tom expected Mary to believe everything he said.
Some children play video games all the time.
What is the price?
This is all very disturbing.
I fell when I was running.
Is it finished?
You're gross!
Take the road on the right.
Chinese calligraphy is considered an art form.
Frankly, I don't like your idea.
I really should finish this right now.
Since it was raining, I took a taxi.
They were responsible for the accident.
What you did to Tom was cruel.
I don't know this game.
I know how you must be feeling.
Could you go to the store and grab some eggs?
Make it smaller.
You shouldn't get married.
I've been way busier than expected.
The news that he was still alive reached us.
Parents must look after the well-being of the their children.
Everything'll be all right.
I like tennis very much.
Don't be so harsh on yourself.
You're with friends.
Most Englishmen are conservative.
You look busy.
I feel like another beer.
They accused me of being a liar.
I know your type.
I think you're cute.
She advised him to see the dentist.
I know what happened to Tom.
I want to visit Korea.
You get used to it.
Tom doesn't have a choice.
Is that what's going on here?
Now that you are grown up, you must not behave like a child.
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I slept all day.
Tom is a member of the SWAT team.
Tom plays the baritone saxophone and Mary plays the alto saxophone.
What time does it start?
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
We are pretty much in agreement.
We tried to cheer him up.
Tom says you've never been to Boston.
Tom doesn't eat as much as Mary.
I'm terrible at math.
I don't mind a bit.
Why are you alone?
The movie was a little disappointing.
I think that was the plan.
The sun gives us light and heat.
He appeared from nowhere.
Can you do a headstand?
You can come along if you want.
I hope we can avoid doing that.
We have a problem.
The trouble with you is that you talk too much.
I don't feel like dancing.
All of them will get a prize.
I want to know who your friends are.
I don't think I'm the only one who noticed.
Do you feel like a drink?
Who's Tom looking at?
Does any other country fan the flames of patriotism as much as America?
I don't want you to change.
I suppose you like it.
Pick up your briefcase.
I saw his car make a right turn.
I need a job.
Do you need a deposit?
I was surprised by Tom's strength.
Do you want to come along?
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
I thought about you a lot.
Can you excuse me for a minute?
Your face is dirty.
I'd like to stand.
Why are you picking a fight with me?
I haven't done this in ages.
I will go there on foot or by bicycle next time.
You can't hypnotize me.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
Do you promise?
I like meat, but eggs do not agree with me.
I cried myself to sleep every night.
I am done teaching.
All things considered, she is a fairly good wife.
What's your favorite subject?
After hearing the tragic news, he went outside to be alone.
I want to find someplace quiet to study.
What other choice did I have?
I have to study for the test.
The rumor was baseless.
That's the point I'm trying to make.
You're horrible.
You know where to find me.
I owe what I am today to my uncle.
It's only a dream.
She is my dream girl.
It took us half an hour to set up the tent.
I'm ready now, Tom.
He is a student at a high school.
I'm really not interested in history.
He does nothing but read comics.
We now know that was a lie.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
They told me about it.
This kind of thing happens all the time.
Drop your weapons!
You should look this word up.
We kept together for safety.
We can't thank you enough.
It took me several hours to write it.
He changed his mind.
It's not that deep.
Why didn't you tell us there was a witness?
I can't explain everything.
Someone has stolen all my money.
Hikers need to carry a compass with them to find their way through the woods.
I have no time.
Everybody's dead.
Will you help me?
That's a horse of a different color.
Could you help us after school?
She was robbed of her purse.
You dropped your pencil.
You should have done so.
Are you free on Tuesday?
He has no eye for women.
You must be strong.
I am too tired to keep on walking.
Tom did it all.
He said nothing that would make her angry.
I invited her to a movie.
Please give me some latitude this time.
Hi everyone, I'm Tom.
A billion adults are illiterate.
I may die tomorrow.
He doesn't read many newspapers.
You drank a beer at lunch, didn't you?
Where are we going next?
It is necessary for you to stop smoking.
How long does it take to go there by bus?
I think I have a cavity.
Where do you want to eat?
I love comic books.
What's your name?
He lives by himself.
Keep this lesson in mind.
I'm not married.
I'll go take a shower now.
I haven't read either of his novels.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
We're taking over.
It's my fault that the cake was burned. I was talking on the phone and didn't notice the time.
I remember the word.
What makes you think that I'm against that?
Everyone in town knows his name.
I realized what was happening.
I think you should go now.
Can I be of any service to you?
This is the village where he was born.
He's fresh out of college.
Call me if you have any problems.
He is very depressed.
I'm strong.
Can I use your pen?
He is impossible to beat.
Let's get this over with quickly.
Just be glad you're OK.
The cause of the accident is not known to us.
Don't try this at home.
Can you clean your bedroom?
I don't believe in religion.
They want you dead.
Did he pass the test?
What gave it away?
He has too much pride.
I knew we'd win.
Humans only live about 70 years.
Lets play video games or something.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
Do you recognize that girl?
We're resigning.
Is this all right?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please explain how to get there.
The company abandoned that project.
The delivery of the goods was delayed due to the storm.
The thermometer says it's thirty degrees in here.
He can't stop laughing.
What time did you wake up?
I don't have anything to say to you.
I had to do this today.
What are your plans for tonight?
She likes to read books.
You should thank him.
I'll be going with you.
You don't have to lie.
By the way, have you ever been to Hokkaido?
You might not want to mention that.
They all thought Tom was crazy.
It was not until yesterday that I knew the news.
Our dorm's heating system isn't working properly.
Let's see if we can come up with a better solution.
My father does not like music.
I think we may have a problem.
I was relaxed.
I'm not at all tired.
I remember everything you tell me.
On Sunday, I go to church.
She can swim further than I can.
Remember what Tom told us.
You're not allowed to eat those.
He likes French more than German.
There are plenty of nice girls out there.
Tom is interested in mathematics.
There is no room for romance in my life.
He tends to get upset over nothing.
He's been drinking beer.
He writes books.
Who is going to play tennis?
Can we afford it now?
Don't blame him for the error.
Who have you told so far?
He avenged his father.
I have a chest pain.
You're lying.
Blame it on the weather.
I caught him stealing pears in the orchard.
No one is around.
I must be blind.
The woman is naked.
Were you able to solve the problem?
I went to sleep during the lesson.
It is abnormal to have the heart on the right side.
He is not the sort of guy who gives in easily.
Her watch is ten minutes slow.
Will you please explain the meaning of this sentence to me?
We're not related.
He is eating.
I'll be back within two hours.
This is how I made it.
Don't make a noise.
Who knows what could happen?
I wonder why karaoke is so popular.
What do you do for fun?
Stay here all night if you want.
I usually have a light breakfast.
You didn't get very far.
Shucks! It was too good to be true.
There's volcanic ash in the atmosphere.
She has a pretty doll.
That's a big deal.
I couldn't stop crying.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
Why are you so tired today?
You guys looked mad.
I can stay.
I thought I was going crazy.
You're pretty good.
I'm sorry, but I can't stay for long.
It's hard to choose.
He appeared young.
There are lots of eggs in that box.
He's the laziest person I know.
I was unable to stand any longer.
It was a complete disaster.
Please fill out the Customs Declaration Form.
He's out of practice.
Have you asked if they want one?
I didn't really care about that.
All the leaves on the tree turned yellow.
He did not die of cancer.
That's not good enough for you.
I forgot the PIN number.
That's the worst thing that could possibly happen.
No matter how long it takes, I will finish the work.
I lost a lot of money.
I think I broke his heart.
You're the one who planted that tree.
I walked in the woods by myself.
That might be a good idea.
Tom introduced his sister to me.
My license was confiscated.
This kind of specialized knowledge has very little to do with daily life.
You have three cars.
It's no good.
Turn in your homework.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
The two brothers died.
Please take off your shoes.
I only think of you.
There's a long line at every cash register.
That was never an option.
Where did I put my keys?
You are my daughter.
It's going to be difficult for us to do that.
I'll believe that when I see it.
It sounds familiar.
I live in this hotel.
He seems to be ill.
Get a job.
Thank you for the Christmas gift.
I don't know what to do about it.
Tom always drinks tea in the morning.
She has a little money put aside.
Are you still playing the bassoon?
I didn't say I liked Tom.
I must find my key.
I love this store.
I felt very uneasy.
I don't want to be your boyfriend.
You know Tom better than anybody.
Why are you drying your hair?
That boy displayed no fear.
I'll meet you outside.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
I hate pretending I'm interested.
I saw Tom entering that restaurant.
Are they brothers?
We live near the border.
Tom got up and walked to the door.
He is close to the president.
It's still my birthday.
I've heard it said that you should never marry your first love.
I didn't know you were awake.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
You don't have to come see me.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
Did you have a rough day?
Go with the flow.
Tom didn't see it.
The new furniture arrived today.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
Tom is a nice guy with a big heart.
He used to get up early.
What kind of sick weirdo are you?
It's a girl thing.
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
That's where I can't agree with you.
I had no idea you'd be here.
You're probably too young to understand why we have to do this.
Don't tell me if you don't want to.
The price includes tax.
Let's go over what we already know.
Can you solve this problem?

What are the conditions?
She asked him to call her later, but he forgot to.
This is between you and me.

I can't believe I'm here again.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
He sat next to the stream.
You're invited.

I hate these words.
He will be delighted to see you.
Not all of us can speak English.
Why didn't you get one before we left?
The fire started immediately.
It's easy to make and it's cheap.
They're not expensive.
There's a good chance that he'll be chosen.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?

I ran across his telephone number in an old address book of mine.
Have you ever been arrested?
You don't look that good.
Have I kept you waiting long?
I cut myself.
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
You just wouldn't understand.
Did you check this?
I will deal with them myself.
Tom was so hungry that he ate dog food.
Autumn is my favorite season.
I want this garbage out of here.
What are you up to tomorrow afternoon?
I was eventually released.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
Are you a policeman?
I want the fan.
What on earth does this have to do with me?
The train left on time.
Disconnect the power cable from the modem, wait for approximately one minute, then reconnect the cable.
I don't want your apologies.
I thought it might be you.
An image is worth a thousand words.
He is fatter than when I last saw him.
The crowd cheered.
Was this letter written by Mary?
The cap is too small for me.
The problem is as good as settled.
I have something very special planned for your birthday.
I decided to buy a car.
That's a depressing story.
This can't happen again.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
It appears that he is mistaken.
She sent me an urgent telegram.
I want you to handle it.
His grades have improved significantly.
Why should I pay that much?
He was accused of theft.
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
The class was too big so we split up into two smaller groups.
We have finished lunch.
At our high school, French is an elective.
I heard from someone that she got married.
She usually gets up early.
I've got some business here.
Tom lost the race.
I can't believe you fell for that.
As soon as we get the tickets, we'll send them to you.
If I had money, I could buy it.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
I am glad to accept your invitation.
She studies English.
They're not my friends.
It is he who is to blame.
I have a feeling that she will come today.
I saw her home.
You should stop drinking.
We can continue playing, as long as we don't make too much noise.
Tom doesn't want to leave.
Music is universal.
How did you answer Tom?
I don't need a suitcase that big.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom started yelling.
I wanted to impress you.
She wouldn't give him a gift.
I'm exhausted.
My sister's getting married.
How about a drink?
Don't worry about others.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
He asked me to return the money to him immediately.
The deadline is drawing near.
One mouse is running around in the room.
Is the dog chained?
I'm tired.
As a matter of fact, she is my sister.
Do you honestly believe that?
Do you think this is real?
The government is not doing its best to solve the housing problem.
Are you afraid of it?
I thought you were broke.
There's nothing more annoying than a group of young girls all trying to talk at the same time.
In England, Labor Day is in May.
The moon is full tonight.
Take the bags upstairs.
You're afraid, aren't you?
I had a mental breakdown.
Please say yes.
Sit up straight.
Please stop talking.
The police chief resigned.
I don't want to tell my parents.
We ran around the park.
It doesn't matter who says that, it's not true.
Have I kept you waiting?
You should know yourself.
The couple broke off their engagement.
I don't want you to worry about me.
I'm starved.
I've already waited two hours. I can't wait any longer.
Are you sure you just want water?
She was clearly satisfied with the results.
The reason is clear.
You've got to be bold!
Would you like to go shopping with me?
Nothing is worse than war.
No one is downstairs.
Tom turned down the heat.
Open your eyes.
Where are the guards?
Tom ignored our advice.
You can't be sure of that.
Tell Tom that everyone is here.
You've never seen a genuine diamond.
I'd like a twin room, please.
I wholeheartedly agree.
His advice encouraged me to try it again.
The cat arched its back and stretched itself.
I will get you a bike for your birthday.
He remained single all his life.
You should be more careful the next time.
That sounds really bad.
You can't be too careful in situations like this.
We'll stop them.
Tom has caused me a lot of trouble.
Even if you are busy, you should keep your promise.
Don't smoke while you are on duty.
I'm going to the station.
Is there anything else you want to know?
You look like a kid.
They are very big.
Unless you started learning English as a child, you're unlikely to ever sound like a native speaker.
What do you call this?
My friend called me a coward.
The snow prevented the train from running.
He's an outlaw.
He was granted admission to the university.
Be discreet.
I've found a better way.
You couldn't possibly understand.
Your glasses fell on the floor.
She is used to living alone.
I think we should go.
I feel relaxed with you.
I am bored to death.
Because of the pills I took, the pain went away.
I had to climb over the fence.
My mother is the first one to get up every morning.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
You don't seem too sure.
He disappeared in the crowd.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
The house did not suffer much damage because the fire was quickly put out.
You always said you wanted to become a scientist. Why didn't you?
Tom is too young.
You work too hard.
The bus stopped, but no one got out.
Her clothes were made of very cheap material.
He fell into the ditch.
She walked slowly so she wouldn't slip.
You must be cautious.
We all need help from time to time.
I have a message I want you to deliver.
This movie is rated R.
You're not that old, Tom.
I can't understand what they were thinking.
I stopped smoking.
The teacher and I sat face to face.
Give me a second.
The meeting isn't over.
I don't have time to deal with this letter. Could you deal with it?
You've been very kind to me.
I realized I couldn't win.
Buy me another beer and I'll think on it.
That book is familiar to all young children.
I want to keep one.
I feel powerless.
She may have missed the train.
He advised caution.
How many slices of meat would you like?
Make your choice.
We may not win tomorrow.
I understand the sentence, but I'm not able to translate it.
Is there another way in?
I'm fully aware of that.
She is teaching us French.
You may want to take a few steps back.
I like to feed the pigeons.
Is that for sale?
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that.
Tom forgot his glasses.
They grow fruit here.
Anyone hurt?
I appreciate what you've done for me.
Have you betrayed me?
He said we must keep the secret.
Don't tell anyone we're doing this.
He did a rough drawing to show me the way to the station.
I gave them a present for their anniversary.
She left her children in her aunt's care.
I found out something.
We'll wait.
He made up the story.
It's all white.
She gave him a few pointers on pronunciation.
What're you all dressed up for?
Some people are still worried.
These are bad times.
Tom really wants to be your friend.
Your death will not have been in vain.
He has adapted extremely well.
The cage is empty.
I was ushered to my seat.
I thought you'd be alone.
What has become of him since then?
I have written down his phone number.
Prices are lower in Kobe.
I have rather a busy afternoon in front of me.
I must go.
What time do you go home?
I've got no reason to stay.
She lives in New York.
When did Tom come see you?
We have some celebrating to do.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
What a lovely dress!
Don't lie to me.
I wish I had been with her then.
I lit the candles.
I fell down the stairs.
Lock the doors.
How long are you staying in Japan?
Can he see me?
We had a very good time last night.
I forgot to lock the door.
Why did you come early?
Don't forget to remind me of that.
He stopped smoking on his doctor's advice.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Is it hard to speak English?
Your plan is bound to fail.
All the parking lots were full.
I ran in order to be on time.
I never worried about Tom.
Let's go by bus.
Quit acting like a baby.
I told everyone to be careful.
To tell the truth, I didn't notice it.
They're right behind me.
He likes coffee without sugar.
Tom calls Mary every night.
We haven't seen it yet.
Come into my room.
I'm very sad.
When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere.
It's human nature.
That bridge is anything but safe.
What's the big hurry?
Democracy is one form of government.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Isn't it infuriating?
He was busy.
I don't know what you really want.
I'll show you the way out.
He does not get up early.
If he hadn't wasted time, he'd be finished by now.
Let's not talk about Tom.
I've got a meeting at 2:30.
I want to show you something I've been working on.
I know Tom and his wife.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
Tom is throwing stones at birds.
I want you to tell me what to do.
Would you please slow down?
I don't know how to contact you.
I'll trust you.
Parallel lines do not intersect each other.
Do you know who invented this machine?
I didn't get the job.
I didn't get a chance to introduce myself to her.
I'll tell you why.
My dad gave up alcohol.
I thought we were on the same side.
I'll be gone for an entire week.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
Close your eyes for three minutes.
That's not good enough for Tom.
I'm thorough.
He wants the most bang for his buck.
It's another ball of wax.
Would you say they match?
This is a desk.
He's curious about everything.
What do you mean by it?
I want you to be my coach.
It's a little dated.
Tom doesn't know whether to turn left or right.
You've put on a little weight, haven't you?
This just might come in handy someday.
Oil has played an important part in the progress of civilization.
You should go talk to him.
I've been waiting for him for an hour.
Maybe she can tell you more.
You should give up smoking.
Do you have health insurance?
Is her father a teacher?
You have to make the crease very straight.
When did they build that?
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Your thirty minutes are up.
Don't wait.
This handle will not turn.
I thought you might be upset.
Do you talk to your dog?
I hate the guy next door.
He robbed an old lady.
He went there in person.
It was not until I left school that I realized the importance of study.
What's the matter with you?
We need to cut costs.
The game was called off.
I love weddings.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
That's my cat.
When spring comes, they dig up the fields and plant seeds.
Tom is about to fall asleep.
I would love to come with you all, but I don't have any money.
It's a bit extreme.
This building belongs to my family.
Take no chances.
How about tonight?
Can you still remember the time we first met?
I forgot to tell you what time the meeting's going to start.
This grocery store only sells organic food.
Let's eat out tonight.
Don't be a moron.
I want your love.
I really like puppies.
I feel like I'm forgeting something.
She is two years older than you.
I'm surprised.
I want to make a good impression.
Have you got a match?
We're not from around here.
Are you about done?
You are abusing your authority.
People say that I dream every night, but if I do, I can't ever remember any of my dreams.
You'd better go to bed at once.
I just want the truth.
I want the money you owe me and I want it now.
I doubled over with laughter.
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I surprised myself.
I'm curious.
It's right next door.
I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice.
There are some books on the desk.
He drinks a glass of water every morning.
The next step was to sign the document.
These clothes are dirty and need to be washed.
I put on my trousers.
You talk really fast.
Do you have a ticket?
I woke up at sunrise.
Driving too fast is dangerous.
I couldn't answer any questions on the test.
I'll come with you.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
I appreciate the help.
Are you busy now?
Why don't you take your temperature?
Your problem is you're not patient enough.
He was not able to join in the discussion.
We asked him on the interphone if he could come downstairs quickly.
Apparently, the bus is late.
I thought you were smart.
I don't even have a girlfriend.
I'll teach you how to drive a car.
You're not listening!
I'd like to borrow about three hundred thousand dollars.
Don't get excited.
Once you begin, you must continue.
I can handle this.
No more, thank you. I'm full.
I know her very well.
I'm glad you decided to come.
We enjoyed ourselves at the picnic.
Read the article on page two.
A chain is made up of many links.
The window was open.
Tom showed me how to do it.
You can't leave until you've said goodbye to Tom.
She was about to go out.
How much do you know about artificial intelligence?
I hope I'm not bothering anybody.
I don't know if I'll be able to help you on Monday.
Tom is trying to get it right.
I left my tennis racket on the train.
Don't do that.
Six o'clock will suit me very well.
I really appreciate you helping me out.
I seldom see him.
Please stop.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
That was the most interesting film that we had ever seen.
I had the door repaired.
My heart is pounding so hard it feels like it's going to explode.
I know that Tom likes jazz.
I'm glad to see you again.
I have no food.
Birds are natural enemies of insects.
This highway saves us a lot of time.
He has only a superficial knowledge of the subject.
No wonder they turned down her offer.
Just do what I did.
He asked if I like Chinese food.
Each member has to pay a membership fee.
Are you up for it?
The speaker couldn't make himself heard.
You're the leader.
I crossed the street.
What drives you?
I see they've put you to work.
I can pick you up from work if you want me to.
Who are you to decide?
Are you recording this?
Do I annoy you?
Can you show me how to do this?
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
Would you like me to go there with you?
Did I say your name right?
The boy admitted having broken the vase.
The situation is getting worse and worse day by day.
He has started to write a novel.
The girls won.
You're the one that went crazy.
He didn't keep his word.
Does he go to school by bus?
The meeting will take place tomorrow.
This is a dangerous mission.
I had a good time tonight.
What does this stand for?
I can wait for you.
Is this appropriate?
Except for leap years, February has only 28 days.
The painting is all but finished.
This door would not open.
Do you have nightmares?
I love all of you.
It's outdated.
Please turn in your homework by tomorrow.
I appreciate the compliment.
Stop staring.
How big will it be?
For goodness' sake, please be nice to him.
I can't help you now.
My sister is a very good typist.
I'll look after your affairs when you are dead.
A red light was glowing in the dark.
I want to practice with you.
I wish I had a friend like you.
My mother plays the piano well.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
Do not tell me what to do.
I could not stop laughing.
Gardening is fun.
Who do you think he is?
I want everyone to bring their children.
Don't be so negative.
The Allies wasted no time.
Do you have an opinion?
What's your favorite hair style?
I'm sure that I'll miss her a lot.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
Is there a problem with your hearing?
Please answer my question.
Who wants you to be the boss?
You will soon get to like her.
You can rent a boat by the hour.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
Tell me where you went.
Ask if he wants another drink.
She talks about Paris as if she had been there many times.
You must be mentally exhausted.
You need to be more patient.
I don't want to live by myself.
You're going to ruin your eyes.
I've been debating whether I should mention it or not.
I don't have any money on me.
I want you focus on the here and now.
I like my life the way it is now.
Today is my birthday.
Finally, I found a job.
Who discovered America?
I got you confused with your oldest brother.
They're in the garden.
You're all crazy.
I am ashamed.
I'm not the only one who got here early.
We make mistakes.
I think I understood.
I am almost ready.
I'm younger than I look.
I no longer love him.
She stopped talking.
Cars parked illegally on this street will be impounded.
I speak a little Japanese.
Did you enjoy the game?
Don't drink and drive.
I had nothing in particular to say.
It isn't what he says that annoys me but the way he says it.
We need information.
I'm from the city.
It doesn't make any sense.
How many audiobooks do you have on your iPod?
Without a dictionary, it would be hard to study English.
I'm awfully tired.
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
Ferrets are playful and curious.
I have nothing to say.
Why is everybody shouting?
How do you want me to handle that?
I don't like either of them.
Check your answer with his.
That's an old wives' tale.
I'm rather busy.
How have you been doing lately?
She does not speak English as fluently as you.
We declared war.
The ship is now in the harbor.
He likes all kinds of sports.
You're very emotional.
Why are you saying goodbye?
Are you doing what you think is right?
How did we not see it?
I'm resentful.
I wish there were more people like you.
Talk to my boss.
Please prepare for the trip.
This is Tom's locker.
Does he have a girlfriend?
I'm afraid we have no choice.
I thought you were serious.
Don't worry about that.
She was the first one to pay attention to him.
Are you sure you don't know Tom?
The train approached the town.
How's everyone doing today?
I couldn't make him understand my English.
I need a little help here.
I hope my dream will come true.
I didn't know why I wasn't supposed to go to that part of town.
I have a dictionary.
His new novel has become a best-seller.
I can deliver that to Tom.
Why does he look grumpy?
What was it?
I was able to find the book I was looking for.
If I'd only taken your advice!
Can you please help me for just a minute?
We usually talked in English.
I feel like walking.
We found it here.
Don't you want to come inside?
This is a life-sized statue.
Tom turned pale.
Do you have a crush on my brother?
I just got here yesterday.
Can I borrow this umbrella?
I'm begging you.
Do you mind much?
They got the short end of the stick.
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
I didn't ask.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
I took it for granted that you would come.
I promise you I'll keep you safe.
The garrison was forced to surrender.
She gave me a lovely watch, but I lost it.
Let's drink to our charming hostess!
Does Tom dye his hair?
The most beloved people in the world are the spontaneous.
Is the Orient too foreign for you?
They said you were fired.
Are you about done?
The furniture in this office is really modern.
Are you deaf?
You can never tell how long these meetings will last.
I know you've been avoiding me.
He exhaled loudly.
Tom is hoping you'll do it.
He has enough money.
Are you ready to go out?
I did it quickly.
Do you find that washing machine easy to use?
I need sugar.
I missed the train by a minute.
I don't see the problem.
I went to the market.
My throat's a little dry.
Do you know how to use a dictionary?
Stick out your tongue.
Be merciful.
I can't stop Tom.
I got dumped.
Are they the people you saw yesterday?
Was I really boring?
Just try it out.
She's gone on a trip.
Girls are crazy.
Is there anything you want to say?
He went to Paris at the end of May.
He fell to the floor.
Tom is the one that doesn't like me.
It was not an accident.
Come at any time you like.
Don't make it any more difficult.
I had nothing to say.
You don't want to see this, do you?
All of us stood up.
Can you do it faster?
It was a crime of passion.
I don't know why it happened.
We saw an interesting program on television yesterday.
She fell in love with him.
She did not read the book.
I'm tired of waiting.
I apologized immediately.
Tom disappeared into the crowd.
I'd like to live in the suburbs of Kobe.
We are concerned about our planet.
What is your problem?
I'm sorry I didn't make it to your party.
Appearances are deceiving.
It looks really good.
He was challenged to a drinking contest.
I think they're ready.
That's more like it.
I'd like to be alone now.
We'll succeed.
He does not listen.
I love the sun.
You can't be too careful in situations like this.
Tom doesn't like my friends.
Tom thought Mary could do it.
I knew all along that he was telling a lie.
My apartment is more comfortable than yours.
Why don't you come in?
They're students.
We need to take this into account.
I want you to go to your room and pack your things.
I do have one question.
I may not be completely objective.
They made us work all day.
Going out drinking with the guys makes him feel macho.
We have finished lunch.
Don't you see what that means?
Take as long as you need.
His novel is beyond my comprehension.
I can't make heads or tails of what you said.
He is a good speaker.
This vending machine takes only hundred-yen coins.
We gave them food.
I wasn't entirely sure myself.
He is a bad boy.
She's out shopping for shoes.
Tom's French is improving.
I blamed him for the accident.
See you tomorrow.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal something like that.
You can't give up.
Your marriage is in trouble.
They live on the floor beneath.
I thought we were going to die.
I saw what you did.
Why did you say such a thing?
He gets a haircut once a month.
I don't know what to do with it.
I wish I were a bird.
He was advanced to the rank of general.
It's making me nervous.
Will you drive me home?
Something must have happened to him on the way.
I want to study German.
I'm sure Tom is suffering.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
Japan's rice market is closed to imports.
Let's have a glass of champagne.
Were you at home yesterday?
You're very sharp.
How do you know what I had?
Look in front of you.
Can you please do this for me?
I'm as curious as you are.
This watch was given me by my uncle.
That's Tom's house.
I thought I recognized Tom.
The Great Lakes supply drinking water.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
I do not like tea, so I generally drink coffee for breakfast.
If it is worth doing, do it well.
How many books have you read?
I can't believe we're here.
I really appreciate the offer.
I want to avoid rush hour.
Tom stepped off the train.
Tom was badly beaten before being killed.
Tom should've been an actor.
Be careful about what you eat.
What's wrong with that?
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.
Tom and Mary don't like the same kind of music.
I'll call you after lunch.
You're my only real friend.
It's easy to see the fireworks from over there.
He's after me.
I saw you cooking.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Why are you busy today?
When we started out in this business, many people said that we would fail.
Tom says he thinks it's a waste of time to vote.
What were you hoping to see?
That person is like me.
I forgot my glasses.
It's a whole other ball game.
The machine operates around the clock.
We know all about you.
Tom and Mary decided to leave.
Would you please send me details of your products via e-mail as an attachment?
You're temperamental.
I want to see what happens.
Everyone should exercise their right to vote.
They were put in prison.
You must've thought I was an idiot.
We have an agreement.
That's good news to me.
They all joined in the chorus.
Anything that can be misunderstood will be.
Do you feel at home anywhere?
I'll show you.
See you tomorrow in the library.
Where's your shirt?
Wait till the light turns green.
I forgot to ask Tom.
The tree fell down by itself.
He doesn't mince words.
He did it for the money.
He tried to kill himself.
The coal is burning.
I have high blood pressure.
I knew before you knew.
We are a family.
We have an unusual relationship.
Tom drove his car to Boston.
I don't remember, but I wish I did.
I thought Tom was in school.
The cough syrup has a licorice flavoring.
I found it necessary to get up early every morning.
Tom drank too much wine.
He is about thirty.
I have nothing to tell you for the moment.
Tom was very patient.
Yours is better.
I'd like to go to my room.
I can hardly walk.
What does it matter?
They built their empire in Peru about five hundred years ago.
Thank you for considering me for the job.
We'd better leave him alone.
I'm used to this sort of thing.
She can handle it.
I think you should listen to me.
I want to make friends with your sister.
He had to go through a lot of hardships.
He will have no chance of winning her heart.
Those people are political allies and will help each other.
You have only to watch what I do.
Everyone dies eventually.
He has more books than he can ever read.
It's all yours.
Tom wanted to help Mary.
We're not in the 80s anymore.
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk.
Do not take any notice of him.
May I turn on the television?
Was there a scandal?
I don't sleep a lot.
Be careful about what you eat.
Everybody knows we hate Tom.
She sent him a message.
It is time you told her the truth.
I know who you were with.
I don't even have one.
They were motivated by revenge.
Could you say that again?
It matters a lot.
The world's greatest singers and most of its famous musicians have been fat or at least decidedly plump.
We've looked everywhere, haven't we?
You're very clever.
Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything.
I have a friend whose father is a famous novelist.
They never found out the truth.
You were sleeping, weren't you?
Did you play tennis yesterday?
There is cranberry juice in the fridge.
It's a piece of cake.
The hailstones were as big as tennis balls.
Just take a deep breath.
There were no resignations.
Tom doesn't have enough time for a cup of coffee.
It's not an either-or situation.
Is there something I can get for you?
A dog is barking.
Tom dove into the water.
I was writing her a love letter.
His teeth were white.
I love shopping for clothes.
Tom sang better than Mary did.
Tom is more famous than I am.
We're going to get in trouble for that.

I feel like going out rather than staying at home today.
It was a very good experience for him.
I agreed with her.
I didn't like that.
How interesting!
Tom waited for thirty minutes.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We don't have that.
May I try it?

He grew up in a small town.

I'd be happy if that happened again.
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
He has a brother and two sisters.
She knows the truth.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
When are you going home?
You don't smoke, do you?
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

I wasn't aware that you were so ill.
I have enough money to buy it.
She enjoyed conversing with him.
It looks like the question was too easy for you. Next time, I'll have to make it a bit harder.
How much money do you have in your pockets right now?
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.

The boat sank during the storm.

We're not fighting.
He headed for the door at full speed.
He would often go fishing.
I am the happiest man on earth.
I'm worried about him.
I can't put up with the noise any longer.
She continued with the work.
Don't let me catch you doing anything like this again.
How beautiful she is!
She has never danced with him.

You're very upset.
I didn't write anything.
He has changed.
I'm allergic to corn.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
Tom knew there was a problem.
I like your attitude.
Let's stop here.
What a small world!
It could be a trap. Don't let your guard down.
I wasn't joking.
Where are your friends going?
Don't walk out on me again.
I think we're getting close.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
Your theory has no scientific basis.
Stir the paint with a stick.
Every time I read the Bible, I am deeply moved.

It's a nice party.
We must be cautious.
Where've you been all afternoon?
We've no choice.
She is mad at you.
The journey has just begun.
We couldn't have done this without your help.
He ignored me.

That was a pretty good move.
She is no ordinary singer.
Can you show us how to do that?
I am not happy.

They're keeping it under wraps.
You're disgusting.
Don't make me do it again.
We can't be sure, can we?
How much did they give you for your old car?
I saw you there.
"What are these?" "They are your pictures."
Can you ride a bicycle?
We had a pleasant evening.
You can't let it get to you.
I'm more than happy.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
Nobody has the right to control us.

It's a good school.
I'm younger than I look.
I guess we're finished.
Could you pass me the salt, please?
Where's your family, Tom?
Just ignore it.
She made the same mistake again.
That makes everything simpler.
I think my girlfriend is kind of cute.
Does this mean that we have to file bankruptcy?
I told you not to play your cello late at night, but you did and now the neighbors have complained.
You're the oldest.
We went on foot.
Unless you start now, you'll be late.
I'm just getting started.
Do you get up at six?
I was busy cooking.
I love her all the more for her faults.
I never imagined he'd do that to me.
He did what I wanted right away.
That's very considerate of you.
When did you last see my brother?
They set up a new company in London.
It's our only hope.
I had him fix my watch.
Don't fret.
It's the first thing that I do in the morning.
Would you mind closing the door?
She takes care of my children.
I'd like to spend less time at work and more time at home.
You don't need to wait.
Tom hasn't seen the video yet.
He ran away so he wouldn't be caught.
That's a stupid name.
Everything is all right now.
I want a boyfriend.
My older sister got engaged.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
I need to go there.
I used to live near a park.

Where they burn books, they will eventually burn people.
Why did you try to run away?
It's your money.
You are no longer welcome here.
They are as strong as us.
It's a misunderstanding.
We'd make a perfect team.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
All you have to do is apologize for being late.
My eyes are sore.
Do you buy that explanation?
What are your plans for Christmas?
What woke you up?
Although he is young, he is very careful.
Why can't I see you?
I went to Boston to visit Tom.
I'll call back soon.
Everything's ready.
She likes cooking for her family.
They invited me to play cards.
I thought I was happy.
I don't want to see you again.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
Who are you supposed to be?
My headache is finally gone.
I should get back to my seat.
I find it difficult to believe that.
I thought it would be an opportunity for you to improve your French.
She is a quiet woman.
I want you to understand this isn't going to be easy.
She writes to her son every now and then.
Tom loves being outdoors.
You don't know German, do you?
Is he your teacher?
I know you're upset.
I just wanted to let you know.
Tom has been up all night.
If you want me to, I'll do that for you.
What did they hit you with?
How dare you speak like that to me?
You don't seem very satisfied.
What do you think about Japan's educational system?
Please make yourself at home.
I just want to be different.
I don't understand what she wants me to do.
I hope you're not offended.
He's saving up to go to college.
She made me a star.
I had a very good time.
I came back.
They tried to swim to safety.
I'd really like to sleep in.
How do we find it?
Men do not exist in this world to become rich, but to become happy.
I folded the towel in half.
Who picked you for this job?
Tom put a star on top of the Christmas tree.
Evidently, it's going to rain tomorrow.
When you love someone, you'll do anything to make that person happy.
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
Don't close your eyes.
He doesn't live there anymore.
Hot, dry areas will become hotter and drier.
That's all I need.
Can I make one observation?
I wonder if she is staying at that hotel.
They're afraid of him.
I know just what you need.
He's here trying to stir up trouble.
Many criminals in America are addicted to drugs.
How are you holding up?
She is expecting a baby in June.
I promised I'd tell you the truth.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
Keep it together, Tom.
It's been a long time since I've seen any dragonflies in this area.
We wanted to listen.
We walked to the river.
Tom is still very unhappy.
I'm sure Tom was involved.
He looks much better now.
You did the right thing.
This sentence has five words.
I don't know how to contact you.
I might be drunk, but I'm not crazy.
I asked him to drive me home.
I want one.
I stopped at the supermarket on my way home.
We had fine weather on that day.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
I studied all week for that quiz.
I am thankful for the food I eat.
It's kind of fun.
We sent out the invitations yesterday.
I'll go wherever you want me to go.
I can't forgive him for behaving like that.
If you want something to be done right, sometimes you've just got to do it yourself.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the intersection.
He plays soccer.
I am not ready yet.
Would you be willing to write a letter for me?
Make good use of your time.
Do you like this garden?
They voted.
I tried to save him.
I wouldn't try that again.
Do you need anything else?
I know this will work.
That problem isn't important.
I bought an electric car.
You heard correctly.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
My eyes get tired very easily.
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
They finished their meal.
One of these eggs hasn't hatched yet.
I had an awful day.
Who is their homeroom teacher?
Rugby is an outdoor game.
Tom is a bit strange.
I think we'd better be going.
How about this one?
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I'm so proud of you.
Please note that the price is subject to change.
Hurry up, girls.
Tom intends to live in Boston for more than a year.
An awning broke his fall and saved his life.
I'll tell you what I know.
Many English words are derived from Latin.
Do you have any idea where Tom might have put his camera?
I can recommend a good lawyer.
You're very forward.
What are some foods you usually eat with chopsticks?
The candle burned out.
I want to apologize to you for calling you a jerk in front of your girlfriend.
It is not my intent to hurt you in any way.
They visited their parents yesterday.
He has gone to Osaka on urgent business.
The mistakes are mine.
The workers took pride in their work.
You'll find something that interests you.
Do you see anything?
The town is beautiful.
Tom told me you needed some money.
I'm anxious to see you.
Look at the blackboard.
It may snow in the evening.
That seems right.
I'm your doctor.
They all laughed at his jokes.
He bribed the judge and got off scot-free.
Is Tom a good kisser?
They don't teach you that in school.
I was overwhelmed.
He always talks as if he knows everything.
Last summer, I worked part time on a farm.
Many people use cash machines to withdraw money.
Mary invested in the stock because the financial advisor fooled her.
I feel like I should say something, but I don't know what.
I want to stay with you.
It won't be easy.
The travelers stayed at a seaside hotel.
It is difficult to shoot a bird flying in the air.
I tried writing with my left hand.
This product is fun to use.
How many more forks do we need?
I took the wrong bus.
I've made up my mind.
He tried many different methods.
It's October the third.
He is a man of reason.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
The children were left to fend for themselves.
You don't really want this job, do you?
I'm sure that's wrong.
The story had a happy ending.
You look so cool.
That would be fine.
I know how important Tom is to you.
Bees fly from flower to flower.
We used to play musical chairs in elementary school.
The family had its dinner at noon.
I'm tired of working a nine-to-five job.
Did you find everything you want?
He did it not once, but twice.
I've come a long way.
When was this car washed?
I was tempted.
I saw him just now.
You mean the world to me, you really do.
They ate marshmallows.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
Put your hat back on.
Look! The airplane is taking off.
He may have missed his usual bus.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
Please don't tell anyone.
It's all in a day's work.
She takes after her father.
You should've notified us.
I asked him where he was going.
I don't want to be rich. I just don't want to be poor.
You may go.
Tom explained why he was there.
You need to press the button.
I didn't ask you that.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I live in Boston.
I've never been in love before.
You didn't complain, did you?
I am unable to agree on that point.
She married a sailor.
I hope I can manage to make both ends meet.
You can't intimidate us.
He referred to his past experience in his speech.
Apart from on rainy days, I always ride my bike to work.
I suppose you know all about it.
Tom died in prison.
I know who didn't do what they were supposed to do.
Is anybody home?
Don't leave them alone.
I know why Tom is in trouble.
Tom is very afraid of snakes.
Help me for just a minute.
He's wearing a new coat.
You're kidding!
I am hungry because I did not eat breakfast.
That's so ironic.
I like being with you.
I hope you'll reconsider.
Let's see what happens.
I just want to go back to bed.
That's why he lost his job.
It's rather impressive.
They're looking for you.
When did you quit smoking?
What time does this train reach Yokohama?
How can you not see that?
Sorry to bother you, but I'm afraid something urgent has come up.
I cannot thank you enough for your kindness.
Expedited delivery will cost an additional ten dollars.
How long will it take to get there?
Let me write that down.

What was the weather like?

Did anyone say anything?
They concluded he was lying.
I didn't pay.
I have to do what's right.
I want to know how you know that.
Do you think this is real?
I'm dissatisfied.

I admit that it's strange.

Please do not kill me.
Get on your feet.
Come to lunch with us.
Tom is voting.
We don't like the rain.
I told you not to call me at work.
I just thought you were happy.
He may have said so.
I can't keep up with you if you walk so fast.

We all want to go home.
That's not unusual.
Your question is hard to answer.
She accompanied him on the piano.
What's your favorite board game?
Tom is a decent sort of guy.
She can handle it.
He has just left home.

There's something I have to tell you.
You don't really want that, do you?
Do you ever sleep?
Could you turn the heat down, please?
He used the dictionary.
Tom told me you were in Boston.
Winter is right around the corner.
They sat in a circle.
She called him every other day.
How did you know my name?
When I visited my hometown this summer, I found the city different from what it had been ten years ago.
What do you really mean?
I'll meet you at the bus station.
Who can blame you?
I have an older brother.
We'll all be there.
I am convinced of your innocence.
He left the room as soon as I entered it.
Why don't you read it for yourself?

Tom's question took Mary by surprise.
There's no one else here.
She wore a pretty hat.
Let's not be enemies.
That stuff is poison.
Can I bring you anything else?
I don't think we've been introduced.
I think I saw a ghost in the woods.
Was it difficult to make?
Did you have breakfast?
Wait until your father gets home.
Could I have some more coffee?
They started working right away.
You are, so to speak, a fish out of water.
Did you lend any money to my brother?
He was frozen to death.
I think you know why I'm here.
That is essential.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't have a brother.
It is wrong to steal.
It's important that you understand.
I enjoyed talking with him at the party.
I don't think this is a problem.
Tom told Mary he wasn't married.

What is wrong with him?
I ran across an old friend near the bank.
May I borrow your car?
She heard him cry.

Could you show me the way to the port?
I really want a motorcycle.
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
As a matter of fact, I know nothing about him.
You're wasting ammo.
Selling cars is my business.
What's causing the delay?
Is anything wrong?
You're a funny guy.
You deserve the prize.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
I will translate.

I was sorry.
Maybe Tom was the one who stole your bicycle.
Who is your teacher?
I want you to tell me how to do this.
If you eat that much, you'll get sick.
Tom claims he knows nothing about Mary.
I didn't ask you to do that.
She was happy to be introduced to him at the party.
He made believe he was a doctor.
How did you find us?
I could tutor you.
This is all he has to do.
I'll never understand you.

He looked around.
You can smoke in this room.
After taking a bath, Tom ate dinner.
Every boy and girl is taught to read and write.

I'm being patient.
We lost the game.
His behavior disappointed many of his friends.
That sounds depressing.
Nothing feels right.
You're very funny.
I just saw the news.

Your car handles easily.
That's good to hear.
You're cruel.
Do a better job next time.
I was almost hit by a car.
How much is it going to cost?
How stupid he is!
She took him for all his money.
Are you certain about this?
This won't solve anything.
I asked her to go to a movie with me.
I know you were in Boston last summer.

Who sent you?
What do you want it for?

They have a beautiful house.
I know some of these girls.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Let's finish the job.
I slept very well last night.
All possible means have been tried.
Does it hurt?
He has a large family to support.
You can't blame me for that.
He inherited the house.
She badly needed the money.
Yesterday, I bought a book.
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
This is a road map.
He abandoned all hope.
You must be in good physical condition.
I know a woman whose first and last names are the same as mine.
He has taken over his father's business.
Why is that of interest?
Tom was chosen among 300 applicants.
Sorry, I can't help you.
You've been drinking, haven't you?
We went to London last year.
Everyone else waited.
Stop badgering me.
Take your hat off when you enter a house of worship.
What is the emergency telephone number?
Where did you find the keys?
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
I think you're lying.
I hate pretending I'm interested.
Hang on.
A female friend of mine loves to go to gay bars with me.
I managed to catch the 8 o'clock train by running all the way to the station.
I'd like you to meet my wife.
You run very fast.
They robbed me blind.
Were you listening to the radio yesterday?
In recent years, science has made remarkable progress.
I'm so embarrassed.
I reckon you should do it.
It's a fairly complicated problem.
You're quite smart.
It appears that he was in a hurry.
You're very busy.
I don't like your smile.
He did a real snow job on my daughter.
Tom is a little angry at Mary.
Get lost!
I didn't steal it. You can check my pockets.
Our ancestors came to this country 150 years ago.
Tell me what's going on.
I think you lied to me.
I didn't want you to get involved.
Since there was no taxi, I had to walk home.
Where did you work before you came here?
I'm not very organized.
I can't give up on my dreams.
Are you seeing anybody?
I'd just like to know what I did wrong.
I suddenly feel depressed.
I want to buy a new bicycle.
There are many red flowers in the garden.
You bet I'm angry.
Keep the meter running.
Don't make me use this gun.
My uncle gave me his car.
You gave me only fifty cents.
Please fill out this questionnaire and send it to us.
What do you like?
The man is right.
I hate rainy days.
You can only use it once.
This is normal.
You were told to stay on the ship.
This will make a big difference.
What will you do with this camera?
Let's leave early.
My father is very strict with me.
I'd appreciate an answer as soon as possible.
Where are they?
I sat watching an exciting game on television.
It was not my intention to hurt your feelings.
Come with me.
Don't write in red ink.
I gave it back.
I'm always hungry.
Let's get some sleep.
She often goes to the movies with him.
I go to bed at ten o'clock at night.
Can you tell me about it?
I thought you'd be much fatter.
He doesn't want you to know.
That a boy!
That car is hers.
What have you done to him?
You can't swim here.
His smile put her at ease.
Is that going to happen soon?
That's crazy.
Everyone in the room checked their watches at the same time.
Adding comments makes reading the code easier.
There is a marked difference between them.
Tom heard everything we said.
I couldn't stand looking at it.
This blue backpack is heavy.
Open the safe.
Why don't you quit?
They forgot to lock the door.
This is always the way it has been.
There's no way to know.
I knew I'd find you here.
I have found your dirty little secret.
My sister married him in spite of our objections.
It has happened before and it will probably happen again.
You're the best.
I did you a favor.
I had no other choice.
Tom went to the circus with Mary.
What does she say?
I'd rather stay home with you.
You can not appreciate the poem until you have read it many times.
I don't have time right now.
You can't go out there.
It took them some time to get used to each other.
Come closer and have a good look at this picture.
You have such beautiful, hazel eyes.
I don't think this is for you.
He made an abrupt departure.
In the end, we ended up eating at that shabby restaurant.
I am afraid of death.
It's going to be difficult to do that.
Have a nice trip!
It's been seven years since we got married.
We're contented.
It's about 8 kilometers away.
I've got better things to do than to sit here listening to your gossip.
Can I borrow one for about two weeks?
It's your duty to finish the job.
This is what you're supposed to do.
She invited him in for a cup of coffee.
Over 300 people were arrested.
Only time will tell.
She danced with him at the high school prom.
He went traveling in search of adventure.
Are they busy?
He let go of the rope.
I'm too old for Tom.
Do you know your blood type?
I have many friends in foreign countries.
When did I say that?
It is not easy to be understood by everybody.
It was so hot I took my coat off.
What is for dessert?
He saved a hundred dollars.
I like this book.
They are as strong as us.
She made me a cake.
I don't think you have much choice.
I used to be like you.
Tom doesn't remember if he locked the door.
He doesn't like us.
On my way home from school yesterday, I was caught in a shower.
You may open the window.
I thought you were right.
You can go anyplace you like.
She didn't like her husband.
I've got a new bike.
I do know that.
I'm disappointed that he's not here.
Let's buy this one.
One of my bags is missing.
Don't try this at home.
A magnet can pick up and hold many nails at a time.
Don't repeat that.
I don't have the key.
Tom is a thief.
The girl is reading with her grandfather.
I like running.
We saw it.
I don't know if I'll have time to do it.
He's accustomed to traveling.
I'm unemployed.
Farmers are busy working in the field.
I didn't think you were home.
What do you want to do tomorrow?
I have been expecting you.
The strange-looking woman was thought to be a witch.
Yeah, you're right.
Does that seem strange to you?
I don't know why I keep doing that.
Because of modern communication and transportation systems, the world is getting smaller.
Tom needs help.
I sometimes dream of home.
Our son died during the war.
We looked at each other.
They're really tight.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
Do you understand that?
You know what you must do.
I'll call the chef.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
Generally speaking, Americans like coffee.
It's really big.
She became scared when she noticed the man following her.
The sky became darker and darker.
He said good night to his parents.
The new students entered the hall full of hope.
How do you intend to do it?
Wash your hands before eating.
I didn't kiss Tom.
What do you say to going out for a short walk?
Africa is a continent; Greenland is not.
I liked this book.
My shoelace got caught in the escalator.
He wants you to come home.
On my way home, I came across an old friend.
How is that question germane to what we're discussing?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
That dog is really ugly.
The more you have, the more you want.
You look incredible.
He'll be back soon.
I thought everyone knew.
Just looking at a picture of food makes me feel nauseous.
You'll never be alone.
God knows why.
They'll kill me.
You don't want to be late for practice.
Give me back my hat.
I'm fascinated.
What's your favorite wine?
My sister is very fond of children.
The bridge was built by the Romans.
You're very timid.
He asked me for help.
I have plenty of friends.
The poor girl went blind.
I can't focus on two things at the same time.
This is the book that I told you about.
It's time to go back home.
Tom asked Mary why she was smiling.
My younger sister got married in her teens.
I'll leave the decision to you.
Our main problem remains unsolved.
Have you ever been on TV?
I don't actually have them.
My wife died of cancer.
I thought you might be upset.
What would you like?
I actually don't know the answer.
Nothing is happening.
I'll watch it.
This is correct.
Tell me what to do with it.
Isn't that your dictionary?
Those who want to remain may do so.
They were members of the middle class.
He's my partner.
How do you plan on paying for that?
You almost died.
I'm willing to help him.
You can't have this.
He knows how to behave in public.
I suppose everyone thinks I'm crazy.
We are to eat at six.
The coat doesn't have any pockets.
Concerning this matter, I'm the one to blame.
Hurry up, or you will be late for school.
Are you sure you're up for it?
She offered her seat to an old woman.
I'm not at all afraid.
Do you know where the girl lives?
We regard him as our hero.
Tom never saw her again.
I won't leave you behind.
I feel normal.
I only wish I could see you more often.
I can't afford to buy anything in this store.
I was as surprised as you.
You're really selfish.
We have to put right what we have done wrong.
I outrank you.
I lost my key.
He speaks English with a Russian accent.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I'm old enough to drink.
A guard is outside.
Thank you, sir, for your kindness.
He's a total wreck.
He is mentally handicapped.
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it.
When will you get married?
My college has a dorm.
His children have grown up.
Which key is it?
I'm blind.
You should stop.
You're not a killer and neither am I.
I want to travel with you.
We heard the door shut.
I have a fish tank.
Where would you like to go first?
Don't you know his name?
Our success was due to his efforts.
I think it's time for me to move to the suburbs.
I have one sister.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
I'm sure that's wrong.
The house was struck by lightning yesterday.
I have a headache.
Close your eyes again.
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
She explained the reason why she was late.
Words failed her.
There is a lake in front of my house.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I'll act as a guide for you.
Why are you sitting there?
When did you get back from Boston?
When you come next time, bring your brother.
Draw a straight line.
I don't know why I have to do this.
I asked him to leave at once.
You can borrow three books at a time.
It's very hot, isn't it?
Tom closes his eyes when he swims underwater.
Mary took the cookies out of the oven.
I want one!
How long are you planning on staying?
I thought about it a lot.
What do we call you?
I've decided to quit my job at the end of this month.
She had nothing to do yesterday.
I'll think about it over the weekend.
Tom made quite a lot of money in his twenties.
I can't tell you how to do that.
I told Tom what he had to do.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants to eat for dinner.
What did you do with my luggage?
He had his hair cut.
I hope you enjoyed it.
Should we tell everybody or not?
It is high time you were in bed.
Would you consider giving me a small loan?
I don't mind it.
I bought these flowers for you.
I can look at it when you're ready.
You've got your permit, right?
Just take a deep breath.
He made a mistake and drank poison.
This one is bigger.
Let's take advantage of the vacation to go on a hike.
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
He bit his lip.
How much thinner do you want to be?
How do I know that you're not going to try to kill me?
Life is beautiful.
They're going to torture Tom.
I was just taking a shower.
Be a good girl.
He's kind of handsome.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
I have a lot of work to do today.
Why didn't you listen to me?
Cabbage can be eaten raw.
Why don't we drive out to the country for a change of pace?
I wonder what has become of her.
A man's worth lies in what he is rather than what he has.
I want to find out where it came from.
They asked for an increase of salary.
They did what they were told.
I have to go to a meeting.
I just don't want to talk about it.
This will be one of the best memories of my life.
I forced him to carry the suitcase.
No news is good news.
I am going to have a great day today.
I wish I were a little taller.
He moved back with his parents.
How much is one beer?
Don't be so reserved.
He brought his lunch today.
My dream has come true.
Did you win the trophy?
Do you like dogs?
My sister always makes fun of me.
He erased his speech from the tape.
He has made me what I am.
I'm still not buying it.
Manuela's dresses are very elegant.
Why were you in prison?
Are you American?
That's why I sent for you.
Tom isn't your brother.
It's gotten better.
I'll come back on the tenth.
He's on his way.
You shouldn't ride a bicycle on the sidewalk.
Does this actually make you happy?
What time is dinner?
You're very nice.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
She advised him not to go there by himself.
We're all going.
Sometimes it's too late to apologize.
Her eyes filled with tears.
How old is this zoo?
The cat caught the mouse.
I had things to do.
The situation is grave.
I wanted to protect you.
Turn right at the second corner.
I do not doubt it in the least.
Which color do you like more, blue or red?
What languages do they speak in Belgium?
Nobody is too old to learn.
Leave it to me.
We understand.
Get out.
Tom slept without a pillow.
Take the garbage out.
The time will come when you will know the truth.
She did nothing but look around.
They agreed to give us an interview.
I had dinner ready for you.
That broken vase is my grandfather's.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I can't believe that didn't work.
You are the chosen one.
He landed himself a really plum job.
You look a lot like someone I used to know.
She laughed so hard she cried.
I don't want them to go away.
I had no doubts.
When should I return the car?
Why did you buy such an expensive dictionary?
It wasn't funny at all.
I'm glad to see you here.
I'm studying French.
The results are significant.
Tom handed an envelope to Mary.
He has an interesting book.
He met a nice young man.
I don't have much to lose.
It's a pity that you can't travel with us.
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
Do not touch the exhibits.
I can't believe you're still hungry.
I used to think no one cared.
Are you dating anybody?
You had better not do that.
I know what you were hoping for.
Isn't it your day off?
A fund was launched to set up a monument in memory of the dead man.
I got off lightly.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Boats were racing last night.
The whale shark is the largest shark in the world.
Tom could barely walk.
You're kind of cute.
Tom won't play tennis today.
He kept on reading the book.
I hope I'll see you again.
I can't see well.
He told me that Poe's novels were interesting.
The roof is made of thatch.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
Is it a boy or a girl?
How about going to see a movie tonight?
It doesn't look that way.
You're alone, aren't you?
There's no one left.
Tom bought a new tennis racket.
I spent ten dollars on a book.
Don't drink too much, okay?
I found the book boring.
I'd like to graduate next spring.
Am I clear?
It worked perfectly.
I will walk.
Try to improve your English.
I hardly ever run into him.
You pay for the convenience of living near a station.
I'd be delighted.
He doesn't want me to go, but I mean to.
What would I do if they really came?
My room is number five.
I want you to be my friend again.
If it rains, the game will be canceled.
I have until tomorrow to finish this.
I feel better today, but I am not well enough to work.
This table's surface is smooth.
Our teacher likes his new car.
Do you think it's wise to wear your uniform today?
She said that it might be true.
Do you want to see my translations?
I'm not tired yet.
Are you going to leave?
Finishing the report by tomorrow is next to impossible.
That's not my style.
All the parking spots were taken.
I usually shower at night.
Tom knows that won't work.
He drew some vertical lines on the paper.
What do you want me to do?
Tom's rather busy just now.
You got here fast.
You're so impatient with me.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
You cannot read this novel without crying.
I have lived in Tokyo since 1985.
She wanted to get married immediately.
We must do this right now.
He's fed up with socializing.
They love their children.
"Tom's crying." "I know."
I think it's time for me to start cooking dinner.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
Tom asked me if I would be home this evening.
Do you think you could make a little less noise?
In woodworking, we classify wood as hardwood, softwood or exotic wood.
She has a thing for older men.
Tom had blood on his shoes.
I do not like mathematics very much.
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
Would you please keep the noise down?
I turned off the lamp and went to sleep.
I miss my family and my country.
I suppose we have no choice.
You can easily judge the ripeness of a banana by the color of its peel.
He has gone to Hokkaido.
He played tennis.
Don't be so dramatic.
Everyone needs to do this.
Hold the ball with both hands.
I haven't been completely honest with you.
The water turned to ice.
Everyone would like to believe that dreams can come true.
He went there instead of me.
Tom is a real estate agent.
They can't push us around.
That made me very sad.
He remained steadfast to his principles.
I will take such action as seems necessary.
I had a busy afternoon.
When did you start wearing contacts?
We all want answers.
They are spraying the fruit trees.
That seems to make sense.
So, what do you mean?
Which air conditioner do you think is the most efficient?
Drop it!
He can't control himself.
I stopped drinking coffee.
I've always wanted to be a father.
This text is aimed at beginners.
Tom still isn't used to the way things work here.
What with good fortune, and his own effort, he won the first prize in the contest.
Does your wife know?
I don't know what to sing.
He's gone into hiding.
I like your hat.
I have so many ideas.
Before we say goodbye, there's something I'd like to ask you.
How do you plan to get home?
I'm reformed.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I can lend you one if you want.
They burned.
Show him how to do this.
Please look at these papers carefully.
Why do you laugh so hard at his jokes? They're not even funny.
She got caught.
Don't worry, I'm going to help you.
Why don't you join me?
I'll do everything I can.
Your dreams will come true.
I don't want to drink too much coffee.
I'm cracking up.
I ordered the book from Britain.
I'd like to file a complaint.
Japan has changed significantly in the past 50 years.
I gave you a book.

We must achieve our aim at any price.
I thought you were trying to be funny.
Did you hear it too?
My father is suffering from influenza.
They were scared to do it.
Most car accidents occur due to the inattention of the driver.
Look at it closely.

Get off my back!
I appreciate any assistance you can offer.
We're all on the same team.
What does it contain?
Are you certain about this?
I turned off the radio.
No one could find the answer.
I knew we forgot something.
You still have a lot to learn about women.
Some friends invited me to dinner.
Who doesn't think so?
I don't want to discuss it.
It's not right.
You don't even know who they are.
He made me sing on the stage.
Does she like chocolate?
I don't have to think about it.
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
He deprived my little sister of all her toys.
Do you feel lucky?
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
Why are you flinching?
Have you ever tried it?
To my surprise, he refused my offer.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
Hand me my mug.
Are you deaf?
Tom and Mary cut classes and went to the zoo.
How do you put up with all the noise?
His nose bled.
How do you know what I heard?
This one is a lot easier.
They launched a rocket.
I'm going crazy.
I never knew that.
It'll definitely rain.
She is angry with me.
Can I get your attention, please?
How good are you?
You're amazing.
That's all you get.
Tom shouldn't make fun of Mary.
I need your help.

Tom is kind of creepy.
Did you lose weight?
You were right, you know.
Is this a compliment?

I'm not denying that.
We all consider your idea to be impractical.
If you see a mistake, then please correct it.
Bad weather is no obstacle.
I was not studying then.

Why is my sister so mean to me?
A woman visited us while you were sleeping.
You must do it.
If I had bought the painting then, I would be rich now.
I hid behind a tree.
Do you need a hand with your suitcases?
We should deal with this matter without delay.
My mother is in the kitchen.
He would not raise my salary.
I don't think it would work as well as you might expect.
She first met him when they were students.
I found a good Mexican restaurant.
I bought you a present.
Einstein enjoyed playing the violin.
The day is almost over.
What happened to the others?
He met an unexpected obstacle.
This shirt needs to be washed.
Would you like one?
His parents loved me.
I don't know what you want me to say.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
I can't let you go in there alone.
How long are we supposed to keep this up?
My cat got stuck up a tree.
All took part in the negotiations.
Will we arrive on time?
I can't use it.
It was easy for him to solve the problem.
Many countries have problems with poverty.
You said that you loved Tom.
This book is of great use.
I had a good time last night.
I don't have anything to do right now.
Why is the train late?
They all laughed at their error.
He is a novelist and poet.
Tell me if it hurts.
We all suffered.
You got here late, didn't you?
This drives me nuts.
It doesn't matter how much it costs.
American women didn't have the right to vote.
Please hurry up!
Could you tell me how to get to Park Street?
Turn on the TV.
Do you think we'll have good weather?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Why don't we go and see a movie?
I'm going to hide somewhere near here.
He was groomed from a young age to take over the family business.
I'm ready to start.
She asked him out on a date.
This meat has gone bad.
I was born in Osaka, but brought up in Tokyo.
What do you like to do in your free time?
I haven't heard of it.
He was very puzzled.
We went into the red last year.
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
What's wrong with them?
I want to see your boss.
Tom is older than Mary.
No one is too old to learn.
Tom is Mary's husband's best friend.
Yesterday he came back late.
Go at once, otherwise you will be late.
I'm Tom's cousin.
Tom lost his ticket.
I am not the person I used to be.
Please stand face to face.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere before.
The paint hasn't dried yet.
I sat in the front of the bus.
The results for the English exam this time were very good.
Dogs are faithful animals.
It's not just about the money.
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor.
I had to abstain from smoking while I was in the hospital.
Tom seemed distracted.
He can no longer wait.
I have to speak with you immediately.
I might be a few minutes late.
I took care of it myself.
That's what I'm trying to do.
The boat drifted out to sea.
Just a second. This call might be important.
Her hobby is bodybuilding.
It's all in your head.
Wait a little longer.
Sometimes I get jealous.
I know I'm not a likable guy.
She persuaded him to marry her.
I just need you to trust me, OK?
I really don't feel like talking.
The doctor felt my pulse.
I can't figure this out.
She gave him a massage.
Do you have a question?
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
I have to admit I'm interested.
These trousers are dirty.
What should I eat for lunch today?
She advised him not to drink too much.
I have no idea what that guy is thinking.
I was just fooling around.
They renewed their vows on their 25th wedding anniversary.
Cut off the power.
Finally, I made up my mind and bought the new video game.
The stamp came off.
Do you have a family?
Apparently I'm adopted.
He shall die.
The report turned out to be false.
He said that he had told you to speak more slowly.
Right now I can't think of anything else.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I gave you explicit instructions not to touch anything.
How will we pay our debts now?
Mind your own business!
I think it's time for me to organize a party.
No one asked your opinion.
He was egging an innocent young man on to join him in his crooked deal.
Does this actually make you happy?
Tom can't swim very well yet.
I feel faint.
I'm not mean.
That's what I wrote.
I don't feel like working.
It's a luxury we can't afford.
Are you young?
I never actually studied French.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
I've got a touch of the flu.
Is this your bike?
I was skeptical.
I prepared breakfast for Tom.
I'll be praying for you.
Would you do that?
Her daughter has become a beautiful woman.
You're fair.
I'm powerless.
I feel funny today.
Do you really think we'll find Tom?
Don't you move or I'll shoot.
I think Tom has a plan.
Make it smaller.
I don't feel much like dancing.
She sent me a letter.
I never drink wine.
I have nothing particular to say.
It turned out not to be so easy to live with him.
He is not honest at all.
Get that thing off of me.
We were right.
Give me the keys to your car.
All I want to do is close my eyes and get some sleep.
She could not swim.
Don't lose your purse.
You look just fine.
I don't take it personally.
Tom still loves his job.
There's room inside.
I am sure of her success.
Don't you think I know my own father?
I take it for granted that you will join.
Do you enjoy talking?
Earthquakes destroy buildings.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
We're not prisoners.
I waited a whole year for that.
We'll all be together.
I messed up.
We're just like brothers.
The conclusion is crystal clear.
Don't fret.
Did you sleep well?
Will you please put the baby to bed?
Tom's cooking.
I thought it would be easy to do.
I was very busy yesterday.
Everybody started to leave.
Tom was really glad to hear that Mary was going to help him move.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Please come in.
The cup has a crack.
I really do hope that you'll do that without complaining.
I had a busy morning.
Fishing is prohibited here.
My grandmother has a green thumb.
How about going swimming?
I'm not inspired anymore.
I want you to go somewhere.
Are you saying my life is in danger?
If I had time, I'd accept his invitation.
She taught him how to play the piano.
You've seen enough.
Turn up the volume.
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
I don't think I realized how much I loved you.
There's a park near my house.
Could you leave us alone?
Some parents complained about the nude pictures in their children's textbooks.
I was frustrated.
Those pants are too big.
She was sore at me for being late.
I need something to write on.
It's a very difficult situation.
No one is perfect.
Will you read this cookbook?
How old are the children?
Stand where you are!
I can't be held responsible.
The witch hunt has begun.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
I'm not one of them.
That's true enough.
You're not asking me to give up, are you?
I tried to listen to him carefully.
I saw a stranger enter that house.
Of course!
I lost your number.
Have you ever scolded your daughter?
Nobody's going to rescue you.
When do we start?
Why don't you stay and drink some wine with us?
Act like a man.
Have a nice vacation.
I leave for London tomorrow morning.
Some children are swimming in the sea.
I paid to have this done.
Sorry, but I have to work tonight.
I can scarcely sleep at night.
Tom put on some clothes.
She prodded him to work harder.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
On behalf of the company, I welcome you.
He married my cousin.
All that has changed.
The post office is that brown building.
Is everyone hungry?
I saw you outside.
She acted as a guide.
I can't be without you.
He zones out in front of the TV for hours on end.
I'll certainly go and see him.
These cookies aren't expensive, but they taste good.
The store closes at seven.
Animals act on instinct.
She wrapped the present in paper.
What did you learn?
You're very intelligent.
How do you write your last name?
Do you know how many people in the world starve to death every year?
That's certainly possible.
I wonder why people always want to know the truth.
He is our teacher and a person we should respect.
I just want you to think about me once in a while.
I envy him.
Could you call me back later?
Tom pushed against the door with all his weight.
Please take your time before deciding what to do.
He has more money than he can spend.
We're not buying.
He knows quite well what it is like to be poor.
I was bitten in the leg by that dog.
You said you were going to handle it.
Cool it down.
I bet you're busy.
Tom brushed Mary's hair.
We're really angry.
She may not be aware of the danger.
Tom has Windows 7.
They have nothing to eat.
The botanist studied the flora of the remote island.
I've warned you before about this.
I'll be ready next time.
What a dope!
What is needed is more time.
I didn't want you involved in this.
Don't even joke about that.
You can't have the job.
The dog is theirs.
None of them wanted to talk.
Do you really want to put your life in her hands?
Who has taken my handbag?
How long will you be staying?
She's a very nice girl.
No one will speak with me.
Do you want to see her very much?
I was bored, so I wandered around town.
It was quiet all around.
Criminals should be punished.
Tom looks like a girl.
I have had to stay in bed for two days.
That's very considerate of you.
He has a sense of humor.
That was not my understanding.
Obesity is a national epidemic.
Tom still isn't quite convinced.
She avoided answering my questions.
Have you seen him before?
It matters.
He's my old drinking buddy.
Since you have nothing to do with this matter, you don't have to worry.
I don't know how you lasted five years in that job.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
Are you ready to go out?
There is honor even among thieves.
I figured you'd be impressed.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Who do you want to talk to?
Who are you and where do you come from?
I'll tell him that.
A sleeping child looks like an angel.
I found out something interesting today.
He has a good firm handshake.
Do you think there's something wrong with me?
The man is right.
Tom wouldn't really do that, would he?
I agree with your interpretation to a large extent.
You don't need to reinvent the wheel.
Someday you should give it a try.
It's terrible.
I have just arrived here.
She greets him every morning.
I get nervous when I speak before a large audience.
I don't know how deep the lake is.
She advised him to see the dentist, but he said that he didn't have enough time to do so.
This girl is driving me crazy.
Please sign this receipt.
I have to talk to somebody.
Fate taught me a hard lesson.
I'm so thirsty.
It's warm today so you can swim in the sea.
I took a bath.
Are you going to share that?
See what happens when you tell the truth?
Would you do something for me?
I kind of expected you to come alone.
A wise man would not say such a thing.
If my house were a mansion, I would invite everyone I know to my birthday party.
She is used to traveling.
They all looked happy.
Please check the attached file.
I corrected myself.
It's an old picture.
He is totally dependent on his parents.
When are you going to leave?
That's not really the point.
I need paint.
Tom doesn't think he could do that.
I will not be busy tomorrow.
I am ashamed of having been rude to her.
Who will play the role of the princess?
I have to say I envy you.
Everyone seeks happiness.
We went there for a week.
The following images are not for the faint of heart.
Did you kiss anybody?
It's worth a trip.
I've been following you.
That, of course, does not mean that they are right.
Get out of my bed.
You really don't have a clue, do you?
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
Tom was in no mood to talk to Mary.
Was your family with you last month?
Why don't you trust me?
I have a good sense of smell.
We should do that again.
Who else is with you?
Somebody is playing the piano.
Tom was surprised by Mary's reaction.
Let's chat.
You need to be prepared.
When did you come?
We become forgetful as we grow older.
Everyone started talking at once.
Are you sure he can do this?
I moved here yesterday.
You gotta get more organized.
It is necessary to prepare for the worst.
I'm having lunch with my sister right now.
Few students understand Latin.
I had a dog named Cookie.
I wish you happiness.
This may just come in handy someday.
I called in sick this morning.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
He hugged her.
They're not coming.
This is for my friend.
Rice is the chief crop in this area.
I can see myself in the mirror.
You're nice.
That's what I thought you meant.
He was a rugby player.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
See you soon!
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
This screw is loose.
Have you ever been to France?
That is the exactly the same idea as I have.
Tom has a mustache.
She asked me how old I was.
I'd like to get started.
I change my mind a lot.
It will take a little time to get used to wearing a wig.
I think we need to be very careful not to hurt Tom's feelings.
Most Americans are descended from immigrants.
His theory is difficult to understand.
Hold on firmly to the handrail.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
He had an interview with the Prime Minister.
I don't think she takes after her mother.
I'm not particularly impressed.
If Tom ate more vegetables, he'd probably be healthier.
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
They fled in all directions.
The most amazing thing happened yesterday.
I don't feel like playing.
We watch television every evening.
I felt scared.
She hired him as a programmer.
You should've said so earlier.
I took care of my sick sister.
I was puzzled about what to do next.
I'm going to cook you a nice dinner.
Tom started loading the gun.
I am weak.
How dangerous is the situation?
Give me the car keys.
Not everything is black and white.
Someone should put that dog out of its misery.
I've never seen such a large whale.
I don't feel like going out tonight.
I live in the house.
People learn from experience.
Did you hurt yourself?
Twelve divided by three is four.
Many people like to travel.
I regret to inform you that your application has been refused.
They were only interested in selling books.
Have you already finished?
Are you happy right now?
What will become of the child?
He died yesterday.
I have something I have to do.
His success delighted his parents.
He will be busy tomorrow.
I know you've got a gun.
Classes begin at 8 o'clock.
I don't know what's happened.
Tom thought you were drunk.
Please don't leave me here by myself.
We don't want anyone asking questions.
They were better than I expected.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
He wrote down all the details.
Thanks to you, I arrived on time.
They forced him to tell the truth.
What'll we do if Tom is late?
That's our fault.
I already feel much better.
It seems that Tom isn't here today.
In an emergency, do you act quickly?
Look out the window.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't speak French.
He brought us sad news.
They were worried about getting caught.
He knows every inch of this area.
I think I'll go skiing.
He selected a Christmas gift for her.
I think this is the most impressive building on Park Street.
It's your duty to finish the job.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Is anyone listening?
I'm lucky to have a job.
They have twin daughters.
Please pull the rope.
If you can't beat them, join them.
The whale is the largest animal on the earth.
She advised him to take better care of himself.
She divorced him after many years of unhappiness.
She died of cancer.
I'm glad to see you again.
We have a decision to make.
I just brewed a pot.
I am familiar with this part of town.
The Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in 1957.
Do you think English is difficult?
I just want them both to be happy.
I will choose one of them.
I never thought I'd get that lucky.
I was taken by surprise.
I love the taste of mushrooms.
I'm outraged.
I don't know how to contact you.
I wish you good luck.
I frequently recall my happy childhood.
Just tell me the truth. I promise I won't get mad.
My children won't listen to me.
Tom never came out of his coma.
They are in the same class.
Are you about done?
Please take me home.
Everybody says that he's an effeminate guy.
I broke it.
We can both do it.
That wasn't what Tom meant.
All I can do is to do my best.
I just feel awful.
This photo is too blurry. I can't make out your face.
They de-iced the bridge with salt.
I have a slight cold.
I need a knife.
We don't get many visitors here.
I'd love to be able to spend less time doing household chores.
Democracy is an idea that goes back to the ancient Greeks.
You're out of touch with reality.
He's a famous artist.
I'm going to prepare for the final exams this afternoon.
I seem to have the wrong number.
It's a pity when somebody dies.
I took it for granted that you would come.
I saw him go into the toilet a few minutes ago.
We were surprised by his behavior.
I want to know what's going on out there.
How long have you been out of prison?
I thought I recognized you.
My boyfriend is not a loser.
You may go there.
They enjoyed themselves.
Are you registered?
Tom is probably at home now.
Would you ever go skinny dipping?
It's clear that you're wrong.
I'm still not satisfied.
It is bold of you to say such a thing.
I hope you're having fun.
Where's everyone going?
He doesn't have to know.
I had my thumbnail torn off.
You're too naive.
I made a model plane.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
I sometimes watch TV.
It's the only thing I can think of.
Many stores offer discounts in the month of August.
He drinks himself unconscious every night.
You must take care of yourself.
You can't be in two places at once.
I thought we had found the perfect hiding place, but the police found us.
Printing ink is in short supply.
I have something to trade.
He had a second helping of soup.
Why don't you say something?
Tom turned off the engine and shut off the headlights.
Are we lost?
Would you like it washed?
That actress is as beautiful as ever.
What was it?
The joke's on us.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
He tossed and turned all night.
Is that enough for you, Tom?
I'm no better at cooking than my mother.
He wrote a lot of stories.
I'm about ready.
I want you to handle it.
May I take a picture of you?
I spent twelve hours on the train.
There are many different ways of doing this.
How's your project coming along?
I didn't know what it was at the time.
Tom is a very strange person.
I want you to go upstairs.
The more guests there are, the more difficult it is to keep a surprise party secret.
Don't let that happen again!
Could you speak as slowly as possible?
"Will he recover soon?" "I hope so."
I've heard that song before.
Any time will suit me.
Tom rinsed his mouth.
What's the weather forecast for tomorrow?
I have plans.
I want justice.
He's attracted to Asian girls.
Please water the flowers.
You are a troublemaker.
Don't back away.
He was not a good speaker.
Tom escaped from his cell.
I suggest we get moving.
Wake up!
I recorded our conversation.
You've made no allowance for the fact that he is young.
I think he's right.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
He says he's got to get to Vienna the day after tomorrow.
He doesn't know English.
Are you the girl Tom has been hanging out with?
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
I'm not married yet.
Do you want to use mine?
He was ashamed of the grades he got.
I don't see how that is any of your business.
Loosen up.
He likes to live in Tokyo.
Our committee consists of ten members.
The truck cut in front of my car.
It's your duty to finish the job.
We have to be cautious.
I think you might have a drinking problem.
You've been there before, haven't you?
I told myself to stay positive.
He doesn't eat this, does he?
I wanted to read a book.
I require your advice.
I think everybody's hungry.
Here are the tickets.
She wasn't able to talk to him.
Tom is an excellent lawyer.
The ice melted.
We have until October to complete our plan.
It is difficult for foreign students to speak English well.
You don't have to go unless you want to.
Go when you want.
I'm always careful.
That's embarrassing.
He acted like he owned the place.
Bear in mind that, under such circumstances, we have no alternative but to find another buyer.
I forgot to ask your name.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
You should stay at home today.
I come here every Monday.
I doubt that our new boss will be any worse than the old one.
I know what he's thinking.
She bought her son a camera.
Try to find out if everything he said is true.
Did you mention my book?
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Would you mind carrying it up the stairs for me?
I hate Mary's boyfriend.
He's an Englishman.
Breakfast is ready.
What browser are you using?
What was the outcome?
People were lined up around the block waiting for the theater to open.
He is more clever than me.
She attempted to persuade her father.
You're not as good as you think you are.
He saved a sailor.
I had something else on my mind.
I can't take that chance.
I suppose I could change a tire if I had to.
I want you to listen to this song.
What language were they speaking?
He attended the meeting as our company representative.
I like your earrings.
Why did you say such a thing?
We're just not used to it yet.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Our school is 80 years old.
He was silent for what seemed to me an hour.
Let them take care of themselves.
Don't be so negative.
Running away isn't the answer.
That job is impossible for me to do.
I thought we had found the perfect hiding place, but the police found us.
You need a drink.
I've decided never to vote again.
How often should I feed my dog?
We can't do this without you.
You're very nice.
What is this?
We found a secret door into the building.
I am tired of my monotonous life.
Let's go, Tom.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.
Can't you discount it a little?
I don't know what's happening.
She should have been more careful.
I bought this TV from Tom.
Please complete your homework.
We're stuffed.
Please turn off the radio.
Your name is familiar to me.
Tom didn't get married until he was thirty.
I have to stop.
He is the last man I want to see.
All of my children live in Boston.
You should be more reasonable.
I can't imagine living like that.
Please write your name with a pencil.
He lives here all alone.
Tell Tom I'm not home.
I've asked you this question before.
She accompanied him to Japan.
I still say we should've helped Tom.
I'm going to figure this out.
We got stuck in traffic.
Can anyone answer my question?
Frankly speaking, he's wrong.
Tom left everything to me.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
It's awful.
Here we are!
The most valuable skill one can acquire is the ability to think for oneself.
I paid for these tickets.
Did you hear what Tom said?
Thanks for the info.
Do your homework by yourself.
We don't have a garden.
They danced all night long.
You're not bruised.
Don't stand near me.
I think, without a doubt, that I'll win the tennis match.
You need to look at the big picture here.
Could you stop, please?
I was impressed with her work.
Please sing.
Does it offend you?
I will go on foot.
Please refrain from smoking here.
I thought you'd be here.
Let's get the party started.
It is believed that whales have their own language.
The strike affected the nation's economy.
I'll pass.
Who left the window open?
Did your uncle let you drive his car?
My father is sweeping the garage.
He went to America to study American literature.
She had the box carried downstairs.
I just had to see you guys before I left.
What if someone killed Tom? What would you do?
We're claustrophobic.
He lied to me.
Tom offered Mary a slice of cake.
He is a daredevil.
I enjoy music.
This movie is incredibly stupid.
They trusted you.
I will gladly help you.
The new boy had a nervous stammer.
I think you should go.
Can I tell you what bugs me?
Your wish will come true in the near future.
Can you give me a discount?
This list is not official.
She is afraid of cats.
I can't draw a bird.
I think of you as a friend.
I'm not persuaded.
Can you tell me which button to press?
I'm happy, too.
Can you believe it?
He got angry.
I don't mind helping you clean up after the party.
Tom and Mary aren't coming.
That'll put you in danger.
He is a great scientist.
Please do not kill me.
Let's call the whole thing off.
I want you to talk to me.
We elected her captain of our team.
I'm about the same age as you.
After a hectic few days at work, Tom is looking forward to a change of pace.
The government collapsed after a vote in parliament.
I knew I'd seen it before.
He took charge of the expenses.
I like to write poems.
I'm smarter than you.
I want to show you what Tom gave me.
You're overemotional.
That's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it.
While there is life, there is hope.
You never cease to amaze me.
I weighed myself on the bathroom scales.
You're adorable.
You'll need some of these.
Tom can't buy himself a car.
I said it as a joke.
Tom pressed the intercom button.
See if my answer is correct.
I hope he's all right.
I heard her speaking English as fluently as an American.
Who's winning?
I remember many things.
You will be all right again in a couple of days.
You can't live like this.
What you're doing makes me nervous.
I loved you.
I know you've been trying to help.
She advised him to take a rest.
I know you're upset.
I wish I could go with you, but as it is, I can't.
He was angry because I wouldn't give him any help.
Did I give it to you?
I didn't make any promises.
So, what do you mean?
I think I'd better stay here.
Who caused the accident?
He set his house on fire.
Are you sure about that?
I knew you'd mess things up.
You're not supposed to be in here.
You never cease to surprise me.
I sacrificed everything.
She admits knowing the secret.
I can't let you in there.
The word is on the tip of my tongue.
What did you expect to happen?
I'll trust you.
Who else do you miss?
I was bored to death.
You aren't as short as I am.
Did anyone hear me?
This book goes on the top shelf.
Look carefully. I'm going to show you how it's done.
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
Don't make fun of old people.
I told you not to talk about the matter in her presence.
He's rich.
We already gave it to you.
I remember seeing this before.
His sons do as they please.
I caught a cold.
I'll buy you a beer.
She baked bread and cakes in the oven.
You and I have something in common.
We must follow the regulations.
I lost the camera I had bought the day before.
The house is going to feel empty without you.
Wonderful!
It's impossible.
The moon is already out.
I try to travel with only one suitcase.
I have homework.
You made my day.
I met them.
I hope it wasn't too boring.
I've been trying to make an effort to come here more often.
You'd better try something else.
Will you watch the Olympics?
You're not a millionaire.
I appreciate what you did today.
He was nearly run over at an intersection.
Don't pry into my private life.
Are you up for it?
She knows everything about cooking.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
What would life be without hope?
Where do you get your ideas from?
I watched a movie on video.
What do you usually have for breakfast?
There is an urgent need for new ideas.
Man eats to live, he does not live to eat.
I think I know why you're here.
You should have taken a chance then.
I didn't realize you were Canadian.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
What a lucky person he is!
She attacked him.
You're just the man I want to see.
You shouldn't depend too much on other people to help you.
I promise you I'll look after you.
Let me grab my bag.
I want to be there, you know.
Something weird's going on here.
I've got to get dressed for school.
What time shall I pick you up?
Have you ever thought about becoming a teacher?
Let's not go.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
I remember saying that.
I haven't eaten for many days.
We spoke briefly.
I could feel the sweat trickling down my back.
How long have you known her?
Don't be such a fool.
We were busy.
Don't you want to say anything?
I think I'd like to be your friend.
I made friends with them at the school festival.
Thank you for your letter.
I still need to use these things, so please don't take them away.
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
How many suicides do you think there are every year in Japan?
Come and see me any time you like.
I don't mind being criticized when I am wrong.
When did you come back from Germany?
This is outlandish.
Tom went fishing.
You might meet him.
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
That looks like fun.
We had fun, didn't we?
I need air.
All of us were excited with the result of the experiment.
You sort of hinted that you wanted me to ask you out.
You're very rude.
Birds build nests.
Tom certainly deserves praise.
Get out of my sight.
Marriage customs differ by country.
What color did Tom dye his hair?
I need glue.
What is the next stop?
He hung his jacket on a hook.
Everyone likes you.
The new boss runs a really tight ship.
This apple is sour.
It's just money.
I like your tie.
Can anyone help me?
Muslims always pray facing toward Mecca.
I had my hat blown off by the wind.
It isn't impossible.
Wait until you see this.
My father banks part of his salary every week.
Please tell me the reason why she got angry.
How did I get into this?
His eyes are blue.
I want you to explain it to me in more detail.
Is that right?
Their son grew bigger.
They painted their house bright yellow.
You have too many irons in the fire.
Now it's time to say good night.
I don't like being treated like a child.
No one could deny this.
Please choose wisely.
We're touched.
I'd like a word with you in private.
Tom was the one who taught me how to sing country music.
I want a room with two beds.
I have to open my shop.
I was kept waiting nearly half an hour.
My father is out.
This water is a little salty.
I'll say it one more time.
They have plenty of water.
No problem.
I'll arrange that for you.
I appreciate any assistance you can offer.
It was too long.
There is nothing God cannot do.
This is just a symptom of a much bigger problem.
I'm very glad to see you again.
You don't have to hide your feelings.
I like the way you treat me.
Teenagers love playing video games.
Do you think he is a good driver?
You're rich.
Wait one second.
She calmed down.
She lived all her life in that town.
She lives in this neighborhood.
Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?
My father does not like music.
Why did Tom want to talk to Mary?
Please don't laugh at me.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
Nothing is more disappointing than to lose in the finals.
I just wanted to see what it was like.
It's time to eat lunch.
Well, have you decided?
She is skipping rope.
I'm stuffed.
I've just been to the bank.
Would you like me to tell the truth?
We respect them.
I'm lying on the grass.
I thought Tom was sick.
He said he was poor.
I lit the match.
He called off the trip.
Do you have enough energy?
I love it.
Did I wake you up?
Do you like music?
Life without love is meaningless.
No one knew who did it.
This is something to consider.
Let's take a rest here.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Don't make me come back here.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Speak a little louder.
The cat is safe.
Tom is pretty decisive.
I'm happy you liked it.
I lost a bunch of keys.
We all change.
A child is crying somewhere.
You can't put two saddles on the same horse.
I can't believe you're really here.
I want you to want me.
Do you trust me?
Why are we here?
Strictly speaking, the tomato is a fruit.
I made a snowman.
It's a necessary piece of equipment.
What a wonderful idea!
It would be nice if you helped me a little.
Tom ate quickly.
I managed to make myself understood in English.
I've learned to think like Tom thinks.
I cannot afford long vacations.
You have no alternative.
He confirmed that something was wrong with his car.
I'm going to kill him for this!
This stuff tastes awful.
I'm really shocked.
She might know the answer.
We're smart.
The length of this ship is 30 meters.
Who are you and what do you want?
They grow strawberries in their greenhouse.
You need to grow up.
I don't know what else we can do.
I like both watching and playing sports.
It's raining everywhere.
I remember reading about it.
Please give me your permanent address.
They found out.
I didn't really think it would happen.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
What's your favorite non-alcoholic beverage?
I gather you were unsuccessful.
He was born on July 28th, 1888.
I think Tom could be sick.
Many people will lose their jobs due to the slump in the auto industry.
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
The food at that restaurant is too greasy for me.
I think it's very impressive.
Do you still want to go to the lighthouse?
I ran away.
Why is this light blinking?
His success was nothing short of a miracle.
I am taking a couple of days off.
I'll do anything but that job.
Do you have a cellphone?
He admonished his son for being lazy.
They're surprised.
Her silence surprised me.
Is there anything you want to add?
My mother gets up earlier than I do.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
You'll be dead someday.
Do you know what happened?
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
I didn't know you still had friends at the IRS.
They're not bad.
She is the one you should model yourself after.
Tom had expected something quite different.
Would you sing us a song in English?
That's fantastic.
I owe you a lunch.
Don't you ever come back.
You came at five.
Tom has two brothers who live in Boston.
You may swim.
Tom has great wealth, but he is not happy.
He is likely to win the game.
Are there any liquids or sharp objects in your luggage?
I don't want to see you.
I need more information on this matter.
Adjust the microscope's focus.
I'm reliable.
Who is it?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
He turned off the light.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive.
Tom wanted to make more money.
You must make allowance for his lack of experience.
I want to catch the 11:45.
You must not yield to temptation.
Lesson Two is easy.
He denied it.
I was more than a little shocked by this.
How do you define success?
Would you like to switch seats?
Someone must have left it there.
I'm happy enough.
I cannot entertain such a request.
I was never so humiliated in my life.
I remember seeing her before.
Take a look at this report.
It would be better if you didn't drink so much coffee late at night.
I'm staying with you.
Do you know her at all?
All lawyers are liars.
I couldn't get the point of his speech.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
I can't stop myself.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
I didn't believe him at first.
It came as a surprise.
I figured you might need some help.
It was very ugly.
They wanted to steal the car.
He got up earlier than usual.
She allegedly killed him in self defense.
I made the deal.
When's this supposed to happen?
I want to do this alone.
He ran his fingers through her hair.
Tom went that way.
I broke my fingernail.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
Tom killed Mary because he found out she had started the fire that had killed his family.
Are you envious?
Be quiet while I am speaking.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
You may think your comment was innocuous, but I found it very offensive.
You're disloyal.
The boy didn't change his opinion.
Was Tom asked to leave?
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
There are a lot of places to see around here.
There are a lot of dogs here, aren't there?
We'll see what the judge has to say about that.
Of the 23 who were arrested, four escaped.
He is always on time for an appointment.
My teeth are totally healthy and free of problems.
I want to know more about the accident that killed Tom.
It was not long before we met again by chance.
I don't need your money.
She lost her memory in a traffic accident.
I thought you were taller.
He took my umbrella without bothering to ask.
He makes the most of his opportunities.
I don't think your seeing him is good for you.
It's OK to be scared, Tom.
Where are you headed?
I think that's an exaggeration.
It's stealing.
Let me answer Tom's question.
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
You don't seem very sure.
What's your favorite pizza topping?
Where is today's paper?
I'm a salesperson.
Do you like apples?
Would it be all right if I visited you today?
I don't know which to choose.
Tom doesn't know if Mary is dead or alive.
Madrid is the capital of Spain.
Mary is helping her mother.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Have you decided?
Tom was right after all.
Don't wait.
We have to be prepared to cope with violent storms.
They abandoned the sinking ship.
Do you want to become a father?
This is how I made it.
She advised him to see a lawyer.
May I take pictures here?
He was playing tennis all day.
Did anybody see what happened?
When do you mean to start?
Tom's shoes are too small for him.
She asked him where he lived, but he was too smart to tell her.
All the stores are closed.
It's worth a try, right?
Can you supply me with everything I need?
You will not be able to go through the book so quickly.
Only 16 percent of the teachers of this school are female.
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
She became drowsy after supper.
What did you get hit with?
I'm sorry, my father is out.
What a pity you can't dance!
Is Okayama a big city?
Who's your favorite movie director?
I've been trying to get your attention.
He must be over fifty.
Isn't that what we were supposed to do?
Is Tom staying at the Hilton Hotel?
This is new.
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
My parents will be home about 2:30.
Winter has gone. Spring has come.
I'm not going to get involved.
Never rub your eyes after cutting a hot pepper.
I came here to study.
I hate myself for not having the will power to quit eating junk food.
We saw her when leaving the house.
We went on foot.
The negotiations have ended.
He prefers poetry to fiction.
I'd like to check your blood pressure.
This is nonsense.
He heard footsteps.
You need to be more patient.
It is under the chair.
I hate Sundays.
You aren't my mother.
Look out for pedestrians when you drive a car.
Can you make it safe?
Can all birds fly?
We elected him president.
Why did you buy the flowers?
I'm watching the Olympics.
I think everyone looks back on their childhood with some regret.
She burst into tears.
I know what you mean.
You shouldn't trust Tom.
Would you like to hear me sing a song?
Can we get to the moon in the near future?
Nobody will help you.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
I understand your position perfectly.
That's my business.
Have you given Tom the key?
She gave him the brush off.
We'll attend.
You're impressed, aren't you?
Have you ever tried it?
They all drank.
I would rather you came tomorrow than today.
I must work tonight.
I paid attention.
I'm playing with my friends.
What fruit do you like the best?
Pass me the salt, will you?
You must repay your debts.
Tell me you're kidding.
The couple next door are fighting again.
What are some foods you usually eat with your fingers?
I know better than to lend him money.
He is off duty today.
He is engaged to my younger sister.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
There were enough.
What else would you like to eat?
I have enjoyed myself very much.
Would you please lock the door?
We are having a serious talk about your future.
A strange thing happened last night.
The audience consisted mainly of students.
I should've known this.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I've completely forgotten his name.
They've all gone crazy.
Ask Tom.
Sleep tight.
Tom has a soft voice.
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
What's his first name?
Do you like it all?
He nearly got away with it.
Life is short.
She decided to study abroad.
The gifts will delight the children.
I wonder if there's a connection.
The neighbors called the police.
Do you think I can pull this off?
We are going to the shop.
I wonder if you ever think of me.
I want you to tell Tom that I love him.
I don't have anything to give to you.
I just feel a little dizzy.
Do you wear glasses?
People have the right to defend themselves.
You did not answer my question.
Tom insisted that I go.
Tom and I will help you.
I was tired from doing my homework.
Here comes the waiter.
We must hurry if we want to arrive at the station on time.
I really wish I could be there with you.
Probably you are allergic to pollen or dust.
Please help me.
Arithmetic deals with numbers.
She worked hard.
Tell me what I did wrong.
Tom is an avid cyclist.
I would rather die than do it.
I beg of you to listen carefully.
I know some students in that school.
Would you like to have tea with us this afternoon?
There were soldiers on these ships.
If you ever come to town, come to see me.
Tom doesn't like Mary's living there alone.
He attained his goal.
There wasn't any special hurry.
I'll show you how to do it.
I stayed up till late at night.
I may have something for you.
It looked real.
She became rich by virtue of hard work and good business sense.
It is pretty cold today.
Do you know the man who's staring at you?
This doesn't fit.
I think you know everyone here.
That's not something I want to do.
What will we eat?
We should sometimes pause to think.
Tom says he can make a decent living as a sidewalk musician.
Who is playing the piano in the living room?
I did it once.
Come back.
I don't know where I should look.
I've never lied to you.
His wife is worn out after looking after the children.
It's a dangerous world.
If it had not been for your advice, I could not have succeeded.
You look contented.
Do you have a passport?
He is a handsome man.
Can I take that as a compliment?
He lives off the grid.
I bought the book.
Mary doesn't usually wear jewelry.
Everything went horribly wrong.
It may well be that you're right.
I know the feeling.
I'm sleeping.
How do you help someone who doesn't want your help?
That was ours.
Roll down your window.
There's nothing I can do about it.
What crimes have you committed?
They look just like rats leaving a sinking ship.
I meet him at the club.
What's the date today?
Can you prove that what you said is true?
Is there something I can do for you?
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker.
It would cost twice as much as that.
He complained about the noise.
I had my hat blown off.
Do you want to come in?
You promised me you'd look after Tom.
Can I speak to the head nurse?
I asked Tom if he knew anybody who taught French.
I knew I'd get blamed eventually.
I have faith in your ability to do the right thing.
Be kind to the children.
America did away with slavery.
I'm here to listen.
As he grew older, he became more obstinate.
I know a better way to do that.
You don't belong here.
We can win.
Today, I got up very early.
Drive carefully.
That's a man's job.
You've been very helpful.
I just don't understand it.
I hope this fine weather holds.
I had to catch the first train this morning in order to get here in time.
Did you have fun last night?
This sounds very interesting.
You look fabulous.
She asked after her friend.
He suddenly fell ill.
I'm lucky to have a job.
The old man spent most of his time looking back on his youth.
Is it hot over there?
She tempted him.
I had never seen a more beautiful sight.
Tom always treats me like a child.
You're not helping much.
Tom didn't trust Mary.
It's ideal weather for a picnic.
This river is beautiful.
You can depend on it.
Money has changed his life.
Tom doesn't even let his daughter go out on weekends.
Paris is one of the largest cities in the world.
I will wait.
He let me go.
I phoned.
You're off the hook.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
She explained to him why she didn't like his parents.
I suppose I could change a tire if I had to.
He said he would write to me, but he hasn't.
No one knows me like you do.
Please step aside.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like going out today.
Is this pencil yours?
He's afraid of making mistakes.
The time bomb exploded with a loud noise.
He probably won't become famous.
What do you think he did?
You can not miss it.
It's a bit greasy.
You look very tired.
I have no time.
Can we have a moment alone?
Don't be so impatient.
He wants to squish the bug.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
She was swimming.
They just want someone they can blame.
You won't believe who sat down next to me.
Tom is afraid of you.
I can't tell you what Tom told me.
Let me do my job.
The desk is covered with dust.
Who is going to speak tonight?
She loves shopping.
I didn't mean to hit him.
He likes vegetables, especially cabbage.
Are you going to sing here?
I'm studying kabuki drama.
They ate and drank wine.
Is that all right with you?
You're very rude.
Did they say how?
I have already done my homework.
She didn't say a word to me all night.
Every time I read this book, I discover something new.
It's not really that relaxing.
Your father got a promotion.
Don't spoil the mood.
Have you tried that before?
May I have a timetable?
Is he still here?
Tom was ambitious.
What is a UFO?
We're almost like brothers.
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
He tied the dog to a tree.
Do you think we should just wait and hope it changes?
My hobby is collecting old coins.
I've lost all my money.
He threw a stone at the big dog.
Do you know that guy?
He smiled and left.
I was really worried about you.
I need a little more space.
His words are meaningless.
Some people are never content with what they have.
He likes coffee without sugar.
I must renew my passport.
It looks like you had a tough day.
Can you stay for a while?
Tom is too young to go to school.
We are accustomed to wearing shoes.
Will you show me the picture?
You're so sweet.
It began to rain before I got home.
Is she at home?
It is up to you to decide what to do.
Don't believe anything he says.
Have I caught you at a bad time?
How much are the pears?
This should be fun.
Take an umbrella. It's likely to rain.
I shouldn't have put my laptop so close to the edge of the table.
Put some water into the vase.
I'm being serious.
I like to invent useful things.
I bought a new handbag.
That was a close one.
Does that make you sad?
Who picked you for this job?
The bus is full. You'll have to wait for the next one.
It works.
She shook her head.
His mother sighed with relief.
He went surfing.
He is too shy to talk to girls.
Tom looks disgusted.
You're the teacher.
Computers are capable of doing extremely complicated work.
I gave Tom detailed instructions.
Don't move till I get back.
Tom put the coins into the box.
Is this seat free?
We're no longer working for Tom.
You're just not the person I thought you were.
I like what I do.
Are you sure you just want water?
I informed her of my departure.
Her blue shoes go well with that dress.
I can't talk to girls.
When will he go home?
That's reversing the logical order of things.
He is a good carpenter.
The hero died at the end of the book.
The spy made contact with the enemy.
We are influenced by our environment.
How much does this cost?
You screwed up.
I will do whatever you ask.
She read the poem out loud.
I wasn't asleep.
He went above and beyond the call of duty.
It is necessary for you to go.
He is always full of ideas.
You can't buy anything interesting in this store.
Why don't you remember?
Did Tom stay?
I love you a lot.
Marimbas are made from rosewood.
They lived on farms or in small towns.
Don't forget to spend a little time looking over your notes before the exam.
When was the last time you bought shoes?
I'll provide you with all the necessary information.
They're amazing.
It doesn't matter who pitches, that team always loses.
Do you have an opinion?
It makes no sense whatsoever.
Do you think it works?
She climbed down from the roof.
It's worth a try.
Before I get out of bed, I spend a little time thinking about what I'll be doing the rest of the day.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
We walked more quickly than usual.
She was obliged to marry the old man.
The war between France and England lasted one hundred years.
Watch out for that man.
Tom doesn't know what this is. Do you?
I know how busy you've been.
I will stay here for a short period.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
This knife doesn't cut well.
Are you still not convinced?
Are you satisfied or dissatisfied?
I forgot to tell you when to come.
You're cheating.
Can you give me a slice of bread?
I don't have to listen to that.
Where's convenient for you?
She agreed with him that I should go to the meeting.
Look at that big hammer.
I really have to go.
It never occurred to him that she would get angry.
Tom forced himself to speak.
Don't you always do what's expected?
We shouldn't judge people based on their appearance.
He said he would call tomorrow.
Shut that boy up.
I'm pretty happy.
Such a proposal would only be turned down immediately.
I felt quite relieved after I had said all I wanted to say.
She agreed with him on what to do with the old car.
What kind of shampoo do you use?
I feel all right.
I want to drink.
Have you seen Tom lately?
You never know for sure.
Are you sick?
Life is really tough sometimes.
She was very rude to him.
I'm a social worker.
He makes the most of his opportunities.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Has your dog ever bitten you?
I made dinner.
She gave me a meaningful look.
He is clumsy with his hands.
Nobody thinks this is a joke.
They refused to help us.
Leave us alone.
How did you get acquainted with her?
We need to burn all these leaves.
They were afraid of you.
Hurry up, and you will be able to catch the train.
Could you come back a little later?
Like father, like son.
I'm not kidding.
I completely forgot.
It costs around thirty Euros.
I was planning on going to the beach today, but then it started to rain.
That's not my signature.
Put some clothes on.
Let me tell you about our special.
All of you speak French, right?
After I got married, my Japanese got better and I could understand more.
You can't miss it.
I'd be happy to help.
She advised him to lose weight.
Tom wouldn't say yes.
I'm pretty sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
That swimsuit looks really good on you.
That's what I want most of all.
They got married.
Is he breathing?
I think the time is right to introduce this product.
It is time to go to school.
I met him once when I was a student.
This park reminds me of my childhood.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
Employees are prohibited from watching the Olympics.
Many trees are bare in winter.
School bores me.
I'm dying for a beer!
I'm homeschooled.
I'll be late.
I like swimming, but I don't like to swim here.
I am on holiday this week.
Would you like to drink anything?
You're wasting your time.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
She's very interested in music.
I was blinded by the light.
I gave you fair warning.
Is her hair naturally red?
I caught a carp in a net.
Stop reading.
Tom doesn't understand Mary's reluctance to go out with his brother.
You must do exactly as I tell you.
Are we alone?
That's hers.
I don't deserve to be this happy.
The economic situation grew worse.
You have to leave.
Men differ from other animals in that they can think and speak.
I saw a dog swim across the river.
What are the terms of the contract?
It's the largest in the world.
Stop! You're making him cry.
We had a little water.
I really appreciate your coming.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I felt out of place in the expensive restaurant.
It's easier to have fun than to work.
Get down from there.
It is difficult to translate a poem into another language.
We may still get lucky.
That's stupid.
I'm very impressed.
You must come with me.
Did she say that?
Tom likes all vegetables except cabbage.
He had never seen such a bad boy.
Whatever happens, you must keep calm.
There's no way I'm going to work on Sunday.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
I think you need a vacation.
What is it really about?
You're the same age as my girlfriend.
I'm really bad with names, but I never forget a face.
Is there anything I can do?
You were hurt, weren't you?
I still make mistakes.
The country is heading in the right direction.
He made his son a wealthy man.
They're not evil.
It ain't like before, you know.
He is giving me a hard time.
She left France for America.
I can't protect you.
I wonder what raccoons eat.
We have to find a way to get that done.
I owe you a lot.
Is that genuine?
Is this 223-1374?
This is truly amazing.
This company is indifferent to the safety of its workers.
You are an idiot to go out in this weather.
Since he was tired, he was sitting on the sofa with his eyes closed.
I'll be leaving now.
I don't know what to do here.
I have a job for you.
I'm pleased with their performance.
Tom is swimming in the river.
I hate long flights.
You're not that smart.
Wear whatever you want.
You aren't invited.
Be careful or you'll strip the gears.
Many people pushed their way toward the rear exit.
Tom is falling asleep.
You won't be fired.
I want that bag.
Haste makes waste.
I have never seen anyone like him.
Everything was wrong.
You're the teacher.
I've never seen so many birds at one time before.
He was sleeping under the tree.
I'm beginning to smell a rat.
He was embarrassed.
I ate lunch at around eleven because I was hungry
I made two.
He was raised in the United States, but his native language is Japanese.
She felt a bit tired.
I'm giving you what you want.
I like wearing old clothes.
Tom is one of Mary's childhood friends.
That kid's a chip off the old block.
The hills were covered with snow.
That's just what you needed.
Did you win the case?
It was a relief.
A map is available upon request.
Look at those fish in the pond.
Don't be too hard on me.
Some things can't be forgotten.
I've been a little sick lately.
Leave me a message, please.
It's a beautiful night for a swim, don't you think?
Which team will win the game?
We sat on a bench in the park.
My sister has her hair done each week.
I don't feel very happy.
I feel very lonely these days.
Tom clearly doesn't understand French very well.
I am growing to hate the girl.
Why did it have to be us?
He greeted his parents.
I cut class.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I thought it must be something like that.
Tom is your age.
How is your family name written?
I want to take another look around.
My brother's going to kill me.
Brush your teeth.
I have another good idea.
Something went wrong with my watch.
Tom burned all of the letters that Mary had sent him.
How much are you being paid to do this?
Don't wait up for me.
We decorated the room ourselves.
I understand your dilemma.
I ran the risk of losing my job to help her.
They agreed on everything.
Change trains at Chicago for New York.
Maybe you're right.
Put it where you like.
The trip will take at least five days.
Tom is drunk.
May I turn down the TV?
I didn't think anyone was home.
There is no wind today.
That's what I told them.
Unexpected stuff happens all the time.
Let's go back before it begins to rain.
Let's go to bed.
We are going to travel abroad this summer.
We'll eat at six o'clock.
We all had a great time.
I don't like her.
Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
Be careful with what you drink.
I majored in psychology.
You're very understanding.
The truth is I told a lie.
Is there something in the fridge we can drink?
My son can tell time.
I know a man who can speak Russian well.
Tomorrow is another day.
I'm unbiased.
I was totally dumbfounded.
We're just starting.
He changed his address.
Don't talk to me like that.
What is your registration number?
Do you have some wine?
She advised him to go abroad while he was still young.
No one made you do anything.
Can I be of any assistance to you?
I think we'll be OK.
I want you to come somewhere with me.
My opinion differs from hers.
Check out what I've been up to.
Everybody loves her.
Mother approved my plan.
Can you play the organ?
I actually had fun tonight.
I went to see a show today.
What if someone sees us?
I'm pretty sure that's Tom's goal.
I had to stay.
She had a crush on him.
I don't have any friends to talk to.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
Do I look happy to you?
You're too hard on yourself.
The police found a dead body in an abandoned car near the park.
Do you want to see something gross?
May I have a glass of wine, please?
You're very stylish.
I will write you back soon.
I can't believe you're giving up.
Are you kidding?
I didn't take it that seriously.
You're smarter than me.
An elephant is a very large animal.
I am studying now.
I had to lie again.
Tom asked us to sit down.
His cousin lives in America.
Do you have any non-alcoholic drinks?
That wouldn't be a good thing.
Is there anyone else around?
I give my word.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
Summer has arrived at last.
He kicked the ball with his foot.
Was it all worth it?
I couldn't afford to do that.
The teacher is Chinese.
I feel like I know you already.
She was brushing her hair in front of a mirror.
They deserve respect.
I'll be ready in a second.
You need to be prepared.
Mother prepared us lunch.
Tom was arrested Monday night.
I don't know why I did that.
Who is this girl?
I wish you were here.
As a singer, she's well known.
Tom was great tonight.
There is no hope.
How dare you speak to me like that?
It's a matter of survival.
What else do you think Tom is planning to do?
You don't have to explain.
This time, you've gone too far.
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
Go to the park.
I'm happy to report that we won.
Don't get any ideas.
Life is unpredictable.
Are you telling me the truth?
He will advise you on that matter.
I'll be there right away.
I don't regret what happened last night.
I suppose you've already bought a ticket.
Eggs are sold by the dozen.
Where would you like to go next?
You're worried, aren't you?
Meet me in the hot tub.
She did not listen.
Just exactly what do you want me to do?
I arrived here yesterday.
We know each other.
Where did you meet your boyfriend?
Do you have any idea how important your test grades are?
You almost died.
I want to be with you.
These boxes are made out of plastic.
I sure appreciate all your help.
I think this is perfect.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
I know you're not going to come to my party, but I wish you were.
He came running.
I was quite surprised.
Are you tired of living?
I'm glad you could come to the party.
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Two women are singing.
He is well-liked.
I don't want it.
Lock the door behind me.
It's hard to swat a fly with your bare hand.
Instead of going myself, I sent a messenger.
I never want us to be unhappy.
You're one of them, aren't you?
He went to the library.
I myself have never seen a UFO.
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
Tom lived next to his uncle.
There are more clouds today than yesterday.
I don't have time to explain it now.
No one wanted to insult these men.
We have finished lunch.
Tom complained about the room being too small.
Get out of the van.
What did you get for Christmas?
I was uncomfortable.
Tom is wearing John's shoes.
He cleaned it up.
Are you at work?
The train was held up because of the railroad accident.
Above all, be patient.
The baby fell asleep.
I can't go in there.
Tomorrow will be even warmer than today.
You look just like my sister.
I hurried in order not to be late for school.
Who are you there with?
You must certainly be very hungry now.
I don't think I can help you.
I met her by chance.
I can't keep you here any longer.
Are you going by bus or car?
I'm lucky.
Have you ever been married?
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I obeyed the rules.
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV.
What's your favorite piece of furniture?
Before going to study in Paris, I must brush up on my French.
I'm not qualified to do this job.
I think we all should have been more careful.
The rich have many friends.
I want my money back now.
It's all true.
For me, being a doctor isn't a job, it's a calling.
I'll try that.
He works as hard as any student.
Whatever you do, don't run.
I have three times more money than you do.
Try to sleep.
The more foolish a child is, the cuter he seems to his parents.
They gave us their word.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
He doesn't like oranges.
I want to get as far away from here as I can.
I'm intrigued.
Would you mind taking a picture of us?
I'm sorry for everything.
I have confidence in him.
I'm doing everything I can.
They told me about it.
Tom began to laugh.
Where is your school?
He has a fear that his brother will fail.
The room has two windows.
I am in the habit of taking a shower in the morning.
Who cares when she gets married?
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
Nobody encouraged her.
Why wasn't I informed earlier?
He left the house.
Would you like tea or coffee?
I should head out.
She has a rose in her hand.
I feel his pain.
I finally got across the river.
Why did you get up so early?
He wrapped his arms around her.
That was only a figure of speech.
Do you smoke?
Let's begin on page 30.
I love to see you smile.
It is likely to be cold this winter.
Is this where you live?
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
That's just what I wanted to hear.
My big brother finished his homework very quickly.
She peeked through the curtain.
He isn't an American.
He wanted to meet you.
Do you remember your grandfather?
People are getting antsy.
They're terrified of you.
Make it smaller.
I have been expecting you.
Our car broke down on our way there.
Everybody seeks happiness.
Come in.
I am older than him.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
I think you're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
I just want to make sure we all agree.
Some of them are healthy, but others are not.
The train finally arrived.
"Are scientists close to cloning a human being?" "Not by a long shot."
What is it you really want to tell me?
I'm coming to pick you up.
I figured I might be able to help.
You're not the only one with this problem.
Why did you listen to them?
I'll pick you up at your home.
We're going back to Boston.
I want to have something to remember you by.
What sort of play is it?
I just don't want to fight with you.
You don't seem very sure.
I'm not going to help you.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
The Netherlands is a small country.
Sorry for not answering your question. I didn't see it.
She agreed to my idea.
He wiped the sweat from his face.
He pretends to be enthusiastic when his boss is around.
I thought you were taller.
You can't be forced to testify against your husband.
I'm glad to be here.
Please be honest.
The stock price index soared to an all-time high.
You're not helping, Tom.
She failed every time she tried.
I have a backache.
I made my dog lie down.
We were all present at the meeting.
I feel a lot better now, but I know Dad's going to be real upset.
I suppose it's my fault.
You owe me a beer.
Have you ever eaten anything that made you hallucinate?
Tom is much fatter than Mary.
He had lost all hope.
I think that helps.
I heard the leaves rustling.
A lot of people do that.
You'd better not see her now.
Mary and Alice both married men younger than them.
I know what you're doing.
He wrote the report.
She said with a smile.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Did you see him at the station this morning?
Tom twisted my arm.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
That isn't what I'm talking about.
Let's not do anything that might get us in trouble.
I thought I was being smart.
I just want you to think about me once in a while.
She wept bitterly.
This tastes moldy.
I'll never forget the sight.
I don't want to go to school.
Rome is in Italy.
I can understand what she is saying.
If you need my advice, I'd be glad to give it to you.
She should help her mother.
What's your problem?
I've already told you what I think.
I couldn't find his house.
You needed me.
He bowed to the Queen.
I'm going to wear these shoes on our date tonight.
I didn't see you until now.
He jumped into the water.
I called him this morning.
Stand back!
I'll destroy it.
Tom bought a box of candy to give to Mary.
Fresh food is wonderful.
A pub is a popular gathering place in which to drink beer.
I have no interest whatsoever in eating English food.
Population growth has given rise to serious social problems.
How did we get into so much trouble?
I go home right after work.
Tom pointed at Mary.
I can't do what I'm being paid to do.
How do I know that you're not going to try to kill me?
You have put your hat on backwards.
My girlfriend is Chinese.
I just want you to be involved.
The joke's on you.
They defended their country.
The neighbors will call the police if you don't turn the music down.
How could you say that?
Try and stop me.
You said you wanted the truth.
I apologize for not writing to you before.
She advised him to stop working so much.
Someone has brought us some grapes.
Are you enjoying the play?
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
Tell Tom I don't know where he parked his car.
Is this fish still alive?
Keep focused on your goals.
You wanted this, didn't you?
He came home very late.
I feel like a drink.
Your answer is wrong.
He kept on crying.
It's just a scratch, OK?
That's how I got to know her.
Have a nice holiday.
I want to talk to you about this report.
They walked upstairs.
You have our respect.
I have a slight headache.
I don't switch on the light in my studio at night.
I understand.
The coach gave me some advice.
Tom got into trouble because of Mary.
I remember them.
She's six years older than I am.
That girl looks like a boy.
You think you're funny?
She wasn't able to talk to him.
I won't fight with you anymore.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Drink up your milk.
So you are really offering me a Roflex watch for 5 dollars?
You don't need to convince me.
The baby sleeping in the baby carriage is as cute as an angel.
I left the room.
You can trust him.
What happened can't be undone.
The Americans did not like the new plan.
He's an undergrad.
Did you win the case?
It's early.
Are you looking at me?
Which party do you belong to?
The latest issue of the magazine will come out next Monday.
Will it clear up soon?
We ate breakfast at seven.
You don't know what you're doing.
What's taking you so long?
Both of my sisters are married.
How about running?
They left.
I got really mad.
He began to sweat.
Lay down on the couch.
I'm not even sure I want to see that movie.
Without your help, I would have failed.
I'd like to get medical insurance.
I thought your parents liked me.
There isn't any problem at all.
Turn the radio up a little.
He thinks he's so great.
Show me a list of your rates, please.
I think it's reliable.
Wow, it's pretty cold today.
It happened so fast.
What don't you want me to do?
I don't feel like laughing.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
By the way, how many of you are keeping a diary?
I'd like to be woken up tomorrow at 6:30.
Are you going to be OK?
How many times do I have to tell you not to eat candy just before dinner?
Tom hates the rules.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
He's innocent.
Could you please tell me again who your father is?
It is not easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom told me he checked the oil level.
I'm feeling better.
It's about the size of an egg.
He found her irresistible.
Are you busy?
I don't think I can keep that promise.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Tom will be in Boston next year.
A cat has two ears.
We're hot.
You'd be perfect for that.
You were right, too.
Do you want to go shopping with me?
Would you please take my picture?
Can we make one of those?
I can do it.
It's not fair to you.
I didn't say anything.
Does anybody need anything?
What do you think of it?
You remind me of my daughter.
Would you happen to be married?
I'll remember you forever.
I smelled bacon.
I'm afraid I can't finish them in time.
I remember seeing him once.
I can't hear a thing.
Your suggestion is of no practical use.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my mother.
Can we leave?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Show me some respect.
Everybody in the village looks up to him.
How can they just make up stuff like that?
Is this why you've come back?
I was bored.
Grab that.
Soldiers shared their food with the Indians.
South Africa is far away.
I think I see the problem.
I don't want Tom to know this.
Both of them started crying.
I love this place.
You must not behave like this.
Let me spell it out for you.
My wife's pregnant.
Why don't you stay there?
It sounds crazy.
I think it's time for me to clean the garage.
We probably don't have enough time to finish doing that today.
Tom wasn't flirting.
That's why I'm so fat.
I beg your pardon.
It's been a long time since I last spoke French.
He used to love her.
I need to know.
Should we start?
Why would I want your watch?
I had some things to do.
These books are mine.
If you alter the plan, you must inform the team members of the changes.
Summer days can be very, very hot.
How exactly am I supposed to do that?
Are you studying English?
Get up at once, or you will miss the 7:00 bus.
Don't call her now.
She dressed like a boy.
You have to report to the police at once.
Tom is just a little bit shorter than me.
Tom began to shiver uncontrollably.
I don't know anything about the future.
You're not paying attention.
I thought we were welcome here.
I don't care about any of that.
How many books do you possess?
I have no energy today.
I object to being treated like that.
There is a subtle difference between the two words.
She has a bicycle.
He was successful in the attempt.
I don't know how you did it, but you did it.
I'm the happiest man in the world.
This is what I want to do.
The court found him guilty.
When did they build that?
The rain continued all day.
I know you love Tom.
Tom is much better today than yesterday.
I know that you are busy.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
If we leave now, we could be back in Tucson before nightfall.
Do it again!
I thought I told you to clean your room.
Tom should be back here by 2:30.
You're one of them, aren't you?
First of all, let me speak about myself.
I really need a drink.
Not a sound was heard.
He saved us all.
I'm surprised it was that easy.
What's in all these boxes?
Why does he become drowsy whenever he begins to study?
He tried getting close to her using every means possible.
I've got you.
Could you give an example?
His work is below average.
I appreciate how you feel.
Who are you going with?
Show us the solution.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
You have no idea how tired I am of all this complaining.
Are you here to help us?
Let's go.
I don't care what you do.
I don't expect anything from you.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
Tom was bleeding heavily.
One of the main products of this country is coffee.
I'm too tired to go out jogging.
We shouldn't accept his explanation at face value.
You can't trust Tom.
Can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant?
All the students are present.
What kinds of goods do you sell in your shop?
Isn't this place great?
What does he say in his letter?
You're very clever.
My opinion is entirely different from yours.
Spare me the grisly details.
You know I can't wait for you if you're late.
I think it'll freeze tonight.
I'd like to go, too.
He doesn't want to live in the city.
Where's Tom now?
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
Her older daughter is married.
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake.
Tom was upstairs.
We've been eating a lot of beans lately.
Let's get on with the meeting.
Isn't there anyone you know?
He wants to sell his old car to a man in Kobe.
I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully.
You don't seem to want to come with us.
Each one of the world's great successes was a failure first.
Why don't you run for student council?
I hesitated about which road to take.
Our team is two points ahead.
Tom didn't get paid for the work he did.
Who's that beautiful woman eating all alone?
I'm as shocked as you are.
This is by far the best novel that has been published this year.
You speak French, right?
If you were in my place, what would you do?
Tom brushed Mary's hair.
You'll have to learn all these dates by rote.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I have to be back home by seven.
You look pale today.
What is the cat up to?
Ants work hard all summer.
He kept silent during the meeting.
There is a lady downstairs who wants to speak to you.
I grew up in this house.
The weather service has issued a severe weather warning.
I'd like to ask you a question, but if this is a bad time, I can come back at another time.
Why don't we ask his advice?
It's been a while since I've eaten anything with mustard.
Tom is tireless.
I can't break this code.
Will you light the fire?
That depends on you.
She cried bitterly.
I wanted to thank you for what you did today.
I must obey.
Call me if you have any problems.
It's a matter of pride.
Do you believe global warming is the result of human actions?
Are you there?
I want to hear you say it.
There's no way to predict what you will dream tonight.
I really didn't want to go to work today.
Tom can remember the chords to the song, but can't remember all the lyrics.
I can't find my luggage.
I hate you both.
Tom intends to become a journalist.
Would you like to have some tea?
We're looking for a friend of ours.
I would like to improve my English pronunciation.
They don't know yet.
She was panting.
We've all seen it.
An eagle's wings are more than one meter across.
I have some money.
I took the opportunity to visit the museum.
He felt himself being lifted up.
He refused to pay.
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
He has a sufficient income to support his family.
I will have to study harder.
You can't carry on like this.
We're going to do it again.
I'm sorry, but he isn't home.
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
I found it in the attic.
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
I suppose you have a plan.
I want to know who started it.
That's a pretty dress you have on.
Did that accident really happen last year?
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
It is up to you to decide what to do.
He likes swimming in the summer.
She was a bundle of nerves last night.
What is the temperature?
I'm glad that you can come.
You're the one who trained me.
Smoking is harmful to your health.
Show it to her.
I left it on the table.
It is no use giving her advice.
You better get some sleep.
I wish I had a friend like you.
We sometimes swim in the lake.
It is no use blaming him for the accident now.
He was chosen captain.
I still care.
I can't believe you'd do that.
He caught a large trout.
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.
I'm aware of that.
I'm really glad I ran into you.
I do not know exactly.
The freight train was held up about half an hour because of a dense fog.
We're all having lunch.
We hope to see you again.
You should relax a little.
When I was in school, left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hands.
This kind of book is of no use to us.
In those days, few people could travel abroad.
I figured you might need some help.
You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in.
He was foolish enough to believe it.
You should relax a little.
Would you like to leave a message for him?
Where else should we go?
He addressed the audience in a soft voice.
No one's home.
He promised to provide information.
He locked himself in the bathroom.
Call me when you can.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
Are you a law student?
Many Americans protested the purchase of Alaska.
May I move to the other side now?
Stop taking pictures. You look like a tourist.
Tom would say yes.
Get control of yourself.
Get out of my office.
It would be better if we didn't attend that meeting.
I'm too sleepy to drive.
She's a jealous woman.
The bird spread its wings.
They can't hear you.
Does this look familiar to you?
You're finicky.
He can speak Russian, too.
They adopted the orphan.
Tom will never change.
Check this.
You're a woman now.
I feel bad for her.
Don't you have a bicycle?
Of all the films I rented, this is the only one worth seeing.
I'm still waiting for your answer.
I hope Tom proves me wrong.
A good sense of humor will help you deal with hard times.
It happened in a flash.
He was every inch a king.
How did you hear about us?
Do you want to get drunk?
This painting is worth a great deal of money.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
I'm waiting for her to come here.
I lost everything I had.
Rather than cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
Is that machine still usable?
You're a traitor.
Don't ask me to explain it.
I've been waiting for hours.
She seems friendly.
Have yourself a drink.
I don't need to talk to you.
She hung the calendar on the wall.
I hear you're moving out.
After what happened, I would've thought Tom would go back to Boston.
I don't want to eat lunch now.
I was tired so I went to bed.
War began five years later.
The friend who I thought would pass the exam failed it.
Don't you like swimming?
Children grow very quickly.
I'd rather walk than take a bus.
You learn something new every day.
I've often heard about you.
I just want to make sure we all agree.
How do we explain this?
I don't want to be pitied.
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
I'm not eating this.
They want more space.
They entered into a heated discussion.
He knows a lot about foreign affairs.
I've decided to give Tom another chance.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
This bike belongs to my little brother.
How much do you love Tom?
I usually go to school by bus.
Tom is your age.
You're ruthless.
Let's get back to work.
How's your father?
There goes our bus.
It affects all of us.
We had a spell of fine weather last autumn.
I don't have that.
What's happened here is a travesty.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
I figured I could count on you.
We talked in sign language.
He made up his mind quickly.
What do nurses spend most of their time doing?
I can speak Chinese, but I can't read it.

The audience were all foreigners.
Are you done washing your hands?
The temperature fell several degrees.

Tom, who had been working all day, wanted to have a rest.
We looked around the property.
We have a bit of time now.
I'll change.
We wanted to wish you good luck.
They told me about it.
Are you settling in?
Tom understands the risks.
That will benefit the community.
What're you all dressed up for?
Love is blinding you.
I don't know how to describe it.
How long did you live there?
Remind me that the meeting is on Monday.
He's not stupid.
They had once helped each other.
She was overcome with happiness.
You need to be more patient.
I hadn't thought about that.
You can say whatever you want to.
I followed the recipe.
I don't know because I wasn't there.
Can you do it faster?
They're not expensive.
Tom is on leave.
You're the teacher.
I don't want to be your enemy.
Complaining won't change anything.
I need an escort.
Is there a hat shop nearby?
You don't know where it is, do you?
Do you like to be alone?
She handed him a book.
A good citizen obeys the laws.
You are entirely correct.
This letter is wrongly addressed.
Bring me a sheet of paper, please.
Take the medicine three times a day.
Cut that out!
Crime does not pay.
Please be serious.
He is what we call a scholar.
I don't like shellfish.
That's what I'm here for.
Please tell me the story once more.
We're not fools.
Tom threw something at me and I ducked.
This was a long letter.
I hate all of them.
One of the people you were with is a friend of mine.
The princess lay with her eyes closed.
Tom isn't good-looking.
I had to accept it.
I took his umbrella by mistake.
Did you encounter any problems?
You are lying.
Your English is improving.
What do you want then?
Tom put the sign to the wall.
I left home early so I wouldn't miss the train.
I asked him to be here by six.
Maybe you should call the police.
Now leave us.
Carry the bags upstairs.
Let's try something.
It makes me really happy that you're here.
Your philosophy of life is different than mine.
I'd like to go back to the office.
Many foreign customs were introduced into Japan after the war.
What do you think of Tom's new tattoo?
You would be safe there.
It can't be kept secret forever.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
He could not hold back his tears.
I wish there were some cute guys in my class.
He is uncertain about his future.
Just tell Tom to leave me alone.
I heard the door open.
This bicycle belongs to me.
I shouldn't have gone there.
That was amazing.
I can't remember anything from last night.
We talked.
What'll we do?
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?
I heard everything.
This is the book I want to give my mother.
Don't play baseball in the park.
He's in big trouble.
I didn't think you would win the race.
I liked it.
Are you still playing the guitar?
Answer my question.
When did you visit your friends?
They assigned the task to us.
My father is not as old as he looks.
Get back into your car.
You should follow your teacher's advice.
Good luck with that.
Why don't you stay a while?
I have to go to the police station.
I sleep with two quilts in the winter.
We must separate politics from religion.
I hope you find it interesting.
How did you learn to cook so well?
If you'd asked me, I'd have told you.
Get some sleep.
There's somebody coming up the stairs.
My watch loses two minutes a day.
What's that supposed to mean?
If you don't want to give a speech, you don't have to.
You'll get another chance.
Tom used to eat a lot of meat.
Please do not try this at home.
He has a son and two daughters.
I surrender.
The paint is peeling off.
You don't have to do what Tom says.
I was in charge.
It's not about them.
I thought the company had sent Tom to Boston.
I'll be seventeen next year.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
I really thought I'd win.
First, let's talk about Tom.
Have you ever been lonely?
I think Tom can help Mary.
Go away before they see you here.
I sell flowers.
Be prepared.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
You must know that I snore.
I want my job back.
The girl caught a small fish.
The leaves fell.
Thanks for photocopying it for me.
I just have one question.
My body aches all over.
Tom worked overtime.
The hotel burned down.
I knew nobody would believe me.
Please turn on the TV.
Tom was lying in bed watching TV.
If we're going to do this, let's do it right.
I am not concerned with this affair.
According to the contract you may take three days of bereavement leave for your uncle's funeral, but only one for your nephew's.
I had been reading for an hour when he came in.
It reminded me of you.
I sure hope so.
This work is simple enough for a child to do.
Let her sleep.
I like the color green.
Why did you ask Tom to do that when you knew he couldn't do it?
Will he come this evening?
What were you two talking about?
How do I turn this off?
We discussed the problem at length.
He appreciates Japanese culture.
She lost her temper and shouted at me.
What do you need to know?
You'll get over it.

I'm tired of playing games.
God bless you!
He lost hope and killed himself by taking poison.
Don't turn around.

I hate this rug.
Tom should stay where he is.
They live in that house among the trees.
I have many friends I can talk to.
She's rolling in money.
Young men such as you are needed for this work.
You should pay attention to his story.
If you want to succeed in life, work hard.
Do you want that warmed up?
I wanted to go there.
You were happy.
We have no choice but to carry on.
May God bless you.
I'm not very busy.
Can you afford it?
It was a bold decision.
You came too late.
Did you buy a return ticket?
This is a very important day for us.
The violence lasted for two weeks.
We all understand.
You've really helped me a lot.
I understand that it's not fair.
One plus two equals three.
I still don't know what I'm going to say.
Such a plan is bound to fail.
Just do what I say.
I think he's too young.
We'll begin work soon.
The x-ray showed two broken fingers.
We don't need you anymore.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
I have two sisters and one brother.
Bring me my glasses.
Tom had nothing to say.
I was trying to be supportive.
She enjoyed conversing with him.
It's just not fair.
This book is worth reading.
He landed a big trout.
Are you coming down?
Keep your hands above the table.
Let's do our job.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
You should see a doctor.
Do you want this or don't you?
This time, you've gone too far.
What's your plan?
He took a room at the Yaesu Hotel.
Dreaming costs nothing.
I would really like to explore this cave.
I'm aware of the risks.
There is a message for you.
Does it snow much in the winter?
Are you aware you're being named in a lawsuit against the federal government?
Tell me what's going on.
I've been very busy since this morning.
When I run, I get sweaty.
Tom doesn't think it'll snow tomorrow.
This was not supposed to happen.
Put it onto the table.
You must not be late for school.
Take a chance.
The door opened automatically.
The spider web glistened in the morning dew.

Let me handle it.
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
I'm happy enough.
It's an older model.
She has a bicycle.
Empty your pockets!
They'll tell you the truth.
It seems that no one knew the truth.
It's not impossible.
You don't have the right.
Tom always flies economy class to save money.
I'd like to hear what your opinion is.
She gave him a lot of money.
She has marginalized herself.
I don't want a boyfriend.
May I set the table?
He wrote this book at the age of twenty.
We grew closer every day.
She went with him to the zoo.
You may as well tell me all about it.
I feel very relaxed.

You don't have to respond.
I have a friend living in London.

You can't do anything right, can you?
I told you everything I knew.
There are more cars on the road in the summer than in the winter.
I like having breakfast with you.
We're not dressed.

I'm writing a letter.
We're closed tomorrow.
There are still many things left to do.
Do you know the reason why she is so angry?
My father is an expert surgeon.
I became rich.
My hands and legs are swollen.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't be able to earn more than thirty dollars an hour.
It's too early for you to come.
This textbook is good.
He smells bad.
It's all that matters.
I thought I'd surprise you.
Let's do this now.
I couldn't bring myself to take the job.
Tom isn't very funny.
I will definitely attend your funeral.
I understand you.
She is different from her sister in every way.
The earth rotates.
I feel guilty.
I can't go on with this.
My grandmother became sick last week.
Our hens laid a lot of eggs yesterday.
The plane arrived on time.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
No one wants to fight.
You can't blame yourself.
I walked to school.
I came back home late.
You will soon get to like him.
Your house is fantastic.
It's starting to snow.
Take that back.
We made sure of it.
We have suppliers.
I can't even afford to buy a used car.
You are a good person.
Now's not the time.
You nearly died.
Sorry about the mess.
I have a fever and I ache all over.
His parents were pleased with his success.
The mafia boss was killed in a hail of machine gun fire.
This is kind of fun.
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
I told you guys to go home. Why are you still here?
He was elected mayor of the city.
It couldn't hurt.
Japan imports great quantities of crude oil.
There were 30 survivors.
Do as you like.
We need help.
I would like to know how you will proceed in this matter.
The gang is all here.
You're all insane.
His wife goes with him wherever he goes.
That's a plan.
Mary is very attached to the little girl.
Don't let the dog inside.
How many did you want?
She is a fox.
I don't even want you there.
I want to figure this out.
When I take a deep breath, a pain runs down the right side of my back.
I feel guilty about having told a lie.
She is teaching us French.
I have a receipt.
I practiced speaking French with Tom.
I'm ready to go now.
I thought you liked me.
I had to do it by myself.
We need to go.
Tom treats me like a child.
Not everyone agrees with you.
We moved into this house last month, but we still haven't settled down.
I know that it is highly unlikely that you'd ever want to go out with me, but I still need to ask at least once.
Tom is recovering from his injuries.
I'll win using whatever means it takes.
What's the plan?
He looked well.
This medicine is still not sold in pharmacies.
There are many words that I don't understand.
Get back to the ship.
We're going out.
She's good at tennis.
Cricket is a game that takes skill.
Do fish sleep?
Do you have enough money?
The bus is full. You'll have to wait for the next one.
Do you know how to cook rice well?
You're safe now.
Is that thing working?
I'm happy because you're here.
We look up to him as our leader.
Did you iron all the shirts?
Tom needs some new clothes.
He's a very nice boy.
The lock must be broken.
You've turned up at the right moment.
The letter was written by hand.
She has no one to turn to.
I just did what the boss asked me to do.
She's not as old as Mary.
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
Don't worry about it.
His daughter is sick.
What's wrong with you?
I'll come as soon as I can.
I just don't want to lose you.
We met last Thursday.
I don't want to wait that long.
I thought it was a joke.
I'm a good-for-nothing bum.
Tom bought an expensive Christmas present for himself.
That's just what I need.
These products are selling like hot cakes.
You're not supposed to do that, are you?
Having lived in Tokyo, I know the city well.
I know what you're thinking.
I suppose it can't be helped.
I honestly think it's better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.
I don't have to talk to you.
I love hard-boiled eggs.
Tom is already sleeping.
Does that suit you?
Have you finished the work yet?
You really should read it.
Things are starting to take shape.
You look perfect.
Don't get yourself killed.
I'm a natural blonde.
I'm leaving it to you.
I've been trying to find out who was responsible for the accident.
Do you have a room of your own?
I'll see you in the morning.
You didn't tell me everything.
I enjoyed it very much.
You should marry someone you love.
He got lost on his way to the village.
He ought to have arrived in New York by now.
I'm doing this for them.
I meant it as a joke.
I work as a museum attendant.
We could've made a fortune.
She is currently in danger.
I'd like to give this to somebody we can trust.
How many caps do you own?
Copper and silver are both metals.
Be quiet while I am speaking.
Could you spare me a few minutes?
The water in this river is very clean.
Are you up?
You went to the park yesterday, didn't you?
Tom has been patiently waiting all morning.
I just can't live without you.
I promise you I'll explain everything later.
My aunt gave me an album.
That's very funny.
He stopped talking to them.
Do you weigh more than Tom?
I cannot get in touch with him.
I never should've listened to you.
Leave the room immediately.
Not all girls are like that.
I'm not going to study French anymore.
I'll give you this pendant.
I know all about it.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
This supermarket delivers only on Saturday.
Do you think he's really into me?
My uncle has a glass eye and a wooden leg.
We won.
I declined his invitation to dinner.
What did we miss?
How did it end?
I read the letter again and again.
Her father became an invalid as a result of a heart attack.
Where were you born?
I continued reading.
I think it's time for me to get my eyes checked.
I have never seen her help her father.
It was not clear what she really meant.
Tom doesn't want to give up his dream of becoming an astronaut.
What kind of changes do you want us to make?
He is wandering around in a trance.
What's the plan now?
Let us never speak of this again.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Just tell me what happened.
The girls had a catfight.
I took for granted that he got homesick.
What's the name of the mountain range?
You should go talk to him.
He quickly scanned my manuscript.
She suggested that I should clean the bathroom.
I'm afraid I have no experience.
Everybody was stunned.
In the early days of American history, blacks lived in slavery.
He attended the meeting as the company representative.
I will deal with them myself.
The next morning, the snowman had completely melted.
Can you show me how to tie a tie?
It's business as usual.
Tell me what your name is.
Stay right where you are.
They drank two bottles of wine.
What else do you want?
I got a bargain.
Don't get too comfortable.
I'm as curious as you are.
Why would anybody want to do that?
Don't you see what's happened?
I do not want to reply to his letter.
She asked them to take their shoes off.
You have my mug.
Could you talk a little slower?
I think Tom said he'd be staying in Boston for three weeks.
Tom certainly had something to say.
I think you did it.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
Please have a seat.
It's neat and clean.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
It takes time to speak a foreign language well.
A one-way ticket to Birmingham, please.
I suspect you're wrong.
The ages of the two children put together was equivalent to that of their father.

Were you playing tennis yesterday morning?
I have two cameras.
This photo was taken in Nara.
Tell them what you're doing here.
I've locked myself out of my house.
She is sewing a dress.
He abandoned his hope of becoming a doctor.
Drop the gun.
Since there were no taxis, I had to walk.
A girl phoned me.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
I want to stay here longer.
I thought you could help me.
Come soon or there won't be any food left.
I've heard that story already.
Did the union participate in the demonstration?
It's open to interpretation.
Even though she was a heavy woman, she danced well.
Don't be so negative.
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
I awoke to find a bird in my room.
We traveled together.
She stayed in that area for a short while.
One of my wisdom teeth is coming in.
He cleared his throat.
Where are we going?
What time did you close the store last night?
He's looking at you.
I'd like to know exactly how much money is in my account.
You can't do two things at once.
A detective arrived upon the scene of the crime.
Tom will find you.
I can't do what you want.
I'm going to take some pictures.
She held him like mother gorillas hold their babies.
I knew it would be painful.
English is a global language.
I waited three hours.
They explored the Antarctic.
This pen belongs to me.
I owe my success to his help.
Not all experts agree.
I am working hard trying to learn English.
Are you the girl Tom has been dating?
He claimed that the enormous property was at his disposal.
Read this passage and translate it into Japanese.
I've lost my keys.
Some voters waited hours to vote.
Please follow me.
I'm ready to face any challenge.

Does anyone care?
What are you saving up for?
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world after the Nile.
He won the prize last week.
He wrote a book about the American Civil War.
The answer was right in front of me.
I want to tell you something important.
I will give you a call as soon as I get home.
Do you want to know why Tom left?
He is generally at home in the evening.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
When can you start?
Are you ready to begin?
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
Are there two windows in your room?
They live in tents.
I had a hard time trying to persuade him to cancel the trip.
The king reigned over the island.
Tom is an orphan.
Tom has denied the allegation.
She burned herself while lighting a cigarette.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
You shouldn't let people use you like that.
She didn't show up.
I heard my phone ring.
Now isn't a very good time.
Do you mean you don't find that odd?
How is your family doing?
Is that what you want to do?
The bill was approved by an overwhelming majority.
He turned a blind eye.
So what does it mean?
Tom went back to his bedroom.
You're very astute.
I'd never hire Tom.
It's a complicated matter.
Tom has some very good news.
I don't understand music.
Let's just listen.
He wasn't earning a large salary when he retired.
Tom doesn't like to be made to wait.
I had that weird dream again last night.
I awoke on the floor.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
I'll send someone up to help you now.
Thirteen homes have been destroyed.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I'll make some coffee.
The peasantry revolted wielding pitchforks and clubs.
I just didn't want you to worry.
I'm glad to see you're OK.
The girl is skillful with her fingers.
She didn't like the horse at first.
We differed as to the solution to the problem.
From an objective viewpoint, his argument was far from rational.
I've already memorized your phone number.
That really hurts.
I am glad to hear the news.
We'll be back on air shortly.
He's at her side.
The knife is not sharp.
She scolded him for being late.
I'd like to go to college.
It seems to me that I heard a noise in the attic.
I bet you're right.
He didn't see a thing.
This song is very popular in Japan.
Who's going to drive?
Tom didn't do anything else.
She gets prettier day by day.
Did he admit that he was wrong?
He's very understanding.
Can you tell me what this word means?
Can you point me in the right direction?
We can handle that.
He didn't get her joke.
How does the film end?
You don't understand women, Tom.
I urge everyone to do the same.
Tom isn't a boy anymore.
Do you have any books in French?
Who is the person in charge?
I rang the bell.
Why couldn't I be the one to help you?
What did they hit you with?
Wait for Tom.
I believe I am in the right.
You must've thought I was an idiot.
I am very tall.
I'd like to find somebody to talk to.
He took back everything he said.
Don't judge me too harshly.
I'm as tall as my father.
He shrank back in the face of danger.
I'd say you're jealous.
I appreciate your telling me.
He doesn't have a family.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
This book is easy to read.
You can take whatever you like.
And what do I have to do now?
I know what those books are like.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I must say I'm flattered.
We know all this already, Tom.
Tom tried to keep calm.
As we age, our ability to remember gets worse.
Don't tell me he's dead.
Do you have an extra English dictionary by any chance?
We have to do our best.
Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
Your daughter's on drugs.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
I don't want Tom to help me.
He will live forever in our hearts.
I was caught in a traffic jam.
I said that wasn't what I meant.
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
This handbag is mine.
Is it possible to drink salt water?
The nurse has given Tom a sedative.
Bring me the Kleenex.
She's only two years old, but she can already count to 100.
Why wait for Christmas?
He's addicted.
Tom lied to you, didn't he?
I don't know if that's wise or not.
It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
He makes it a point to remember each one of our birthdays.
I don't want any ice cream.
He picked up a red stone.
I'm all out of ideas.
The animal struggled to get out of the cage.
My mother took my temperature.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
I was arrested on the spot.
Not knowing what to do, he asked me for help.
Could we have a table in the corner?
He can't drive.
I want to stay in the house.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
They didn't want me to examine it.
Who will look after the baby?
We hurried to catch the bus.
It's a shame that the singer died so young.
I hope I haven't offended anyone.
Don't ever underestimate Tom.
You and I made a bargain.
All the buses are full.
Every time she coughed, she felt a great deal of pain.
We do not know her.
We had to stop.
He found no difficulty in solving the problem.
It won't be hard.
You get out only what you put in.
I want to have a part-time job, too.
Why do you want to work for our company?
I'm sure you must have a lot of questions.
The radio warned us of the coming earthquake and we started gathering our things.
I’ve made a few corrections.
I don't mean you.
There must be another way.
How old is that dog?
He decided to quit smoking.
Will you show me your photo album?
We have a similar predicament.
Don't trample on the grass.
I don't know much about this subject.
All you have to do is sign your name here.
I'm sure you never told me not to do this.
He chose his words carefully.
Don't slam the door.
Tom didn't get home till midnight.
She's at work, isn't she?
Come early so we can discuss the plans.
I don't like any of them.
Next person, please.
She got to the hotel late at night.
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
He came in spite of the heavy snow.
I ran outside and the door locked itself behind me.
It doesn't matter whether he agrees or not.
Are you still there?
Tom knows I'm right.
He lives in Morocco.
What's your blood type?
Did I surprise you?
I'll handle this.
I didn't have much time.
His wife is Swedish.
We're plastered.
Calculate how much money we will need next year.
He did the right thing.
I wish you all good luck.
Don't you hate it when that happens?
How big is your house?
Why don't you pull over?
My father was still at home when I left.
Do I have to undress?
I may have told you this story before.
He tumbled down the stairs.
That's my wish.
She advised him to get more exercise.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
Where does he work?
There was a big gold star on the door.
He gave it to me.
Laws differ from state to state in the United States.
Everything's going be all right.
I prefer not to discuss it here.
There's still so much left to do.
Did I interrupt something important?
I just got my first tattoo.
Tom went outside to smoke a cigarette.
There are not enough chairs for us to sit on.
She has a flower in her hand.
You're very clever.
Will you give me a ride to my hotel?
You promised.
It is me that is wrong.
Can I see your driver's license?
I feel like an outsider.
I didn't steal it. You can check my pockets.
The council agreed on it.
You look a little shaken.
Do you still have feelings for her?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Old habits are hard to break.
I don't need your money. I just need your time.
The news can't be true.
You must realize that I can't help you.
I can't blame Tom for hating me.
I hate being photographed.
I'm sure I turned off the gas.
How did you happen to see them doing it?
Tom can stay if he wants to.
I'm not shy.
Can you take the lid off this box?
There's not a cloud in the sky.
She always got up early.
It was hard for me to turn down his demand.
We painted the walls white.
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
I love comedies.
Tom told me he knew how to speak French.
The baby wants its mother.
I have been living in Rio de Janeiro for four years.
He waited until she came.
I think he likes you.
When you get on the highway, shift into fifth gear.
Don't underestimate my power.
You're all against me.
They have access to the library.
They're leaving.
I came back to help you.
I'm done with my chores.
How do you come to school?
I don't know what's happened.
I don't want to eat lunch now.
Cookie's mother died of cancer.
Don't call me.
She lay awake for hours thinking about him.
I want those back when you're done.
You're a nervous wreck.
My short-term memory is getting shorter and shorter.
This game is so hard.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
Mt. Fuji could be seen in the distance.
I have a lot of bills I have to pay.
They just left.
The train gathered speed.
I only have one condition.
She played the guitar and he sang.
I haven't seen you for a while.
We'll go to Hong Kong first, and then we'll go to Singapore.
Do you want me to believe that?
How could you say such a thing?
All the houses in this neighborhood look so much alike that I can't tell them apart.
Dozens of letters are awaiting you.
You're too clever for your own good.
I hardly see you anymore.
He decided to seek information elsewhere.
That's not the way it happened at all.
I saw nothing.
I think we're neighbors.
He's the same age as me.
I've attempted suicide twice.
You need to work together.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
He is a tennis player.
What's the capital city of Finland?
I'm glad you got home safely.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
Somebody's coming.
Why were you late this morning?
The mountains are reflected in the lake.
Don't you remember my name?
I was trapped in a vicious circle.
It must have slipped my mind.
I made up my mind to go there.
It's next to impossible to finish it in a day.
I told him about our school.
I'm not crazy.
Please find a solution to the problem.
Tom was sitting at a nearby table.
Can you iron this T-shirt for me, please?
If you do not have this book, you can buy it.
Tom showed Mary his garden.
My college has a dorm.
He studied military history.
I gave her just what she needed.
Do you really want to know the truth?
He transferred his office to Osaka.
Why does it take them so long to set up my internet connection?
The room was filled with people.
They want you to resign.
Can I use my travelers' checks to pay the fee?
His parents approve of the engagement.
It's not healthy for you.
Tom was the first boy to hug Mary.
Could you call me back later?
I like spring the best of the seasons.
Tom doesn't help me.
We need to go shopping.
The truth is that the parents were to blame.
There is a spoon missing.
It's our duty.
Call a doctor.
That old book is a real find.
That house is very small.
I am glad to help you.
You should stay in bed.
This part of the library is closed to the public.
My uncle died of cancer.
Don't expose this chemical to direct sunlight.
You are the most important person in my life.
My dad gives me an allowance of $10 a week.
Think it over and let me know what you decide.
Please call before you come.
I am going to stay with my aunt in Kyoto.
Everyone looks exhausted.
I was shaken.
You have no one but yourself to blame.
Thanks for joining us.
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
I have read your book. It's very interesting.
May God bless you.
She looks better in Japanese clothes.
When out at sea, to keep the fish that is caught from spoiling, it is immediately refrigerated.
I made Tom laugh.
Who wants to go shopping with me?
He had been walking for hours.
Please tell me you're joking.
Is he at home?
It was raining yesterday.
I'll leave you to it.
I just want you to listen.
I think you did a good job.
Stop talking about Tom.
It was careless of you to leave the key in the car.
It's the thought that counts.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
She invited me to her home.
This is getting difficult.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
It is imperative for you to act at once.
She treated him very well.
Nobody cares what you think.
If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it.
You have to do this whether you like it or not.
My dad is not home at the moment.
Why did you decide to buy this house?
Why do you keep giving him money?
Did you pay for everything?
I thought you said you couldn't eat raw fish.
The intersection where the accident happened is near here.
Who was your French teacher?
My brother is now in Australia.
I can't believe this has happened.
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
Do you mind if I turn down the TV?
We have plenty of wine.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
It is not surprising that he was elected mayor.
Nobody will know.
We all agree with you.
Stop fooling around!
He has done it before.
How do you think you'd look wearing that dress?
What do you mean?
I don't really want to bother you with my problems.
He died the next day.
I want to know what that is.
She struggled to get up.
Why don't you ever cook?
She devoted herself to him.
You don't have enough experience.
He promised to marry her.
I need some cash.
A fire broke out during that night.
They held hands.
You're going too fast.
He had a new suit made.
We owe part of our success to luck.
I'm asking you as a friend.
They didn't see anything.
I see you had to work late again last night.
It doesn't work yet.
Would you like it washed?
Tom and Mary were only thirteen when they first met.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
She was falsely accused.
We pitched the tent next to the river.
Tom had a blue coat on.
The flowers in the garden are very beautiful.
He's a filthy liar.
Where did you go to college?
The Titanic's maiden voyage didn't go so well.
They fought the measures in the courts.
I am working full-time at a bookshop until the end of September.
I hope this fine weather holds.
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
Do you know how they knew?
I can't control what happens.
I understand the problem.
I'll leave this with you.
Is that your house?
It is better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
I knew you'd come back sooner or later.
When I visited their apartment, the couple was right in the middle of an argument.
His appearance deceived me.
I looked in the window.
Are you the group leader?
He is in the kitchen.
It was unbelievable.
No one listened to me.
Why is this happening?
Can you please look the other way?
My brother-in-law is really egotistical.
Nobody knows it but me.
I don't have a ticket.
He is my colleague.
Tom shouldn't have borrowed Mary's car.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
How many children do you have?
What are you crunching on?
I quite agree with you.
You've taught us a great deal.
It's said that nothing is more precious than time.
How long did this take?
I didn't say you were crazy.
Please do not try this at home.
They can't fire you.
The cat ruined my sofa.
After her graduation from college, she went over to the United States.
You are her daughters.
The prize will go to the best student.
How do you spell your last name?
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
Please forgive me.
I'm not to be disturbed.
You should try to write more legibly.
Tell me this isn't happening.
Tom didn't arrive until it was already too late.
He doesn't drink anymore.
I want my bicycle back.
I wish that I could give you something.
How long have you been out of prison?
When will she return home?
She knelt beside him and asked him what his name was.
I take a bath every morning in the summer.
I'm as old as you.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
Come whenever you want to.
I may as well go now.
How many books do you have in your bag?
I'm not worried about Tom.
Do you think Mary's skirt is too short?
A car drew up in front of my house.
It occurred to me that my watch might be broken.
He is sick.
I appreciate your time.
Don't forget to stir the stew.
Don't you have an interesting face?
I want to know who sent you.
We all sang in unison.
Can you make it on time?
We're not going.
I sat at the front in order to hear the lecture clearly.
You didn't eat much lunch, did you?
I finally overcame my shyness and asked him out on a date.
Long, long ago, there lived an old man in a village.
Have you been out at all?
It was yesterday that he died.
Why should I go?
She teaches us French.
I don't go to school by bus.
Are you sure he can do this?
Let's decide together where to go first.
I guess I felt like eating something different.
He introduced his sister to me.
There are times when I'd like to be more like you.
The kids are driving me crazy.
He pressed the button and waited.
I want to get married and I want to have kids.
Just seeing it made me nervous.
She knows my wife.
Could you please do that for me?
I thought you'd gone home.
How about running?
I wonder if you ever think of me.
I don't hold grudges.
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my wife?
I don't like eggs.
This directly concerns Tom.
We walked up and down the streets of Kyoto.
Are you seriously thinking about getting a divorce?
Does it make a big difference?
I prefer coffee.
He gets hives when he eats eggs.
You're the prisoner.
I misspelled the word.
Do you recognize that man?
He lives as if he were a millionaire.
Don't worry. This won't happen again.
Get out of here.
He's looking good.
There was a lot of snow last year.
What's troubling you?
You will wish you had never seen it.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I felt scared.
He's been working all day long.
Tom has never been to a circus.
They won the kissing contest.
Tom and Mary got into their car.
There were no people in the village.
Tom seems to have lost his key.
Don't you want some ice cream?
We can't be sure.
Do you know how long they have been married?
Tom isn't like you.
What are the rules again?
This is no time for modesty.
Five gallons of regular, please.
He's fluent in Japanese.
You should consult a dictionary when you don't know the meaning of a word.
He worked for a rich man.
You were fantastic.
I was asked to wait here.
Why do we have to take it away?
I want to take a closer look at that.
May I visit you tomorrow?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
Airplanes land at airports.
No one is coming.
Are we ready to go?
Would you like to have tea with us this afternoon?
Is that why you're upset?
My father was an actor.
Everybody started to leave.
The style is nice, but do you have it in a different color?
As soon as she wakes up, we'll turn on the music.
Stick out your tongue.
We are all eager to know the truth.
A severe ocean storm hit the West Indies.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
I'm so full.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel a lot better.
I arrived safe and sound this morning.
Don't make me stay.
You've been busy, haven't you?
He fired most of his men.
What're you all dressed up for?
Mom bought a puppy for us.
I just want to make sure you live up to your end of the bargain.
Let's have a look.
Don't you remember anything?
You can't just walk away from this mess.
How come you're not the boss?
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
Tom is forgetful.
You're careful.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be recovered from radioactive waste material.
He did his best to be in time for the train.
As far as I know, she hasn't departed yet.
Let's see what happens.
Anyone can make a mistake.
I hadn't intended to work at this company this long.
His memory never ceases to astonish me.
I want to see more.
I never thought it'd be this hard to create an iPad app.
I appreciate all you've done.
What do you think of when you look at this photo?
I stayed at a nice hotel.
Don't mention it.
I feel like I'm thirty years old.
Iceland belonged to Denmark.
One must keep one's promises.
Why are you alone?
The boy looked into the room.
I'm eighteen.
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
The last thing I want to do is cause you any problems.
About what time?
Your efforts came to nothing.
Birds usually wake up early in the morning.
You have to go.
We're twins.
Don't let him do it alone.
I'm sorry, I don't buzz in people I don't know.
I did a bad thing.
I know you're not lying.
I think you know that's not true.
My best friend stole my boyfriend.
Make yourself at home.
He was laughed at in public.
He decided to rent his property to that company.
Are you ready for the trip?
It's my job to convince you.
I am familiar with your name.
The Mayor addressed a large audience.
Let's not do the work.
I am completely out of breath.
I take a bath every other day.
At what time did you hear the gunshot?
Is your watch correct?
This is not a good sign.
How old is your grandfather?
I was told to wait for a while.
I opened the door and saw two boys standing side by side.
I love the way you kiss.
It's been a terrible day.
It's really not that interesting.
I have been looking for you.
I think it's time for me to consult a lawyer.
Thank you, my dear.
To tell the truth, I felt lonely.
I want to give you the chance to do that.
I'm going to be a lawyer.
I need a drink.
I brought wine.
Are they displayed all through the year?
He was convicted on trumped up charges.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
I agree with you to some extent.
It's a good story.
You're not good at this.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
The issue is quite familiar to us.
She has a book.
He has been dead for five years.
He is anxious for her to come.
Contracts have already been negotiated.
The robot went out of control.
I got married 8 years ago.
Who am I speaking to?
My throat hurts when I swallow.
I was just trying to protect you.
He is my colleague.
You did say that.
That'll be all.
The cake got crushed by the jar of juice.
I know you're telling the truth.
You're all alone.
Let me pay for your coffee.
I saw him with my own eyes.
I hate paperwork.
I would never question his honesty.
It just doesn't make sense anymore.
I just want to be a good neighbor.
Our sphere of influence has expanded so much since then.
Please give me another chance.
That's a very personal question.
Let us do our job.
We plan to go hiking tomorrow.
I'll get in.
His sudden appearance surprised us all.
It was your own choice.
What's wrong with you?
The sky was clear when I left home.
Are you a Buddhist?
I'm glad you're here to help me with this.
My grades are above average.
Some of these young people have legs twice as long as mine.
I need to jump start my car.
You're a filthy liar!
The food is spoiled.
Why is snow white?
She knocked on the door.
Do you remember your grandfather?
He is very learned.
I know what they're doing.
What would you like?
They each received a present.
Don't you see what's happened?
Tom wears silk ties.
Are you happy right now?
It wasn't that big.
I feel faint.
People like Tom lie all the time.
I borrowed this book from him.
She bought him a camera.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
We noticed the man enter her room.
You are important.
I'm not sure why.
What's the hurry?
Most of my traveling companions were nice.
He bought a new car.
She introduced her sister to him more than two years ago.
Tom was knocked unconscious.
Is this seat free?
Reflect on what you have done.
French is difficult to learn.
Where have you been?
You may as well leave such a decision to your daughter.
He likes it when I do that.
The mail has arrived.
I did not know this.
When was the last time you spoke with Tom?
They were seen to go out.
That can't be denied.
I have to try.
Baby teeth are sharp.
She can't find her keys.
He acquired education late in his life.
I had to lend to him money.
In the United States, school buses are yellow.
I got an ink blot on this form.
She didn't let him touch her baby.
Keep to the left when driving.
My college has a dormitory.
I wonder if he's really sick.
Tom showed his room to me.
Come off it!
She has a book under her arm.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
Do you believe in guardian angels?
A glass of water, please.
I've been busy all week.
I didn't realize you were awake.
What are you working on?
I know this is true.
Can one of you open the door for me?
I'd say you did well.
It has been raining since yesterday.
Can't you keep your dog from coming into my garden?
You like rain, don't you?
The athletes trained hard every day to be at their best for the Summer Olympics.
Nobody likes you.
What book did you buy?
I'll do all the talking.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
She looked very beautiful in her new dress.
I thought you were trying to be funny.
Was he lying on his back?
I have some time.
The horse is mine.
This is a very scary moment.
They had different ideas.
It is no good talking about it.
I won't touch a thing.
Give me your money.
Nobody has made a decision yet.
I'll stop gambling.
The employees voted on the manager's proposal.
I know almost nothing about you.
What scared you?
My boss isn't satisfied with my report.
Would you mind if I went home early?
I'm very worried about your health.
Don’t post drunk pictures on Facebook or Twitter.
I'll be your teacher.
Is that what you really want to do?
Fill the jars with water.
All plants need water and light.
Poaching is illegal.
A comparable car would cost far more in Japan.
He ordered me to sweep the room.
As usual, he was the last to arrive at the theater.
She must have visited England last summer.
Is Tom alive?
Please don't blow your nose on the tablecloth.
Don't look so shocked.
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry?
I also went.
I'll show you around town.
My car is being repaired.
I left my baby in her care and went shopping.
I wonder if exchange students can join this club.
Don't listen to that man.
I thought I was going to faint.
We'll be there in plenty of time.
He is bound to pass the entrance examination.
I would prefer to speak to you in private.
Whose turn is it to make dinner tonight?
He donated a lot of money.
You know what they say.
I teach here.
We're under attack.
It was not my intention.
Do you have any Japanese beer?
We saw you.
Is there anything else I can do?
Come up here.
I'd like to hear you sing.
I know you must be afraid.
I'll take your coat.
We're too vulnerable.
He showed me his collection of stamps.
This showy dress isn't appropriate for me.
My heart was in my throat.
That's why I worry about you.
Where did the money go?
I don't have enough money to buy a new bicycle.
Pump up the tire.
His new book met with a favorable reception.
I feel cold.
I'll make all the arrangements.
I can't do this job alone.
He implied that something was wrong with his marriage.
I must have the wrong number.
I like your dog.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
This computer is yours, isn't it?
They drove the adults crazy.
I'm emotionally drained.
Six people applied for the job, but none of them were employed.
It's useless to try and resist.
This isn't a game.
Don't leave it up to chance.
Show me the way, will you?
I'd like to help you reach your goals.
I don't understand what he wants.
I'm going to ask for a new desk.
I couldn't remember his name.
What is your name?
Her life is in danger.
I have to hurry!
I know you considered me a close friend.
You need to reboot your computer.
You are a good person.
I'm bald.
She became a nurse.
You may go at once.
I almost missed the train.
I plucked a daisy for her.
Get rid of them.
The red lines on the map represent railway lines.
I can't help myself.
Get the box.
I saw him play baseball.
Please take note of that.
I can't just leave you here.
This is extremely confidential.
Who's working tonight?
He's a smooth talker.
I'm in love with you.
You will always be in my heart.
I arrived here yesterday.
It doesn't get any better than this.
Talk to my boss.
An extremely terrible thing happened to him.
You should get up early.
I bike to work.
Why did you listen to them?
Looks like I will become a dad.
Tom has lived in Boston for three years.
You promised me that you would make something for us to eat.
I didn't know you were awake.
Do you know what it's called?
Are you ready for the trip?
I hate this store.
He paused to have a cigarette.
We'll try even harder the next time.
We're not getting anywhere.
Minnesota's state bird is the mosquito.
Be proud of yourself.
You were my friend.
Your demands are unreasonable.
I was just going to write a letter.
The jury is deliberating.
Can you say that again?
I have some extra tickets for the concert.
Be kind.
That's the only thing that's important.
Don't act like a know-it-all.
I had a terrible dream.
How long do you plan on staying here?
Tom wasn't at the meeting.
Do you want to go in?
We met at the designated spot.
Tom is standing over there near the fireplace.
"Ah" is an interjection.
Our world is only a tiny part of the universe.
It was a case of mistaken identity.
What language do they speak in your country?
She prepared a wonderful meal for us.
Are any seats still available?
We're early.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
It occurred to me spontaneously.
I didn't mean to surprise you.
There's no sign of infection.
I am interested in Japanese history.
I don't want you to lose.
Tom is our best player.
Leave me alone!
You're not fast enough.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
Maybe it was just a nightmare.
It's more fun than studying.
They're really ugly.
Either stop talking or say something worth hearing.
What are you waiting for?
I want to watch what's on TV right now.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Today's my daughter's birthday.
This is awesome.
Life cannot exist without water.
Come quick!
Our destination is still a long way off.
You're not satisfied, are you?
Habits are difficult to break.
I ran outside.
Just give me what I want.
Tom said you told him to wait.
We entered into a serious conversation.
When did the robbery happen?
There was a list of available candidates.
Why don't you start by telling us where you went?
Compare the two carefully, and you will see the difference.
There is hope.
I have to borrow some money.
Get into your car.
I don't want to be different.
She gave me good advice.
The weather forecast is not necessarily reliable.
She displayed her talents.
I promise you I'll look after you.
That's what I'm worried about.
I got up early yesterday.
That's not an issue anymore.
You were the one who gave this to me.
No one speaks that language anymore.
I'll come with you.
Tom has charisma.
You were all a big help.
Could you spell your name, please?
I didn't know you were that good at French.
What did you do at that moment?
I want to make one thing perfectly clear.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
Take off your socks, please.
Are you sure they can do this?
Would you like some salad?
I have two tickets.
I don't like being on my own.
I wanted to know where the voice was coming from.
The dog started barking.
I have less money than you.
You can't have understood what he said.
My grandparents were born in the last century.
I sometimes dream of my mother.
Is tomorrow a holiday?
I lay down to rest.
I'll not be at home next Sunday.
The meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m.
We mustn't waste our energy resources.
The dog was frozen to death.
Cancer can be cured easily if it is found in its first phase.
I have a delivery to make.
We arrived first.
Have you ever seen her?
The days are longer in the summer.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
He accused her of having lied to him.
You can save your breath. There is no use talking to him.
What is it that you really want to say?
Are you sure you're not tired?
She demanded to see the manager.
They smiled.
How do you remember that?
I don't recall asking for your advice.
A spell of fine weather enabled us to get the harvest in safely.
I suggest you leave immediately.
It is what I would do.
You won't succeed.
Do you enjoy studying?
Do you think the shooting was accidental?
I'm very tired. I don't feel like taking a walk now.
I used to play alone when I was a child.
I didn't think you'd believe me.
Why don't you just ask your parents for money?
Tom was having car trouble.
The novels he wrote are interesting.
Are you saying I'm impolite?
They found each other.
You weren't even there.
I called him.
I don't believe you.
Have you heard from the rest of the team?
I wish the fedora would come back in style.
It looks like it's working again.
I read a lot of magazines.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
The children are growing tired.
Which films are showing now?
How are you connected?
They are very big.
I want to study German.
I bought a house.
Is there a mailbox near here?
Three other soldiers were wounded.
Go get changed.
There are many tourists in town.
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
Well, I must be going.
I can't let you go in there alone.
I really hope so.
He gave us quite a lot of trouble.
I think you might need me.
Tom seldom makes mistakes.
It's really not that bad.
All my friends like Tom.
That problem is too simple.
We should eat.
Don't touch that dial.
I felt exactly the same way.
I get off there, too.
Let's wait for another 5 minutes.
I smoked when I was young.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
It keeps you on your toes.
What on earth do you think you're doing?
You're bright.
I've never heard of that.
I haven't slept.
Eat whichever one you like.
I need inspiration.
Don't believe anything they say.
I love comic books.
You don't seem very pleased.
Isn't that just a brush fire?
Let's throw it away and start over with a clean slate.
Tell me where you've been.
There's no minimum wage here.
He came to see me yesterday afternoon.
I didn't receive even one letter from her.
I'm at the end of my rope.
We study the past for the sake of the future.
I will have him come.
Who is your friend?
The severely injured man was dead on arrival at the hospital.
I'm going to join the school orchestra.
You wouldn't understand. It's a girl thing.
Don't sound so surprised. You know I can do whatever I want to do.
I'd like to give you the key, but I can't.
This is your fate.
This house is too big for us.
What's your greatest fear?
I took that picture a week ago.
Put down your pencil.
Right now they're all sleeping.
No one can help you.
I don't want to ask you anything.
You're still growing.
The boy could not find his way out of the maze.
You don't have to hurry.
I cannot quite understand it.
Do you have small change?
I figured it out by myself.
We're so proud of you!
That's a good school.
What was the weather report?
You probably just have a cold.
Tom put thirty dollars on the table.
If it were not for the sun, we could not live at all.
What do you think of that?
What else can you tell us?
I was able to answer all the questions.
The world is full of fools.
Can I give you a little friendly advice?
This blue sweater is very pretty.
This CD belongs to my son.
What department do you work for?
I wouldn't care.
I'm a diabetic.
I don't know where it is.
I remember the letter.
She interrupted him while he was speaking.
They have already begun.
Which one will he choose?
Enjoy your vacation.
She complained to him about the noise.
I wish you'd talk to me.
We miss you very much.
This is kind of fun.
I felt guilty.
How did you come by this painting?
Are you sure about this?
You were my friend.
I'll cut your head off!
You're talented.
I get up early.
That house is very small.
I could do this all day.
They cut my hair too short.
Are you listening to me?
Who is that pretty girl?
She lost her way and on top of that it began to rain.
What do you see?
Kids can be so mean.
Funny, I don't remember that.
What a funny man!
I telephoned her at once.
I just want to be prepared.
I'm not sure I have enough time to clean my room before I go to school.
Give the book to whomever wants it.
She was about to leave the house.
I just wanted to make that clear.
I just remembered something I have to do before tomorrow morning.
Is it a compliment or an insult?
It was a wonderful feeling.
Tom never gave in to temptation.
My bicycle has a flat tire.
Do I look presentable?
You need to be more patient.
You're my enemy.
Do you want this shirt?
I'm very sad to hear that.
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye.
I ate a hamburger at McDonald's.
We talked about everything.
I don't know what to do next.
I don't like beer that much.
I forgot my email address.
He has a hard time remembering names.
The blouse is clean.
Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?
I hear it's buried under all that snow.
Which is your luggage?
I do not love him anymore.
Let's go to a Chinese restaurant.
Both of them started laughing.
I'm listening to music.
He had nothing to say, so he left.
I want you back today.
Give it your best shot.
Loosen up.
Am I interrupting anything?
Tom went pale.
I want you to be safe.
The sea is to fish what the sky is to birds.
I'm going to relax.
Will you show me the way to the bank?
My blood type is A positive.
Do you want some wine?
Let me take that.
They supported his right to speak freely.
Tom checked to make sure all the doors were locked before he went to sleep.
If you can't lick 'em, join 'em.
I want to make a complaint.
I'm not that cynical.
There are many rivers on that island.
Is this store open on Sundays?
Don't forget your money.
It is high time you spilled the beans.
I will be glad to help you anytime.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
You've been selected.
Have they spotted you?
Queen Elizabeth died in 1603.
You can't blame me.
I had a seizure.
Do you have anything to add?
Close the door after you when you leave the room.
I did see something.
I'll go if you insist.
The police caught the burglar red-handed.
You should've phoned.
He measured the length of the bed.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Fishing is prohibited here.
The problem is how to raise the funds.
I don't want to fight you.
He complains about one thing or another all the time.
She was amazed to hear the news.
His anger towards me has not softened.
I like shopping at the local farmers' market.
I want you to speak frankly.
It will go away by itself in two weeks.
It is difficult to convey the meaning exactly.
We were thoroughly satisfied with his work.
Do I have to dial the area code, too?
Can I get you something to drink?
I don't need your help.
I'm tough.
Do you think anyone can see us?
You'll make the same mistake if things continue in this way.
Do as you want.
Stocks hit a new high.
What time does the first train leave?
It was really incredible.
You're driving me nuts.
All of a sudden, the clerk lost his temper.
Those men are armed to the teeth.
Tom denied that he had stolen anything.
I have few friends.
No kidding?
Your drinking is starting to affect the performance of your duties.
He owns this land.
I'm not sure.
I hope you'll join us.
I still love you.
Give me a hand with this.
I may try again later.
They probably saw our ship come into port.
She interrupted him while he was speaking.
I've got one brother and two sisters.
It's not negotiable.
I don't want to kill you.
You can't have understood what he said.
If I pay you a dollar, we'll be even.
Are you all right now?
Could you take some pictures of us?
I don't think I can make it to your party.
She is engaged to a rich man.
I find that offensive.
I'm hungover.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
She has never seen it before.
Who is your favorite author?
Tell Tom I don't have his money.
Tom doesn't want to go to school today.
I had to do everything by myself.
Whatever will be, will be.
Come in already.
I just want to be left alone for a while.
What languages do they speak in Korea?
This is my first time, so I'm a little nervous.
Tell me what you eat, I'll tell you what you are.
What do these markings mean?
Let's see if I've got that right.
She became a great artist.
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
You do want that, don't you?
Do you really want to stay young forever?
After the fire, the smell of smoke in the air lasted for days.
You are very brave.
The accident happened because he wasn't careful.
Her name wasn't on the list.
I don't want to eat any more.
She stood close to her husband.
Do you like salmon?
I'm definitely going crazy.
Don't use slang if you can help it.
Dublin is in Ireland.
The population of London is much greater than that of any other British city.
I'm not planning anything.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I like to swim in the afternoon.
Go get a drink of water.
Can I stay here tonight?
I hope you're not alone.
Who should I believe?
Do you like me, too?
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
It's too far to walk to the station, so let's take a bus.
Tell me what to do here.
Sign the guest book.
He has been living here these ten years.
If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some.
Your boots are ruined.
I go to a driving school.
Tom is laughing.
The bus turned around the corner.
I think we make a good team.
This is a comfortable chair.
I only did my duty.
The dog was hit by a car.
Are you sure of your facts?
I will try it again.
Tell us what you want to do.
You don't have to tell me this.
She's a real hottie.
Why didn't you listen to me?
She was buried in her hometown.
There is an urgent need for more doctors.
Tom had to do it even though he didn't want to.
Do you feel like going out for a drive in the country over the weekend?
Do you want to go to the aquarium?
Whose pencil is this?
That's one question I can't answer.
I gave her all the money I had.
Opinions vary from person to person.
He thinks he knows everything.
He was successful in several areas.
Get a hold of yourself.
If it's all right with you, I'd like to stay for a while longer.
I have to go back to the office.
I really don't have a lot of money.
Somebody's having a good day.
It seems that no one knew the truth.
We're both insane.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Have you ever shot anybody?
I'd like to talk to someone about what I saw.
Let me tell you my side of the story.
He is very mean to me.
Do you think there's a connection?
You're wonderful.
I can see you're frightened.
I learned to drive a car and got a driver's license when I was eighteen.
My son won't listen to me.
What will you be doing at this time tomorrow?
Does he know me?
You're all racists.
Everybody makes mistakes, don't they?
He's a very fine musician.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
It's up to you and me.
I'm from France.
I have a computer.
This shop has more candy than that shop.
How much does the shirt cost?
Who were you talking to?
I'm not a fan.
I'll take those.
There's a lot to do.
Tom has a new girlfriend already.
I want to hear more about this.
I'm sorry, my father's not here.
It wasn't an accident.
I don't like sweet drinks.
I guess not.
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
I don't really know what to say.
We have a new puppy. He is about 12 weeks old.
At last, the truth became known to us.
Tom couldn't answer all of Mary's questions.
I have some extra tickets for the concert.
I had a premonition today.
Nobody noticed that the picture was hung upside down.
Did they go to the mountains?
You've got some nerve.
Take anything you want.
Are you still recovering from last night?
I hope you're well paid.
What a lovely day it is!
Tom doesn't like any sport.
Everybody is great.
Somebody's made a mistake.
The rain prevented me from going out.
I almost feel sorry for you.
Everyone was looking at me.
He was the only man.
I enjoyed talking with him.
Our boat approached the small island.
Hello, Tom. Good morning.
My aunt sent me a birthday present.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
You don't have to go unless you want to.
Did you call me up last night?
Turn right at the end of that street.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Have you seen my keys?
You told us she was kind and she really is.
Fortunately, she didn't die.
He suffered great losses.
You can see the ancient ruins in the distance.
I just want to let you know that I won't let you down.
He was burning up with fever.
He lived an unhappy life.
I'd love to be able to find more time that I could spend relaxing.
Would you like to talk to a lawyer?
We now come to the point.
Take a book from the shelf.
We've just finished breakfast.
I was on a trip to India.
Say which you would like.
Please don't forget to put a stamp on the letter before mailing it.
She didn't feel like eating lunch.
Competition is neither good nor evil in itself.
Did anyone see you there?
They were very kind to me.
He listened to the music with his eyes closed.
Tom probably went to Boston.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
Tom speaks French very fluently.
I love your house.
I brought these flowers for you.
There are around three thousand mosques in Istanbul.
The dog started barking.
What I really want to do is sleep.
I want to eat something.
Just tell them no.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
I grew up eating Japanese food.
I'm realistic.
I apologize for the delay in sending the agenda.
I can't believe he kissed you.
I left my address book in my room.
Are you still studying French?
Please use a pencil to write down your name.
I couldn't think of anything worse.
I guess I don't have a choice.
He has been studying for two hours.
I must object.
They almost got us.
I do not mince words.
It was so hot that I thought I was going to pass out.
Could you be more specific?
Everything went smoothly.
That is where you are wrong.
I don't think I could ever do that.
What are you going to do this evening?
I think it's time for me to buy my son a car.
I found out when we're supposed to arrive.
Tom scratched his name off the list.
I'm sick of fighting.
He denied having written to me.
No one knew how much Tom loved Mary.
I made a paper plane.
I was just messing around.
Any chance of us getting approved?
You may go anywhere you like.
You're correct.
She had long hair last year.
You can sit down now.
It's against the rules.
Let him in.
I want to know what you see right now.
Oh no!
It was only much later that I came to understand the importance of child education.
I saw you snickering.
That didn't take long.
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
Why did they hire you?
You're considerate.
I sure wish you would leave.
I had to walk here because my car broke down.
You're a traitor.
Would you consider taking care of my children next Saturday?
I've run out of money.
This is an express train. It won't make many stops.
The situation is growing serious.
Tom knows he has no choice.
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
Do they like wine?
I only have eyes for you.
You need to be more patient.
If it wasn't for modern medicine, I'd be dead right now.
I just don't want to believe it.
Can you really swim?
He's so stupid.
He waited until she came.
I need to renew my ID card.
Thank you all so much.
He has access to the American Embassy.
She doesn't like soccer.
My friend told me that he had bought a new watch.
Let's pretend this never happened.
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind yet.
I warned him not to be late.
You are the only one who can help me.
I didn't get much sleep last night so I was nodding off all day at work.
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
I want to know that what I'm doing is right.
Can I talk with you?
My uncle gave him a present.
We're perfectly safe.
He put on the red jacket.
We're very serious.
Are you free this afternoon?
You will have to study harder next year.
Few people were killed in the car accident.
Do you live alone?
We're engaged.
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
She decided not to attend the meeting.
Are you surprised?
Call me this evening.
I thought you might want to know.
No one heard anything.
That old bridge is anything but safe.
I deeply regret having caused the accident.
Try not to laugh.
She's eating for two.
I hiccup a lot.
I just want to know why.
I'm told you're a good teacher.
Everyone was apprehensive.
How did you know we were here?
His house is for sale.
Have you ever spoken to Tom in French?
I was upstairs.
You will save your father a lot of worry if you simply write him a letter.
Whoever did this was smart.
What do you have?
Please move the chair. It's in the way.
What's the difference?
I know it myself.
That's why I sent for you.
He wants to squish the bug.
Tom knows a girl named Mary.
This is a funny sentence.
I'll take those.
The sun is the brightest star.
I don't believe it.
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
Did they say what happened?
Tea with lemon for me, please.
I have to go to work now.
I am going to do it whether you agree or not.
They're talking.
That's peculiar.
Don't make so much noise.
Don't you just love it here?
The supermarket is open Monday through Saturday.
What would we do instead?
I'm delighted to meet you.
Nobody having anything more to say, the meeting was closed.
I thought you were older than me.
I've never felt this way about anyone before.
Don't make me hurt you.
The box has holes in it.
I am off duty tomorrow.
My father has lived in Nagoya for more than fifteen years.
His jokes had us in stitches.
My motorcycle broke down on the way.
I just got off duty.
I know how you feel.
Your hands need to be washed.
We insist that a meeting be held as soon as possible.
It is necessary to lose weight.
I was captured.
We saw smoke in the distance.
I think Tom may be dead.
I was involved in a petty argument.
I wish she had come last night.
I had a problem with my car on the way to work.
Please send me a reply as soon as you receive this mail.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
I was relaxed.
It's about time I was going home.
He threw a rock into the pond.
She surprised him when she arrived early.
You can always tell what any individual wants most by what he does.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
Are you really a princess?
People can easily tell the difference between them.
I really don't have enough money.
Have you ever driven a sports car?
I want you to listen carefully.
Why don't we go out and get drunk?
Is it too far to walk?
My car was stolen last night.
I don't think it'll rain, but I'll take an umbrella just in case it does.
They're very close friends.
I'm alone.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
I want to watch you dance.
I can't make it any clearer.
You're fearless.
I'm cured.
I found a nice place to have a picnic.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
I can't always understand everything you say.
The time will come when you will regret it.
Do you have a cellphone?
Will you drive me home?
She turned on the TV.
I don't feel so special.
There is no way of knowing where he's gone.
The kitten lapped up the milk I poured into the saucer.
A long time ago, there was a bridge here.
I'm your boyfriend, aren't I?
Didn't Tom go to Mary's house?
You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
How long are you planning to stay here?
Drinks are on me.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as I arrive.
Something's on your mind, isn't it?
I deactivated my Twitter account yesterday.
Come along with us.
You're not special.
You must be kidding!
A big earthquake occurred in India yesterday.
You think I'm scared, don't you?
Do you know of a good motel in the area?
He gave her a piece of paper.
Good job!
Hey, you! What are you doing?
A small gain is better than a great loss.
This stays between you and me.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
Don't phone her now.
My favorite color is brown.
They got into the train.
I saw you outside.
Put them on the table.
Do you know something I don't know?
Please don't ever do that again.
It's a good thing.
I don't think this is for you.
Don't be afraid to talk to him.
I thought you might want to come along.
Does anyone care?
She stole a lot of money from him, so now she is in prison.
What year were you born?
I want one, too.
The wound has not healed yet.
The bird's wing was broken.
You will miss the train if you don't hurry.
I don't think we should do that.
They heard it on the radio.
It's no secret.
Are you sure that's necessary?
Are you hurt?
I respect you more than anyone.
Here or to go?
That is my own affair.
We're still vulnerable.
May I shave your sideburns?
This child's mother is an announcer.
This animal is friendly.
What he says makes no sense at all.
Many Americans wanted a gold standard.
You're very clever.
He enjoyed those visits.
I told you it was going to be cold here.
We did not expect him to finish the task in so short a time.
I don't remember her name anymore.
Tom believed that John was his brother.
He helped an old lady get up from her seat.
Put me through to the boss, please.
I couldn't speak.
Are you busy now?
Tom isn't really in love with Mary.
You should brush your teeth after every meal.
The sun has gone down.
He took off his glasses.
Stay back.
Presently the plan is still in the air.
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up.
Count up to thirty.
I can see it in your eyes.
I'm armed.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
I'd like to ask you a question, but if this is a bad time, I can come back at another time.
The thief got away with the money.
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
Did you enjoy yourself?
I think you need this.
Let me give you a hug.
He is good at driving.
Why did you lie?
Just forget it.
Be kind to little animals.
Is this radio yours?
No pain, no gain!
Here it is.
You should have come a little earlier.
Shut the door, please.
Fasten your seat belt, please.
No one has ever said such things to me.
She looked out through the hole.
I'm not panicking.
They voted.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
Can we trust Tom to do that?
Is everybody here?
Since he was dressed in black, he looked like a priest.
He got hooked on drugs at a young age.
Smoke poured out of the chimney.
He held out his hand and I took it.
I've got it right here.
My brother makes it a rule to look over the newspaper before going to his office.
She scrubbed the floor of the kitchen with a brush.
Tom washed the apple before he ate it.
I'm certainly not your friend.
It's Wednesday.
I wanted to show you this.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd just done what I told you.
Do what he tells you.
I don't like long drives.
I hate fanatics.
It wasn't possible for the boy to swim across the river.
When Tom opened the door, he saw Mary standing there with a six-pack and a pizza.
Kids love pasta in tomato sauce.
Oops, I did it again.
I hung my coat in the hall closet.
What did I leave behind?
In our society, there are both honorable people and swindlers.
Don't waste your time and money.
Show us around.
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
I thought you quit drinking.
I thought it best for him to say nothing about the matter.
The reason is that I want to be an English teacher.
They were afraid of the big dog.
I want to know now.
I'm from England.
We have finished lunch.
How did it all begin?
Something is wrong with my typewriter.
Tom washes his hair almost every day.
The cat sat on the mat.
He knows how to swim.
The Shinano is longer than any other river in Japan.
He is almost six feet tall.
The cat scratched my hand.
Tom filled out the application form.
Some of the girls laughed.
I'm feeling good.
I invited all my friends.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
This is not going to end well.
Help me out.
It seems as if you are the first one here.
He wants to go.
Have we met?
It's great for families.
I'm willing to take care of your children, if you want me to.
I found the bed very comfortable.
Haven't you had your dinner?
The ship sank with all her crew on board.
I will make some tea.
Minorities are despised in many countries.
There is a time for everything.
Not every student has a dictionary.
I recommend it highly.
We did all we could do.
The dog stopped barking.
He works for an American company.
I was born during the Cold War.
Please let me know the schedule beforehand.
I thought I was alone.
Tom began putting on his shoes.
The traffic accident prevented me from catching the train.
She is no longer the cheerful woman she once was.
I must go alone.
The explorers made their way through the jungle.
How do you feel about it?
Do you want me to shuffle the cards?
I can't bring myself to eat anything.
When did you find out?
You need to be more attentive in class.
I hurried home.
That's very considerate of you.
You're good.
May I use this?
I have already read today's paper.
The problem is you're not patient enough.
Wouldn't that be something?
You're the only one for me now.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
There's no salt.
It's actually not that difficult.
I think you're wrong.
How are you going to do that?
I wonder what Tom thought of it.
Do you have safety deposit boxes?
The leader of the party is a famous scientist.
She urged him to study harder.
You don't seem so smart.
Can I take a picture of you?
Hey, it's not so bad.
I confessed my sin.
My father is repairing my broken bicycle.
Do you think it's possible for me to ever sound like a native speaker?
I outrank you.
I have no insurance.
He had no sooner arrived than he was asked to leave.
I wish you had been there.
I gave you fair warning.
I hate my roommate.
I study French at home.
Do you have something for me?
Why are you so arrogant?
She found the key to my heart.
Tom never did it again.
I'm astonished by her cleverness.
Be seated.
The boy caught the cat by the tail.
I was busy cooking.
I've only used it once.
My father works in a factory.
Tell me how I can help you.
He never touched wine.
He's the one who touched me.
She didn't want him to die.
Tom grew up in a working-class family.
I tried to open the door, but I couldn't since it was locked.
I have been to London twice.
She fell down and broke her left leg.
I just can't help it.
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
Let's go by taxi.
He broke them.
She's been practicing piano for a year and can play the piano somewhat.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
Can I talk to you for a second, please?
You need to be more careful from now on.
I give you everything you ask for, but you never seem satisfied.
Please be careful.
Keep your hands off my bicycle.
Don't eat the oysters.
What does PTA stand for?
Who does this belong to?
He's always worrying about his daughter.
Put your hands up in the air!
I'm relieved to hear that.
The parents will be invited to the school celebration.
Go right ahead.
I don't speak German.
I don't have much time now.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
I don't want to do your dirty work.
The apple tree has a beautiful blossom.
My father is a doctor.
Let's sit down here.
Tom is mad at us.
He left after me.
I think you should leave.
It's just too soon.
Tom has a beard.
I'm getting old.
My mother is making dinner.
Let's play chess another time.
My mother is crazy.
"Are you a teacher?" "Yes, I am."
Do you want us to try prying this door open?
You must come every six months for a check-up.
Do you like my new clothes?
Tom's dog is a pretty good swimmer.
No one believes that anymore.
Tom caught a big fish.
Please close the door behind you.
I feel more confident now.
We don't need your money.
Don't just stand there, say something.
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?
He finally got his wish.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Someone must have left the window open.
Did it hurt?
You're the only person I know who can help me.
He will come down soon.
He contributed a lot of money to the charity.
We had to stop.
Is this really happening?
Don't you think that's a bit weird?
She introduced me to him at the party.
Wait. I can't walk that fast.
Well, you've convinced me.
You're very talented.
His comments about the book were favorable.
We may have missed the bus.
Don't tell the others, OK?

Please stop laughing.
Had he been there, would you have wanted to come?
I want to do this alone.
She left the window open.
I don't know where to wait for her.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
At that time, she was a student at Yale.
That's cheating.
Don't go near the dog.
You said you were happy.
My sister was robbed of her bag on her way home last night.
I think it's time for me to give her a ride home.
It's been a while since I've seen you.
I'm not sure what I want to do.
Are you listening to me?
She was a genius in mathematics.
We're starting to question what we thought we knew.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
She's giving each child two apples.
He removed his sunglasses.
How could you do that?
Visiting Tom was a good idea.
I thought that he was angry.
It's time for a break.
Be careful.
What're you drinking?
You're cruel.
Should we continue?
I'll look after your child while you are away.

Could you find out how to get there?
That's real funny.
I want to go over a few things with you.
Tom has until Monday to decide.

What is your problem?
I changed my hairstyle.
When does he come?
How did you vote on that matter?

She forgot that she had promised to call him last night.
From personal experience, I know that any encounter with him will leave a bad taste in your mouth.
Is there something you wanted to say?
How come she hung up on you?
You should have been more prudent.
I hate that you have to be here.
First, let's talk about what Tom did.
Tom isn't going to forget that.
I can't go, nor do I want to.
We know him.
I had no choice but to accept the offer.
You really annoy me.
We're going shopping.
The files are missing.
They had no alternative but to retreat.

Be seated.
Smoking stinks.
You're too old for me.
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't do that.
Would you mind turning down the volume?
They arrested her.
He was not happy about it.
This looks good.
They're going to try.
Is he a friend of yours?
I work out to stay in shape.
That doesn't add up.
Can I write it that way?
Tom looked interested.
I'm not photogenic.
We want Tom to know he can come home.
Let's take it down a notch.
He gave her an engagement ring last night.

I wish you good luck.
You're weird.
You may sit.
I taught Tom French for three years.
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
If only I had taken your advice.
I think it's time for me to say goodbye.

I didn't think it would matter.
Are you through with your breakfast?
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
Just ignore it.

Look at that red building.
May I visit an art gallery?
Everything goes wrong when I leave.
He was playing the piano.
It's getting late.
Let me help you.
We'll all be there.

I looked at my watch.
Let's ask the boy who lives next door.
Last year saw a big political change in Japan.
Would you mind lending me your car?
She advised him to be more careful.
What do you want it for?
I am sure that he is an honest man.
He said his father was ill, but that was a lie.
What's your native language?
Please write down your name.

I'm tired, but I'll study hard.
Don't trust him, no matter what he says.
How tall you are!
Yesterday I helped my father.
I'm sure you have other skills.
Please do whatever you think is necessary.
It is doubtful whether this will work.

I don't even have one.
The chances are that the bill will be rejected.
It was harder than I thought.
You can sit down if you want.
What did Tom really want?
The present government has many problems.
They don't care.
It's something new.
He blew the deal.
I really appreciate it.
Tom isn't dangerous.
I can't make that kind of promise.
I don't like coffee.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
I forgot to tell you who would meet you at the station.
It's quite natural for him to think so.
She was making tea.
My daugther wants a kitten.
I want you to come with us tonight.
You're so wrong.
I was slightly surprised.

When he arrives in Tokyo, I'll call you right away.
I wrote a letter to my parents at home.
She is two years younger than me.

If she'd known the results, she'd have been shocked.
The same goes for Tom.
She doesn't need to work.
He's now a college student.
Tom and Mary laughed.
No one got sick.
He was born in a small town in Italy.
Why did you lie to me?
Tell them what you're doing here.
His crime deserved the death penalty.
Somebody stole my car.
At last, she hit on a good idea.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
She was educated by her grandfather.
This place is worth visiting twice.
Stop being so nice.
The teacher dismissed his class when the bell rang.
As soon as he graduated, he went to work in his father's general store.
Who's your French teacher?
I'm not in favor of such a plan.
Give me your gun.
I just don't want to be left alone.
I'm not sure what happened.
I think we need more coffee.

She's Tom's sister.
How did you get into my house?
I wish I could make up for lost time.

Take a break.
I'll take care of this.
Write in the date yourself.
Don't forget your bag.

Can you supply me with all I need?
She sat next to me.
I know what you did.
Could we make this a priority?
Lawyers are all liars.
Let me go!
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I think I understand the pressures you are under.
I have no idea what you mean.
There is nothing that can't be bought with money.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
I paid for these tickets.
You're the only person that I can trust.
Did you tell Tom why you're here?
Unfortunately, I missed all the fun.
She turned down his invitation.
I learned that a long time ago.
Hasn't he looked at himself in a mirror?
Did I hurt his feelings?
I love the way Tom thinks.
Is there another way to get there?
How would you describe yourself?
I should've expected it.
The teacher has three times as many books as I do.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
I felt the same way.
This is hers.
Would you give me a discount?
She put on her new dress for the party.
They went into the woods for a picnic.
I didn't need to paint the fence.
I think we should quit.

I have no idea what I'm doing.
The man died of cancer.
We've been invited to a costume party.
I'm not going to allow that.
We have to do better.
She met the man of her dreams.
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
You can go there.
The heater is warming up the room.
That's my idea.
Draw a circle.
Wow! That's cheap!
The car was stuck in the mud.
Did you win the race?
I'm out of ammo.
I wonder if you are truly happy.
Aren't you cold?
Is it serious?
Is your watch correct?
I have difficulty in understanding him.
What does this word mean?
You're talented.
What did I just tell you?
She's a member of a sorority.
I owe my success to you.
Don't expect me to help you with your homework.
We weren't doing anything!
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
This is for you.
I don't know what else to tell you.
That's really sad.
I saw it.
They did not clap for us.
I'm not strong.
Get a job.
Every action has its consequence.
I'm available.
No, that's not true.
Should I come?
Did I embarrass you?
I could never hurt you.
I took the medicine.
Hot weather will continue, so please watch out for food poisoning.
He's a bit drunk.
I'd like to apologize.
Severe weather frightens people.
I don't know how to pronounce his name.
We haven't had a price increase in the last five years.
Is this one the bus for Oxford?
Can rabbits swim?
I reconsidered your proposal.
You'd better not see her now.
I thought I recognized you.
I only speak a smattering of Japanese.
It's at the back of the building.
Sit down and take it easy for a while.
Let's eat before we go.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
Don't try to pull a fast one on me!
He's hungry and thirsty.
I felt responsible.
That was no ordinary storm.
What's not to like?
Sing the song once more, please.
He is a nice person.
I succeeded in my first attempt.
This house will rent easily.
You are taller than she is.
Who did you come with?
I feel giddy.
Let me treat you next time, then.
Sometimes when it's very cold, I can't get my car to start.
School is a waste of time.
Help me!
You're very nice.
You are a doctor.
It's good to get up early in the morning.
How could you say something like that?
We have a colleague in Spain.
I'm beginning to get used to doing this.
It's out of the question.
He was killed in the war.
I'm not in a rush.
Did you buy a nice bicycle?
I don't want you to go back.

You'll forget about me someday.
I've been thinking about you.
Either you or I have to go there.
Tell them what you told me.
They left it under the table.
You're not alone.
I fully understand your concerns.
It's so exciting.
Sorry to bother you.
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
Is there a woman in your life?
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
As far as I know, he is not married.
Look at the map on the wall carefully.
I just said I didn't want to talk about it.
The small boy slowly made some new friends.
I need you on my side.
That's absolutely right.
He goes there every day.
Everything I said was true.
Are you ready to fly?
Do you feel like having a drink?
I like English, too.
Let's take it step by step.
You've come too early.
I'm looking after myself.
I apologize for my rudeness.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
I'd like to see you again.
Your name's further down the list.
There is to be no fraternizing with the enemy.
They made fun of my clothes.

I know what they are.
I think I'll stay in Boston for a few more days.

We weren't able to buy tickets, so we didn't go to the concert.
Every crime must be punished.

Don't take it personally.
He's so young.
The dictionary on the desk is Tom's.
I am going to bed.
You look just like my sister.
There was a ton of pressure on him.
I was moved by his tears.
I admit that I was careless.
It's not hopeless.
I know he is busy.
Here I come.
I just can't remember.
He was present at the meeting.
Please stay as long as you wish.
Do you have a red pencil?
It's the next logical step.
I go to the library at least once a week.
I've never been to Istanbul.
They don't get along together.
What do you say you join me for dinner?
I have a weird neighbor.
I was warned.
I said he could go.
I think we'll make it if we hurry.
It seems that Tom is unable to solve the problem.
The flowers brightened up the room.
She speaks Hebrew with her mother and Polish with her father.
Tom is extremely generous.
I do have a plan.
Keep in touch.
They decided to settle in a suburb of London.
I just don't understand.
We can't give up now.
It would mean a great deal to me if you would stay.
The peace talks ended in failure.
What don't you have?
He was wearing glasses.
Do you play any instruments?
I'm not scared of you anymore.
She failed every time she tried.
I think his opinion is very important.
I want to write my girlfriend a love letter in French.
Will you join our club?
Who's not coming?
You're just being diplomatic.
Let's continue the game after lunch.
I am going to my room, where I can study.
My son likes books about animals.
He broke the machine by using it incorrectly.
He gives an apple to the teacher every day.
He has started acting strangely.
I'll make a phone call.
She hurt her foot when she fell off her bicycle.
Tom has decided to take the day off.
I can hardly hear you.
We work every day but Sunday.
How did you come by this painting?
I don't plan on being here that long.
The house is painted white.
All of a sudden, three dogs appeared in front of us.
I see you are ready.
Keep the window closed.
No one said anything like that.
As soon as the door opened, they ran away.
Do you also like jazz?
I want things the way they were.
I've been busy all week.
I have no control over it.
You must do this alone.
Tom waited more than an hour.
Are we ready to go?
It's crowded today.
Let's get this party started!
Can I help you find something?
She just laughed the matter off.
I just followed the recipe.
He laid on his back.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I'm in love with you.
Which doctor is attending you?
I just don't want to lose you.
He exposed himself to danger.
You haven't eaten anything yet, have you?
Don't screw it up!
I hope this is resolved quickly.
I had difficulty in making myself understood in French.
I'd like a glass of beer.
I'm not quite ready yet.
I'd like to have a word with you.
I lost the watch.
Please reconsider.
She was late because of the heavy traffic.
It looks like you've lost ten pounds.
I'll check with you later.
There is more water than is needed.
My muscles were aching and I was tired.
The water pipe burst.
They're looking for you.
These hats are the same size.
I'm not done with you yet.
Tom can play the piano well.
Are you free now?
He had a new suit made.
I suspected that something like this might happen.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
I remember that guy.
We aren't very hungry yet.
Thanks for the advice, Tom.
I have never been to America.
I'm one of your students.
I shouldn't have to say anything.
Tom looked at it more closely.
The canteen had not a drop of water left.
My daughter's your age.
Since she got her braces, I've hardly seen her smile.
They all deserve to die.
You get out only what you put in.
I made them myself.
I followed the recipe.
This is my dog.
It's not easy to thread a needle.
On the plate was a piece of chicken, a potato and some green peas.
That's why I called you.
What are your weekend plans?
What is that thing in your right hand?
The two countries will negotiate a settlement to the crisis.
I don't like feeling so powerless.
She put on her sweater.
There's something happening here that I don't quite understand.
Will you give me something to drink?
We'll be making an announcement shortly.
I don't understand your question.
People came from all over.
Tom died in Autralia in 2013.
Thanks for your explanation.
Give me all the details.
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
I don't know how, but you did it.
How did you think it would go?
The party is in full swing.
She tied him to the chair.
You're productive.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
We heard a noise in the bedroom.
I made these.
Why didn't you apply for the job?
You reap what you sow.
Tom didn't remember where he'd put his pen.
You just screwed up.
You don't hear me complaining, do you?
I missed supper.
Everyone was happy.
I would like to go to Japan.
He came at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
I heard him go out.
She wants to be a designer.
He was late because of the snow.
Do you want anything?
Some photos were printed in black and white.
Frankly, I don't like that man.
You don't know what Tom is capable of.
The door clicked shut.
I don't know why I said that.
I want you to know what's true and what's not.
He was re-elected mayor.
I hope you're happy.
That is surprising.
Tom said that he had been cleaning the house all day.
The important thing is that we're together.
We wouldn't stand a chance.
I just love beautiful women.
Japan has a lot of beautiful mountains.
The stockholders are making money hand over fist.
I can't. It's too big.
My aunt lives in New York.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
The students like it.
Have you told your mom?
I'm not young.
A car was coming in this direction.
Tom lowered his sword.
You did well, Tom.
It was all gone.
I'm bad at swimming.
Do you mind if I sit?
He lives in Nagasaki.
You need to rest.
He has no real friends.
My camera is waterproof.
I didn't want to involve you.
Tom talked too much and let the secret slip.
He felt himself being lifted up.
Do I have to pay you?
Jump as high as you can.
Stop the car here.
I opened one eye.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
You ought to know better at your age.
I don't know much else.
She doesn't speak to me.
I'm sorry, but I can't answer right away.
I apologize for that.
I never saw you.
Let's clean up this mess.
I never thought it would end like this.
I'm ready to leave now.
Digital music is becoming more and more popular.
Do you like playing sports?
I am of the opinion that she is right.
I don't know what's happening.
I need you in my life.
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
I wrote this song just for you.
I'll leave it up to you.
Your cat is driving me crazy.
Country people are traditionally suspicious of strangers.
Please don't be mad at me.
Are you on dope?
That worked.
I thought we weren't going to go there.
She hardly talks at all.
I don't know if I'm staying yet.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
I wish that I could give you the money you need.
You don't get enough exercise.
Can you help me?
My friend helped me.
I want to be able to walk down this street without worrying about getting shot.
I never did it again.
What was in it for you?
The weather was gorgeous.
Tom explained the project to Mary.
This is not my first time.
Both of my parents have passed away.
Don't worry about others.
She assisted her brother with his homework.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
Someone screamed.
Were you with anyone?
You can stay if you like.
Everyone started laughing.
Not every community was affected.
He has been busy since this morning.
What's in the bag?
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
Don't do anything you don't want to do.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
Nobody can solve this problem.
Do you like robots?
She's putting the children to bed.
How many days will it take if I send this as registered mail?
I have had it.
I'm greedy.
We're plastered.
How many of you are there now?
I never said you were lying.
I haven't seen you for a while.
Somebody's going to notice you.
Tom doesn't have a cat. However, Tom does have a dog, doesn't he?
They started to sell a new type of car in Tokyo.
Do you have a copy?
Could you speak a little louder please?
How much time do you spend with your spouse?
Fish, please.
It feels weird, doesn't it?
The egg is a universal symbol of life and rebirth.
Are you for or against the plan?
Nobody likes you.
Prizes will be awarded at the end of the contest.
My mother never gets up early.
He and I are classmates.
How about running?
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
I used to have a girlfriend.
There's a bus stop close to our school.
She accused him of stealing her money.
I have something very important to tell you.
Tom is sleeping in his bedroom.
What's the whole story?
He's kind of cute.
Get out of my room.
You've been great.
His dad calls him Tom.
I can't believe people really eat that stuff.
You're very good.
He built on his father's fortune.
Do you have some money?
I knew something Tom didn't know.
I will not help you.
He liked that.
He left without saying goodbye.
Apart from his parents, no one knows him very well.
The fishermen took photos of their catch.
I don't like that name.
Tom kissed Mary good night.
It won't take that long.
Would you like to take a recess?
I wish you the same.
I am the chosen one.
Give me a coffee, please.
I know exactly where I want to go.
Yesterday, Mary cleaned the house and washed clothes.
I'm a photographer.
If you want to achieve the kind of success that I think you do, then you'll have to study harder.
Quit acting like a baby.
Do you listen to the radio at home every day?
The mystery surrounding his death was played up by the media.
You are important.
I really do like Christmas.
Can anyone believe you?
The need for reform in Italy is enormous.
I feel awkward in his presence.
Stop deluding yourself.
Here is a letter for you.
We're stuck.
The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.
Don't send me home, please.
You'll get over this.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
We've endured three wars.
Did you pay for those shoes?
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
Let her replace it.
He is my close friend.
They have plenty of time.
They have to clean the room.
I don't even know where to start.
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
Take a nap.
Men know nothing about women.
You're skinny.
Don't let the cat escape. Close the door!
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
It is sunny today.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
He's everybody's friend.
Water is important.
Well, are you coming?
He speaks English better than I do.
"May I go with you?" "Of course."
Tom takes very good care of his car.
I want you to remember this moment.
He warned us not to enter the room.
Don't look down on others.
At this beer hall, you can order beers up to one liter in size.
You are not Japanese.
You've gone too far.
What is he after?
Science begins when you ask why and how.
Tom set a trap.
You look upset.
I'm glad I hired you.
I have been wanting to ask you a question.
Where's your other brother?
She's a powerful witch.
Everybody should have a purpose.
It was quite pleasant.
Don't put the saddle on the wrong horse.
I've got a lot of good friends.
You stick out like a sore thumb.
Open the windows.
What did I tell you?
The young lady carried a child in her arm.
They want more.
I remember my mother teaching me the alphabet.
I don't know when the meeting started, but it started at least thirty minutes ago.
I find you very attractive.
It's quite plain that you haven't been paying attention.
Tom fainted as soon as he saw the needle.
Let's treat everybody fairly.
The food was great in Italy.
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
This wood won't burn.
We missed the deadline.
I used to go fishing with my father when I was a child.
I just want to make it up to you.
Tom has three mobile phones.
I was paraphrasing.
He weighed the stone in his hand.
I awoke to find a bird in my room.
I'm drunk.
Tom didn't tell me her name.
You are not Japanese.
I'll be happy to work with you.
I think you're interesting.
What's the matter with you?
He likes me and I like him too.
How long does it take?
I find that I get the best flavor by grinding fresh peppercorns.
You may eat as much as you want to.
It wasn't any bigger than a soccer ball.
Are they taking good care of you?
We have enough.
That's not a bad guess.
She teased him.
You have the same camera as mine.
Make a decision and make it with the confidence that you are right.
Tom's gotten fatter since the last time I saw him.
I'd never hire Tom.
Could I get you to update this data for me?
It's a weapon.
It won't hurt, I promise.
Where can I buy snacks?
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
He takes vitamins.
Need anything else?
It's your bedtime.
I like this model.
What position do you hold?
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Why don't you run for student council?
My wife is cooking right now.
My teacher encouraged me to fulfill my ambitions.
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
What is it that makes you think that way?
It's ironic.
This is what is called a 'present' in some countries and 'bribery' in others.
Come over!
I never use this anymore.
I think Tom is sleeping.
Tomorrow, I have plans to go to Tokyo.
He thinks of nothing but himself.
I'm a normal guy.
Help me out, would you?
I met him in Tokyo by chance.
He acquired French when he was young.
You hit the center of the target.
Are you talking to yourself again?
Stand up straight.
There's a policeman outside who wants to see you.
My doctor told me that I needed to lose some weight.
He whistled for his dog.
I didn't cry.
You're very sophisticated.
I'm reading an interesting book.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
What are you doing buying a house that expensive?
They saw us yesterday.
Let go of me.
I like talking to people.
Tom can't read without his glasses.
Since he was tired, he went to bed early.
That's all she wrote.
Do you mind if I come in?
He's sure that he'll pass the next exam.
I'm pleased with his performance.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
The poor young man finally became a great artist.
We have something very important that we need to discuss.
We all breathed a sigh of relief.
Are you sure he can do this?
I don't care much for coffee.
Here is your dog.
That was awesome.
You're very emotional.
It looks like it's going to rain.
You're wearing my pajamas.
Do you have a credit card?
I have an earache.
We're not being sued.
The day is almost over.
I've got blisters on my feet.
You'd better wait for the next bus.
I don't think you really want to know.
Thank you for making it so easy.
It's a small town.
I dealt with it.
Does he like China?
I like having people around me.
I thought you did fairly well.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Try to look busy.
I'll fix it up all right.
I'm very comfortable.
Times are changing.
We've finished the work, so we may as well go home.
Have a safe journey.
Can you show me where I am on this map?
Who would you like to speak to?
We need this report by tomorrow.
I've already been shot twice.
Without your encouragement, I would have given up this plan.
There is an apple under the desk.
I didn't get enough sleep.
Speech is silver, silence is golden.
That is his house.
Is there somebody you want to call?
I helped my father yesterday.
You need this.
Both you and I are students.
He was welcomed everywhere.
I'm helping people to buy things online.
Do I need to go to the dentist's?
You have very nice lips.
Don't touch the stove.
I'm making a documentary.
Do you have the painting?
Are you homeless?
Where's the toilet?
You're very angry.
He wants a new car.
I roll my own cigarettes.
What exactly don't you get?
She has brown eyes.
Where are you living now?
I gave up smoking six months ago.
I don't know how to persuade Tom to help us.
If you run into trouble, I'll help, and so will my father.
It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
We took shelter under a tree.
It seems quiet enough.
I've always trusted Tom.
He is able to speak ten languages.
Tom and Mary aren't alone.
Was I wrong?
My parents are crazy.
We should be on our way.
I like playing with my dog.
He spoke with a softness characteristic of southerners.
He will have left here by the time you return.
I first met him three years ago.
It's already done.
My mother is sick in bed.
You have a point.
He explained it in detail.
The worst is already over.
Children under thirteen years of age are not admitted to this swimming pool.
Add one teaspoon of paprika.
The house has been empty for years.
I thought it was stupid.
I want my bicycle back.
You should have gotten up earlier.
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
They tried to cheer me up.
You can use a dictionary for this exam.
What do you say?
What are you implying?
What are some foods you usually eat with a knife and fork?
Thank you for greeting me.
He left me the keys.
Am I supposed to thank you?
They caught him playing a trick on his sister.
I think we may have met somewhere before.
We used to be best friends.
That was everything I had.
Tom looks older than he is.
A new hotel will be built here next year.
I talked to everybody.
Your question has no answer.
Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
All I know is that she left last week.
I hear from him once a month.
Tom claims that he has never killed anyone.
Meet me in the hot tub.
I can't wait any longer.
It's easier than it sounds.
How do you know for sure?
We had no choice but to call the police last night.
I have a bad pain here.
Take out the trash.
Maybe it's not possible.
They look like they're having fun.
What I wanted was water.
I cannot agree to your proposal.
Don't believe anything they say.
I'd like to die of old age.
I’ve started learning Esperanto.
I'm all ears.
The parents are playing a game with their children.
He is not an American.
We shouldn't confuse solitude with isolation. They are two separate things.
We were all happy.
You are good.
I'm glad to hear that your sister is out of danger after her operation.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I want to buy ski boots.
My parents made me go there.
I just want your love.
I want to ask you a big favor.
He is giving me a hard time.
He rarely went there.
Everything was stolen.
They don't work with us anymore.
It isn't locked.
It's your responsibility to do that.
They were waiting for the gate to open.
I can't understand why you are so critical of him.
He was clearly embarrassed.
Let us out.
His hobby is painting.
Why would you want me?
Only young children and old fools tell the truth.
Is Tom from Boston?
He has been sick for a week.
Everyone was alert.
These are gifts for my friends.
They bought a box of cookies.
I like your tie.
He voted for the proposal.
I have to be there by 7:00.
I am tired of listening to his long speech.
I am up to my neck in work.
I thought I had a month to finish this.
Where is your father?
I'll handle this.
I am cooking now.
Tom tasted the wine.
We're staying.
What was the cause of the explosion?
Mother insists that I should eat more vegetables.
She continued with the work.
Tom doesn't like being criticized.
Tom took a shower.
She skimmed through the register to see if her name was in it.
I don't want to go to bed yet.
You're in a strange mood today.
I certainly would like a refund.
Close the window.
What was it that he was looking for?
I regret having said so.
I thought she wouldn't notice that he wasn't here.
Let's split.
She has gone to Italy.
We wanted you.
Whose book is this?
Tom couldn't do something like that.
It's not for everybody.
You're silly.
I could've done that.
You should lower your standards.
She went out without saying goodbye.
Come as you are.
Who are you trying to impress?
The pickpocket disappeared into the crowd.
It feels like I've known you forever.
We heard a gunshot.
I enjoy a challenge.
I've got no worries.
I left it unlocked.
Who is calling, please?
I know what you're probably thinking.
I was called on in English class.
What is the weather like today?
Don't make me say it.
They're crazy.
I want to take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the governor.
Why didn't you call me last night?
I know I'm not the brightest girl in the world.
Tom's wife doesn't know Mary's husband.
Where exactly are you?
I wish you hadn't found me.
I studied for one hour.
Getting up at six o'clock is okay for me.
We went to the café that I told you about.
Do you want me to walk you home?
Have you read the book Tom bought for you?
How long are they?
He prefers not to talk about it.
It is dangerous to jump onto a moving train.
Tom apologized.
Fill the bucket with water.
School's out for summer.
Nobody owns the moon.
Do you own a computer?
Hurry up! We'll be late.
You're finicky.
How many students are there in total?
Hang on tight.
Tell me why you didn't do what I asked.
I just can't wait to do that.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
She barely ate her lunch.
You've got to be kidding me!
He'll be seventeen in February.
I know it's hard to walk away.
She doesn't have the ticket.
We heard gunshots.
I shouldn't have to tell you to keep your room clean.
Quite a few people were present at the meeting yesterday.
I think we're done.
I didn't even know that my car had been stolen.
Who wants to go shopping?
Tom can't help himself.
Have you ever had a serious illness?
I persuaded him to go to the party.
I did not expect it to be that big.
Tomorrow is a holiday.
Instead of complaining, maybe you should help.
I fell in love.
In any case, I must finish this work by tomorrow.
Do you know any doctors who speak Japanese?
We're still shopping around.
Please sign here.
I'm not very athletic.
Today you can eat as much as you want.
He lost his son in the traffic accident.
He wrote a letter yesterday.
When will you harvest your wheat?
I'm afraid I've run short of coffee.
Are you sure you didn't hear anything?
Are you doing all right?
The tornado touched down two kilometers from my school.
I think it's time for me to abandon that plan.
Did you find your purse?
Do you mind if I stay here?
Tom always stays at school as late as the teachers allow him to.
No one could buy anything.
It seems we are in the same boat.
I'm a terrible dancer.
Tom likes Mary just the way she is.
Why don't you pull over?
I feel lonely.
We went to the park to play.
Her speech moved the audience.
The cat is wet.
I feel sorry for you.
Did you work yesterday?
Could you cook this meat a little more?
Today is hectic.
Can I borrow it for about two weeks?
It's a rental.
Have you sold it yet?
We're not so sure.
Tom took another sip.
Keep that thing away from me.
Don't go without a hat.
Wait here.
I never answer email messages from people I don't know.
Go back to your seat.
Have you confirmed it?
Your thirty minutes are up.
The very idea of being sent abroad delighted them.
He began to cry loudly.
I was watching television when the telephone rang.
The saying is quite familiar to us.
All roads lead to Rome.
I stayed home to rest.
I guess I fell asleep.
Exercise outdoors.
I have only five thousand yen.
Have you ever known me to be mistaken?
Don't talk to your mother like that.
I can't do that now.
You won't have a chance.
I'm not finished with you.
She put the key in her bag.
This really is great weather.
Small family farms were disappearing.
Where is the nearest shop?
He's very honest, so we can depend on him.
Who's the composer of this symphony?
We can't choose who our parents are.
Have you seen all these movies?
We desperately need more money to help fund our project.
I'm feeling hungry.
We're proud of that.
Let go of my arm!
She will pay 50 dollars at most.
Does this book belong to you?
I've upset you.
Be careful not to drive on the wrong side of the road.
I wanted to tell you that.
She works for French intelligence.
I think you're probably right.
He exhausted all his energy.
We're pretty confident.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
Ask him when the next plane will be.
I miss you. I need to see you. Could I come over?
Stop being stupid.
The sky is full of dark clouds.
Against all expectations, we became good friends.
I was surprised by what I learned.
I guess not.
I don't believe you anymore.
Tom can't hurt me.
That sounds like a good idea.
I didn't know that you could drive.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
This dog is yours.
What would you do if you were in my place?
Tom is likeable.
Everyone laughed.
He is popular among us.
What's the score?
Tom doesn't want Mary to go anywhere without him.
This ticket entitles you to a free meal.
There were no survivors.
Caesar leaves Gaul, crosses the Rubicon, and enters Italy.
No one uses that kind of weapon anymore.
I thought you were in charge.
It's getting darker and darker.
What are you good at?
It was like a dream.
You taught us that.
Did you feel the earthquake this morning?
I would do it again.
I think you ought to get a little sleep.
I went for help.
Studies say that true happiness comes from giving back, not from material things.
It may have been Tom who broke this window.
She married a rich man.
When I was your age, I had a boyfriend.
I made her a dress.
How large is the population of New York City?
I thought I would find you there.
Everything you've heard is true.
He was looking for a good job.
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
I need to get something.
He will be back shortly.
Don't worry. I'll teach you how to drive.
They told me about it.
How was your stay?
He was taken care of by a certain young doctor.
They were afraid of being overheard.
I forgot to give him the message.
The dog was hit by a truck.
It blew my mind.
It's been snowing all night.
I thought it'd get easier.
What foods should a diabetic not eat?
I have a feeling you might want to see these.
I'm one of your students.
Can you play any musical instruments?
We were eating eggs.
Stop flirting with me.
I never saw you.
Go two blocks and turn left.
It's time to get serious.
You may as well come with me.
I should've warned you earlier.
Did you have a good weekend?
I'm fond of taking pictures.
You weren't married for long, were you?
This cold weather isn't usual for June.
Jobs are scarce.
Tom doesn't have to worry about me.
Do you think this book is worth reading?
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
She tried to persuade him to go with her.
Life in a small town is boring.
They're mine.
It isn't just for show.
Is there something wrong with your phone?
We have to talk right now.
Pardon me?
Can I speak to you?
There was nobody there.
Can you handle it?
Fortunately he didn't die in the accident.
Try not to worry.
My grandfather gets up early.
You're too skinny.
Tom shut his eyes.
She makes it a point to always arrive fashionably late.
I have plenty of friends.
This desk is better than that one.
I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.
Little lights were blinking on and off in the distance.
Has Tom always been fat?
You have too many irons in the fire.
Did Tom call?
I'll bring sandwiches.
Can my friend sleep over tonight?
I want to scratch my nose.
We've gone too far.
The announcer spoke English.
He went to stay with his cousin.
Iron is a useful metal.
I can't complain.
I'm glad you realize that.
I knew it would happen.
I have a lot of dreams.
I think we should all go outside.
That's not what I heard.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
He isn't at home.
My dream is to lead a quiet life in the country.
You need a lot of water.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
You must not get off the train before it stops.
We're very close.
I'm shorter than you.
They couldn't find out why your car won't start.
On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers.
I had chicken pox as a kid.
We're going south.
I just had a sandwich so I'm not hungry.
Is that all of them?
Tom wanted to pull the trigger, but couldn't.
French developed from Latin.
He was naive.
We need to protect ourselves.
She wants to keep him at a distance.
I'm frantic.
He drives me crazy.
You won't be interested.
My jeans won't fit.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
They can add something if they wish.
I don't need your charity.
I don't want to risk losing it.
You have to protect your family.
Would you like to travel abroad?
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
You ran a red light.
I want you to have a job that you love.
Have I made myself clear?
There is no wind today.
There's a chance that tap water may contain harmful substances like chlorine and lead.
I didn't graduate.
He thinks of everything in terms of profit.
Have you ever been mugged?
I just can't figure it out.
All happy families resemble each other, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
She is five years younger than me.
I'd really like to know why he did that sort of thing.
Tell me you're kidding.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
I bought two pairs of pants.
You don't want to see this, do you?
What made her so sad?
How do you know for sure?
Tom was strangled.
Hurry up, and you'll catch the bus.
We think we are over the worst.
Let a porter carry your baggage.
She felt happy to see him.
I really think you should come.
I walked as far as the station.
This book is missing two pages.
We can't turn back now.
She visited her husband in prison.
You have made many mistakes.
I had to do this today.
They're probably Americans.
I just told him.
I don't have to be here.
The girls giggled.
She lives in London.
At what time did he leave?
My mom is overprotective.
I'm unambitious.
Do you know how to play chess?
This morning I got up earlier than usual.
Is Tom's name on the list?
I know you did it.
I'm an adult.
How can I make him stop?
Leave the room as it is.
I started it.
I didn't want that to happen.
She had no sooner seen me than she ran away.
Can you drive a stick shift?
He chose the wrong man to pick a fight with.
They went on an expedition to the Antarctic.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
Have you ever been run over?
Are you sure we've never met before?
Tom said Mary told him that.
You never asked why.
She asked me to pass her the salt.
For the past 10 years, I've fed my dog dry dog food.
They're looking for you.
She ironed his shirts.
I like that it is soft.
She grew up in Australia.
Tom made the same mistake again.
I've got something better.
I think a part-time job is a good experience.
He'll run out of luck sooner or later.
I don't care how much it costs. I'm going to buy it anyway.
I don't know what to expect.
I'm going to ask you to do your duty.
Whose bike is this?
They're broke.
I just wanted to make a gesture.
I know they'll all want to help you.
How long will you stay in Kyoto?
They are the same age.
Do you really think Tom will help us?
Don't go against his wishes.
Is anybody in there?
All I have is books.
There was a cold wind blowing from the north.
I had a dentist's appointment this morning.
May I use the vacuum cleaner?
Look up these words in the dictionary.
I hope you had a nice trip.
The snowstorm raged for a full week.
It's a strange one.
I asked Tom to wait a minute.
What makes you think that Tom prefers living in the country?
I enjoyed it very much.
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
The cows are eating grass.
I think so, too.
I don't want to take a walk now.
You gotta get more organized.
It is easier than I thought.
Tom believes whatever Mary says.
Afghanistan is at war.
We're prepared.
The path zigzagged up the steep slope.
I don't care who you're going with.
Be careful crossing the street.
I have difficulty paying my rent.
In a sense, you are right.
I asked him many questions about ecology.
He'll be back by five o'clock.
How will we pay our debts now?
You understand what I mean, don't you?
What do you think of this red hat?
I didn't get the joke.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
The cat ran up the tree.
Christmas is only a few days away.
Don't wait for me for dinner.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
He was ready to face his fate.
What had happened wasn't Tom's fault.
You made a wise choice.
Microsoft has a completely new operating system in the works.
He seems happy.
I've fallen in love with you.
You're not a teenager yet.
I never thought I'd see her there.
Where did you find my umbrella?
I don't suppose anything will happen.
Everything is negotiable.
I'm going to do an internship at a local company.
Just give me some time. I'm sure I can figure out how to solve the problem.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
They are jealous of us.
Who painted this?
Contact her if you have any questions.
He saluted the lady.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Here are the rules.
There's something else I need to discuss with you.
We have five days to go before the summer vacation.
This science-fiction novel is very interesting.
We had a wonderful time.
I must go alone.
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Wait'll you hear what happened today.
I am glad to help you.
He is used to making speeches.
Do not disobey the rules.
Please tell Tom I'm sorry.
She isn't running.
I lost my shoe in the fire.
I think you're nuts.
The sun rises in the morning.
You've had all week to study.
She's not a child.
I realized that even though I wanted to eat, I didn't have enough time.
Now I am too old to walk.
It's never too late to say no.
Life could be so easy.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
What's there to be afraid of?
He's a well-known television personality.
Is that all you can say?
You're exhausted.
We can proceed.
He has a large family.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
There are a lot of children in the park.
The series of crimes were thought to have been committed by the same man.
She approved of the wedding.
Refer to the instruction manual if you need to fix the refrigerator.
She'd just begun to read the book when someone knocked on the door.
Here's a list of people I want to invite to our wedding.
How much will all this cost?
I'll tell him so when he comes here.
Is it clean?
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore.
Tom probably didn't do the work himself.
I love my work.
Boxers need quick reflexes.
He laughed at me.
Add a little more milk to my tea, please.
It was silly of him to refuse her offer.
Mary hugged her doll.
I was barely able to work.
I am on duty now.
That is my overcoat.
Tom tried to persuade Mary to stay at home.
I think I'll come back later.
Tom died about a year ago.
All her carefully made plans began to unravel one by one.
Water is heavier than oil.
I've been waiting for him for an hour.
Did you listen to music last night?
I've been worried all along.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I just don't want you to have it.
Air is lighter than water.
It is difficult to talk to him.
Tom dyed his hair blue.
She congratulated me on my success.
That's so hard.
He went to Austria for the purpose of studying music.
I've got a friend in the FBI.
Tom has never seen Mary dance.
Tom is there already.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
The country is headed on the wrong track.
I left you a message.
That dress is perfect for you.
Are you dressed?
I really don't want to go to Boston with Tom.
Where are your parents?
I'm beautiful.
I don't have the results.
Would you like to come in?
We waited outside.
I think he will object to our plan.
Do I have to go right now?
Don't take any chances.
I think she'll succeed.
Here's my telephone number.
Philosophy is not a thing one can learn in six months.
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
We hang out together all the time.
It is strange that he has not come yet.
I'll go see if Tom is here.
My sister is very intelligent.
Look, here comes your train.
She waved her hand to us.
He told me where to go.
They fight like cat and dog.
Don't read in this room.
Everybody blames you.
What's that disgusting smell?
We can't afford it.
My father is too old to work.
I'll be counting on you to bring the drinks.
We're in college.
The changes resulting from the women's movement have affected both women and men.
She sent him a message.
It'll rain for sure.
Don't leave!
I saw your brother the other day.
He's not at home.
I don't really have a boyfriend.
No one responded.
You are always watching TV.
Tom was third.
I've got better things to do with my time.
Mary looks cute no matter what she wears.
Are you close to your family?
It's not raining yet.
Neither is beautiful.
The place was almost empty.
You can trust them.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
The train stopped.
I can't hear what they're saying.
He repairs his own car.
I couldn't finish it.
Mt. Fuji is noted for its beautiful shape.
I want to live close to the station.
Noh is a traditional Japanese art.
I want one, too.
His car was stuck in knee-deep snow.
We have to change our plan.
I am sick.
She often eats breakfast there.
The first casualty of every war is the truth.
Are you watching carefully?
Do I need this?
In the digital age, handwriting is slowly becoming a lost art.
You're grumpy.
I hope you're well rested.
I wanted to know what happened.
How will you manage?
Tom is obese, isn't he?
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
We elected him mayor.
It is not necessarily so.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
Everything is going very well.
Do you think so?
Look at the picture.
They had had to use what money they had.
The first lesson is easy.
It was a dark and stormy night.
I like to travel alone.
Would it be OK if I turned off the lights?
It's clear from his actions that he loves her.
Tom and Mary used to be good friends.
Which credit cards can I use?
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
If you testify against him, we can put him behind bars for good.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
I advise customers.
I'll work as long as I live.
There are a lot of fish in that lake.
Why don't you let us go?
I can't control what happens.
He has been studying French for eight years.
You're doing it right.
Your zipper is open.
He earns a living.
I want to talk to you about this report.
The dog is white.
What are you doing at school this afternoon?
She smiled at him.
Don't tell the others, OK?
I think I understand.
You can't go yet.
She continued sobbing without looking up.
Kissing a person who smokes is like licking an ashtray.
The movie was really good.
I'm looking for your sister. Where is she?
I don't like your suggestion.
It's cold today so button your coat.
Why is everyone crying?
She calls him every night.
You must pay in advance.
It's necessary for you to go.
I want you to go see the nurse.
News of the recent blast is all over the radio.
I had no idea that you were having problems with Tom.
Tom showed her the letter from Santa Claus.
He was absent from the meeting.
I feel bad for her.
I don't want you eating between meals.
The answer's no.
I was in the hospital a few days ago.
Just give me what I want.
Renting a car was the best option.
I teach French.
She advised him not to believe everything the teacher says.
I think Tom works in this office.
Good movies broaden your horizons.
I'm not finished yet.
Never tell anyone.
I don't have time to read.
Our house faces the beach.
To drive a car, you need a license.
Let's share this money.
Please try again.
Don't be fooled by her appearance.
I respect your opinion.
I'm truly sorry.
He is no longer a child.
He replied that he did not know.
Show me where it happened.
Yesterday, I bought a book.
That gave Tom an idea.
Tom has a voracious appetite.
It's healthy to breathe deeply.
Where is the bus stop?
I hate hypocrites.
You're a very sensitive guy, aren't you?
I don't like either tea or coffee.
There's a hole in this sock.
We are brother and sister.
Suddenly, it started to rain very hard.
Stay where you are.
We took an examination in math last week.
How did you get to know her?
I was unable to go outside.
You must not go out today.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
She got the money from him even though he said that he wouldn't give it to her.
You were in a coma.
I gather you were hurt.
Everything must be handled very carefully.
I think that China will play an active role.
I am hungry because I did not eat breakfast.
I ordered you a drink.
I'm going back to college.
Thank you for your kind words.
That girl over there is my sister.
Where is the coffee shop?
Don't you think I know my own brother?
His words surprised me.
Do what I say.
I appreciate your restraint.
That's why I trust you.
I fully understand your concerns.
Did anybody see you?
I bought a book yesterday.
I'm ashamed.
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
He didn't take an umbrella with him.
As soon as he was left alone, he opened the letter.
How many goats do they have?
It's me that went there yesterday.
Do you have less expensive ones?
Are you all finished here?
You don't have to sing.
Let's wrap up this work now and go out drinking.
Switzerland is situated between France, Italy, Austria and Germany.
Did you choose an interesting book for your son?
When was the last time you saw him?
How's everybody doing?
Do you really believe I killed my brother?
Fish can be dry and tasteless if it's overcooked.
That's all you get.
It's for your own safety.
I'll just get you started.
I am familiar with his music.
I think we still have plenty of time.
She asked him questions.
Probably it will snow tomorrow.
He's good at cards.
There must be an easier way to do this.
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.
Tom said Boston is a nice place to visit.
He came back last August.
He has never cleaned his room.
Show it to me.
Tom knows what you did.
I was arrested on the spot.
I know I got it right this time.
We have plenty of time now.
You should try to write more legibly.
Be yourself.
She thought that I was a doctor.
I like trains better than buses.
Do you have a larger size?
Is your sister older than you?
Losing your health is worse than losing your money.
Have you finished?
The fire went out by itself.
Grow up a little.
Blow your nose.
He belongs to the upper class.
He must be homesick.
I thought maybe I'd better not clean my room.
Please don't speak so fast.
The news made her sad.
It's a complicated question.
We're too close.
Could you turn the volume down?
Just give me your name and address.
I'm not good at multitasking.
We have a lot to learn from each other.
She reserved a room.
I caught him stealing the money.
I fixed it.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
I don't know anybody else here.
I fear for the future of mankind.
It's quite safe.
A river flows through the valley.
Just close your eyes.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Are you out of your mind?
There's not a chance.
I want him to solve the problem.
He is Japanese by birth.
I want to see what happens.
I thought you were asleep.
Where will we eat breakfast today?
It's a big one.
Did you try restarting the computer?
Don't try God's patience.
I can't find the right words.
There's no need to apologize.
What time do you leave for school?
He insists on things being done in the most efficient way and he usually does them that way himself.
She is in low spirits today.
All you have to do is fill in this form.
That sounds like a train.
Many American planes were shot down.
Tom eats lunch at the school cafeteria two or three times a week.
I had a premonition.
Do you need anything?
I got dealt a bad hand.
This is more expensive than that.
Where's convenient for you?
From the hill, we could see all the buildings in the city.
You should exercise more.
I met him in January.
It was all done.
Where is the south terminal?
Her hobby was collecting old coins.
Our dog is in the kennel.
Do what he says.
Last Sunday, Mary and I went to the library together.
I think you need someone to talk to.
Can you answer this?
Tom jumped off the diving board.
I told you I hate that shirt.
Did I wake you guys?
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
Tom split up with Mary.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
This book will give you a clear idea of the American way of life.
I'm not young anymore.
Pay attention on the road.
Tom declined my invitation.
I'm feeling kind of sleepy.
Thank you very much for all you have done.
My feelings for you haven't changed.
I wonder what the average weight of a strawberry is.
This is a painting.
I miss you when you're not here.
I have your schedule here.
I kind of like you.
It would be nice if you had a wedge of lime I could squeeze into my icewater.
You wanted this, didn't you?
I got up very late this morning.
Would you like to freshen up?
The horse chafed at the bit put in its mouth.
This is just what I wanted.
I was going to write to you, but I forgot.
I will try.
That isn't much, is it?
I like dogs very much.
I saw Tom at the funeral today.
I've got eyes.
I just want to help.
Is there somewhere in Europe you'd like to visit?
I've been here for an hour.
Your French is perfect.
He is accustomed to hard work.
Everyone quieted down.
They gave up.
I want to make my parents proud.
It's a small world.
Someone entered the room.
I just want to make sure that his offer has no strings attached.
Give me a piece of paper.
When did I ever hurt you?
There's someone I want you to meet.
I want to date other women.
It was sunny this morning.
Have you been to Cairo?
I know them.
A dove is a symbol of peace.
Air, like food, is a basic human need.
What's it made from?
Everyone knew what went wrong.
I will come if I have time.
Can I say it aloud?
The money you give them will be put to good use.
You're invited.
Please don't die.
Tell me what really happened.
We volunteered.
She said that she had to be back before dawn.
This car was cheap enough for him to buy.
Who cares about me?
I'm not very confident.
By chance, I found a hot spring.
I have billions of dollars.
Don't you care?
I don't know anything about marketing.
I now know more about Tom than I really want to know.
The rich are different from you and me.
Someone knocked on the door.
Are you prepared for the worst?
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
She is always complaining of her small salary.
Hold your applause, please.
You only have to ask for it.
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
In some places, people died of hunger.
You're not that interesting.
I don't know if I can trust you.
You're very attractive.
Why are they fighting?
Did you sleep all day?
He will join us later.
She's a dumb blonde.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
You don't seem convinced.
He worked from nine to five.
You must be a good cook.
I envy your good health.
His wife leads him by the nose.
It is regrettable that you did not start earlier.
I repeated what he said exactly as he had said it.
Do you have a phone?
It's not a suitable topic for discussion.
I'm in bed.
I am glad to help you.
I know things.
This is infuriating.
It's for free.
It doesn't take long to get to his house.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
I let you catch me.
What are you doing here this time of night?
I am ashamed of your conduct.
I had expected him at the meeting.
I really appreciate your coming.
There are no easy answers.
I would never question his honesty.
You're very understanding.
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
Children like watching television.
I don't know what to do now.
I don't know when, but it'll happen someday.
Are you expecting anyone?
I couldn't live like that.
When are you going back to your own country?
I don't have a fever.
You're spoiling the mood.
I'm not stopping you.
I made a deal.
Be confident.
What can you give me?
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
I've got to see you.
Look up there.
Tom will need to go further.
She demanded to see the manager.
I had an out-of-body experience.
I didn't answer any of Tom's questions.
Did they say what happened?
I've loved you since the day I first saw you.
Where is the cat?
You're not good at this.
Finally, we arrived in England.
My father hasn't gone abroad even once.
I'm glad you brought that up.
How much is it including insurance and tax?
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
A little walk will give you a good appetite for breakfast.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
My heart wasn't in the work.
Do you know where we live?
I got what you needed.
Someone attacked Tom.
He's very talented.
Are you enjoying this?
Tom made some scrambled eggs.
Why are you so insecure?
I am a good boy.
Please don't forget to put stamps on the letters that I gave you to mail.
They married when they were young.
I'm being promoted.
His behavior really got on my nerves.
My nose itches.
I can't promise you anything.
The speaker should stand where everyone can see him.
I hate to see you so miserable.
She got married to him.
I want to know what's funny.
Tom rents rooms to students.
I appreciate this so much.
We buy stationery in bulk.
It is not good to laugh at others.
This tree is three meters around.
I must hurry.
However hard you try, you can't finish it in a day.
Am I clear?
What do you spend most of your time doing?
Please make the bed.
Do you have a receipt?
Turn left at the second traffic light.
It tastes just right.
Get my rifle.
I don't feel like talking anymore.
I am very busy these days.
Have you confirmed it?
I like them all.
This mountain has an altitude of 3,000 meters.
I haven't the foggiest idea.
We're stubborn.
I'll call.
I really do have to go.
Where on earth did you meet him?
I want to be safe.
We have to take this problem into consideration.
I want my money.
The flowers are beginning to grow and everything is becoming green.
Do you like to dance?
Somebody told me that today's test was identical to the one we had last year.
I am the same age.
You should always tell the truth.
Save your strength.
Obviously, you volunteered.
Tom led the attack.
He's love struck.
One-third of the Earth's surface is desert.
I don't go in for that sort of thing.
I'm too tired to argue.
You have to be strong.
He threw a rock into the pond.
You could count to ten when you were two years old.
The road turns left there.
How many people are in your crew?
This monument is dedicated to the soldiers who gave their lives to their country.
I can't do without this dictionary.
If we begin early, we can finish by lunch.
He got all his information from secondary sources.
I know where we can get one.
Go and open the door.
It is up to me to tell the sad news to her.
I will explain it to her.
I want to thank you.
No one ran ahead of him.
Which eye is hurting you?
The weather turned better.
Aren't you going to say something?
She wept with emotion.
We enjoyed skating.
Do you want your old job back?
He would like to take part in the contest.
There's not much to say.
Tom already knows you want to quit your job.
I like classical music.
The problem is not settled yet.
Tom is older than Mary.
Are there any cute girls in your class?
You can dance, can't you?
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
It seemed like you weren't interested.
It's exciting.
Shoes are stiff when they are new.
It was stupid of him to turn down his offer.
I like summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Would you like to switch seats?
Don't let your mother know that.
That was weird.
I dislike being alone.
Who gave the command?
I'd like to play tennis with you some day.
I'm still studying French.
I tried thinking about why it was that I didn't trust him.
Do you spend much time writing email?
I'm feeling sort of tired.
I'm not an only child.
He accidentally hit his thumb with the hammer.
I will help you if possible.
Why didn't you do it?
Tom said he would be here.
Don't tell me how to spend my money.
What year of medical school are you in?
She always prides herself on her academic background.
He forgot his name.
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.
It's not fake.
I'll always be here.
Fasten your seatbelts.
Do you think I'm right?
Meat won't keep long in this heat.
I'm a good person.
Don't you want to say anything?
What are the doctor's office hours?
They announced that they were getting a divorce.
It's about time the government did something about pollution.
The bike's mine.
Well? Will you come?
Tom was the life of the party.
She came close to drowning.
The game became exciting.
All I want to do is finish what I started.
Would you please reserve a room near the Toronto international Airport?
The cliff hangs over the sea.
How are complaints handled?
I couldn't find it.
She held him by the sleeve.
You can tell me anything.
Sales fell off in the third quarter.
I'm very sad to hear that.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
Don't give up.
I haven't eaten.
What he said was not true.
Tom will thank me for this one of these days.
Cats can see even in dark places.
I will always be there for you.
The library will issue you a library card.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
Don't fret.
I'll step outside.
I want you to look out the window.
How do you put up with all the noise?
I have something to give you.
Excuse me. Can you speak English?
This house is mine.
The door remained closed.
I want to keep a cat instead of a dog.
He got more than he bargained for.
That's not the problem.
When will that picture I wanted enlarged be ready?
Why don't you read it for yourself?
He was painfully thin.
Generally speaking, women live longer than men.
It's not like you're going to get arrested or anything.
I was speaking with Tom.
Did you enjoy reading that book?
I tried to talk to Tom, but he ignored me.
The early bird gets the worm.
Tell us the story from beginning to end.
You don't know how bad I want to leave.
That's a very old saying.
We can solve this problem easily.
I don't want to forget it.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Get in the back seat.
What about his girlfriend?
What're you all dressed up for?
I don't feel like going to the movies tonight.
It was very funny.
How much does my debt amount to?
I should never have stolen that.
Why is he staring at me?
What did you eat?
Brush your teeth after meals.
They are Russian.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
What year were you born?
Were you busy?
I had lunch with Tom at a restaurant near the office.
Tom tried to open the door.
He pretended not to be hurt.
It was hard to believe.
That's not really important right now.
How do you feel today?
I locked the front door.
His ancestors went there from Ireland.
He acted as our guide.
You have no idea how distressed she was.
Do you eat it in the classroom?
I don't know how to do it.
I don't even know who has stolen what.
Tell Tom to wait.
He handed over all his property to his son.
No one lives in that building anymore.
When was your last day off?
That's not good.
I'm by your side.
I like to be thorough.
Is it good news?
I want to hear your opinion.
Don't worry about it.
He muttered something under his breath.
We are leaving Japan next month.
Your name's further down the list.
I can't stand it anymore.
How did we do that?
I overheard your conversation.
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
I'm all by myself.
I am doing my best.
What do you think of this plan?
I'm a little disappointed.
I raised my hand to ask a question.
Her mother started screaming.
Stop being so nice to me.
We won't change anything.
I'll never leave you.
I can't swim well.
I'm not that desperate yet.
A lot of my classmates think that I'm dumb.
You can't say anything till you know the circumstances.
How long will it be to dinner?
We accepted his offer.
Tom has already spoken to me about it.
Tom peeked inside.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Many health specialists say that you should eat three meals a day.
She went out.
We are looking forward to your visit to our new office.
The tank is empty.
She laid her baby on the bed.
How exactly would that work?
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
He said better times were ahead for the country.
All of a sudden, all the lights went out.
You are too sensitive to criticism.
I decided to tell her that I love him.
This book is a whodunit.
That's why he got up early.
I want all my children to go to college.
She gave us a vague answer.
Are you still married?
It took exactly an hour.
A fire broke out after the earthquake.
He is a rude person.
They bought a home with a pool.
The boys are excited.
Tom was bitten by a cobra.
He lives in a trailer park.
I have to eat, too.
They don't understand me when I speak German.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
I'll wait here for you.
I use Google almost every day.
I want us to do it together.
Her name wasn't on the list.
I go to school by bus.
Everything is great.
That guy's got a big mouth.
I don't have a guilty conscience.
There's no way to win.
Don't worry. There's nothing wrong with you.
There's no turning back.
Did you drop it?
I like puzzles.
I love this game.
It's a lot of fun skiing in fresh snow.
I had a feeling you would be late.
Go brush your teeth.
They're cool.
Lend him as much money as he needs.
You can't just quit.
Bathe the baby, won't you?
The man robbed him of all his money.
It was the only thing to do.
Tom should have done things differently.
I already told you he isn't here.
That didn't even occur to me.
I stuck with it until I was finished.
This is an international community.
He has my fate in his hands.
I've done no such thing.
Tom pretended to be busy.
If I had wings, I would fly to you.
I'm early.
Do you plan to buy that car?
We went to Australia last summer.
He said it himself.
Is that real blood?
I want to know where you heard that.
I would like to visit South Korea.
Can I have some tea?
Let's jump into the water.
Tom has just finished washing dishes.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
Show me your passport.
I tried hard.
My bag was stolen.
Tom died in Mary's arms.
May I speak to you?
They're mine.
Don't deceive me.
I get up around seven.
We want you to take it.
A rabbit has long ears and a short tail.
Let me explain it with a diagram.
I'm sick of your complaints.
I'll keep that in mind.
I let you down.
Tom helped us push the car.
I really had a good time.
I know that I'm supposed to enjoy this class, but I don't.
Give me a break.
Edison invented many useful things.
I know nothing about music.
You shouldn't go to school.
You can't keep this a secret.
What did Tom say about me?
What time do you leave home in the morning?
Progress is unavoidable.
The mayor presented the prizes in person.
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
Take off your socks, please.
What part is wrong?
I'll examine it for myself.
Have you finished cleaning your room yet?
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
They knew they must fight together to defeat the common enemy.
Keep me informed.
No one can figure it out.
You don't owe anybody anything.
Isn't that enough for you?
All you do is party.
Please don't write to me again.
He is busy with his work.
I didn't feel like cooking.
You need to do more research.
I'm lying.
We treated him in the politest manner possible.
I can't take another step.
I had fun here.
There are cherry trees on both sides of the street.
You saved us all.
The sidewalks were wet after the rain.
Are you coming to the store with me?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
He is going to explain it to me.
Tom eats less than Mary does.
Tom is afraid of making mistakes.
You're going to have to do better to convince me of that.
No one knew it.
Are you religious?
These are our books.
I found no money left in my pocket.
I don't suppose you know anything about this.
The mountains in the Himalayas are higher than those in the Andes.
We can't stay here.
I have a pretty dog.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
He wants you to come home.
When will you go?
The teachers teach all day long.
Three years have gone by since we got married.
I actually haven't been to Boston yet.
I can't catch up with Tom.
Are you sick? You look pale.
I only have one so far.
You didn't need to hurry. You got here too early anyway.
I never had a girlfriend before.
Tell me how I can help you.
He is the head of the sales department.
I wanted you to have a little fun.
I'm not the guy you want making this decision.
The chicken is undercooked.
Where have you been the last few days?
This egg is fresh.
I was hoping to raise my kids in Boston.
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
The cat crouched down ready to jump.
Is this natural?
That exercise is good for the abdominal muscles.
This applies to your case as well.
I prefer French films to American ones.
You were hurt, weren't you?
She loves to wear tight clothes.
We are faced with a difficult choice.
Start writing.
This is a good textbook.
I have enough money to buy it.
Tom sent Mary a gift.
I'm happy to be back.
She is blackmailing him.
It's even worse than I thought.
I simply don't understand.
You're really awesome.
He did not know what to say.
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
I'm sorry that I can't meet you tonight.
Start the car.
I'd like to take this with me.
Let's start with beer.
I asked Tom if he needed more money.
Tom has lived in Chicago for a year.
This happens all the time.
They didn't keep their promise.
Who did you write a letter to?
I hope that it is fine tomorrow.
Tom is a very good guitarist, isn't he?
Tom wants to stay single.
I promise you I won't do it again.
One more thing. If you try anything on Mayu I'll break your spine.
Do you think that'll happen soon?
Wasn't it enough?
Do you still have feelings for him?
Does that satisfy you?
Why are you so happy?
Tom was acquitted for lack of evidence.
A tall building was built next to my house.
Our baby isn't speaking yet.
I appreciate all you've done.
I don't know when I can take a break.
What prevented you from coming earlier?
Who wears the pants in your family?
When are you going to finish this?
He seldom, if ever, reads a book.
I had no time to eat.
I refuse to accept that.
We accepted his invitation.
You don't have to explain.
He has no house in which to live.
I bought it yesterday.
Did you go out?
It was disappointing.
How much did you charge Tom to fix his car?
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
You're going to be OK.
I ordered a book from London.
I love seeing you so happy.
I took that picture a week ago.
I should congratulate you.
It happened to me about a year ago.
Don't be crazy.
You are the one.
He is very sensitive to cold.
I just don't want to discuss it right now.
Can you still remember where we first met?
He can't tell right from wrong.
Have you got any ideas yet?
I can't go with you.
Could you put those bags in the car for me?
It's all been written.
We want to talk to Tom.
Tom was given a warm reception.
Do you know who conquered Mt. Everest first?
I hesitate to ask Tom to help.
It's been my dream since I was a little boy.
Stop following me.
I had my camera stolen.
It's revolting.
I'm nervous and excited.
Why don't you say something?
I've been feeling bad for a week.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
He is a man of his word.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
I'm not rich, nor do I wish to be.
I won't disappoint you.
Look what I did.
They were punished for their crimes.
It was dark in the room.
She risked her life to save him.
It was a warm, friendly meeting.
He's in my class.
You need to press the button.
Don't move or I'll shoot.
That's all I have for you.
I hear what you're saying.
These are not words.
He is the best player on our team.
She's asking for the impossible.
Grab my hand.
He is suffering from a cold.
I'm glad I invited you.
You should look up that word.
Tom would've liked you. It's too bad that you never met each other.
He's not at home.
I just wanted to go jogging.
The girl was busy making tea for her friend.
How can that be?
Are you quite certain about it?
I get only five days off this summer.
Don't call Tom at his home after 2:30.
He's had some very good results lately.
I remember reading about it.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I want you to go somewhere.
It's right up your alley.
My robot's name is Multi.
I guess that's possible.
Please don't go away.
Don't forget to sign your name.
He went to school to study yesterday.
I'm going to need some more time.
She looked away.
You don't look that good.
I'm tough.
Tom and Mary are very hungry.
Everyone will be happy.
I ran into a friend on the bus.
I said I liked it.
She revealed the secret to him.
What a funny man!
I thought they'd heard us.
The bad weather delayed the plane for two hours.
You only have to ask for it.
I found his house easily.
I was reading a book.
Tom is the tallest boy on our football team.
I thought I'd be safe here.
Stop lying.
I want to buy my car back.
I wish to see my father.
Maybe he will arrive tonight.
Tom is Mary's biological father.
She is a most beautiful lady.
Organic food tastes better.
Pull the rope tight.
I'm sure Tom had his reasons.
I am married and I have two sons.
Could you tell me the way to the station?
I like Japanese girls.
You have done a wonderful job.
The mayor's daughter has been kidnapped.
Do you really think Tom is happy?
Feel free to ask any questions.
Something strange is happening.
Your efforts will soon pay off.
I'm prepared.
That boy is very clever.
We must run.
I agree with everything you just said.
I've been thinking about you, too.
It's a fad.
These are questions worth discussing.
She's a very nice girl.
He earns a lot of money.
I am afraid to jump over the ditch.
The price is not reasonable.
Don't be a stranger.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
She bought a dozen eggs.
Why is it that you are always late?
Please refer to the owner's manual for more details.
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you are happy.
Have a good weekend.
I am a Muslim.
He motioned me to stand up.
Do you feel any better?
Go through the market.
Cats were sacred animals in ancient Egypt.
I don't think I can do that.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
I'll never be able to do that without your help.
You've found it.
He was wide awake.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
The trouble is that my son does not want to go to school.
I'd like to say a few words.
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
I took over the business from my father.
I cried a lot.
Her ability to write with her foot is amazing.
She scolded him.
They should thank me.
My mother didn't mention it.
It often snows here.
In my opinion, he's right.
She wants him to be just a friend.
He is no longer living here.
I prefer to go barefoot in the house.
I need Tom's help.
He was my best friend.
Is it broken?
I was barefoot.
He licked his fingers.
I want a boyfriend.
Your cat is fat.
I don't like who you've become.
I was wondering if we could talk.
My wisdom teeth are coming in.
He came back at nine o'clock.
Can I ride this horse for a while?
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
Aren't there any risks?
Don't say I didn't warn you.
He'll succeed for sure.
We're not eating.
You've got everything you need.
It has cooled off.
You had plenty of opportunity.
She made me cookies.
Just put yourself in my shoes.
Tom and I are buddies.
I really doubt that.
It was all covered with dust.
I'm not happy.
How old do you think she is?
That is no business of his.
Have you ever kissed another guy?
All the boys are the same age.
They hid in the cellar.
"Give me something to write with." "Will this do?" "Yes, it will do."
A true friend would not say such a thing.
The office where my father works is near the station.
I asked my teacher what to do next.
Tom paid Mary cash.
I've just finished lunch.
It'll rain for sure.
How many pens does she have?
Anything you say may be used against you.
I steered clear of sensitive topics.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Everyone knows that Bell invented the telephone.
How much does a beer cost?
I wanted to get my mind off work.
She didn't come after all.
They were very confused.
I'm afraid I differ with you on this point.
Call me if you find something.
The computer is to her left.
Please tell me how to get to the airport.
He attributed the accident to the bad weather.
I'm free every day but Monday.
I guess that wouldn't mean much to you.
Can you hold on a little longer?
I hope you don't mind.
I also went there.
It wasn't as expensive as I expected.
He thinks his job is pointless.
Stop arguing.
I'm busy.
He was re-elected mayor.
We talk all the time.
She is a good swimmer.
I have breakfast at seven every morning.
That house is big.
Time flies like an arrow.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
It's very simple.
Were you spying on me?
He has the backing of a certain politician.
I'm not scared of anybody.
You've both been very impressive today. I'm proud of you.
It took more than a month to get over my cold, but I'm OK now.
They are going to give a party the day after tomorrow.
I really like you a lot.
I don't regret what happened last night.
You should keep your promise.
Tom is doing great now.
My friend says that she's suicidal.
His house is there on the right.
I thought I'd prefer going by myself.
She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
I could not have done otherwise.
He's wanted for grand theft auto.
It didn't work out.
You'll understand it later on.
It's dark, so watch your step.
I just followed your instructions.
Thanks for your comments.
This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
That's ludicrous.
They are jealous of us.
The apples are delicious.
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
I'm not going to eat this.
How many books do you think you have read so far?
It snowed yesterday.
The car didn't move.
I'm against the bill.
Do you know who painted this picture?
I recovered.
They stopped talking.
Were you at home yesterday?
Give me a minute.
The price reflects the demand.
My TV has quit working.
We're grateful.
That's not good enough for you.
When was the last time you had a really good cry?
I don't remember anything else right now.
I like it very much.
People around the world are getting fatter.
You should have a doctor examine your condition.
I really wish I could believe you.
Tom let us go.
I didn't want any of that.
We are looking for someone who is proficient in French.
I work in a hospital laboratory.
I have brought his umbrella by mistake.
Did you live here?
You're confused again, aren't you?
This is the place I told you about.
Are you drinking?
I'm afraid you can't do that.
He, and he alone, must go.
What's your favorite board game?
Thank you for helping me celebrate my birthday.
What a strange guy!
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
I think Tom is drunk.
My friends are all married.
I'd like to try doing this without your help.
You're temperamental.
I do anything I feel like.
This room is air-conditioned.
Does he know that you love him?
They fell.
The paper says that a typhoon is on its way.
All the players did their best.
Leaves are falling.
The room is being painted by him.
Can you believe this is already happening?
It's just a fantasy.
You never have any doubts, do you?
Tom often comes to see me on weekends.
Do you mind if I watch TV for a while?
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Try to keep it down.
I'd be careful with that if I were you.
I'm going to fix some dinner.
Compared to Tokyo, London is small.
He treated me badly.
The next meeting will be on the tenth of June.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
It was raining.
She bought him a sweater.
How big is your house?
Next Wednesday will be fine.
They deserve it.
Open the doors.
I like sushi.
He stayed in bed because he wasn't feeling well.
I don't live with Tom.
You have more energy than I do.
I saw what your dog did.
I am really pleased with my new car.
I know your roommate.
It's a brain-teaser.
I waited more than two hours.
Are they cops?
You're probably tired.
Pass me the salt.
Will that be all?
I want something to eat.
The cherry blossoms are at their best.
That can't be good for you.
You'll never leave this town.
Good morning, everybody.
Is this the only picture of her you have?
They refused to join the army.
Put some clothes on.
Never choose a new vocation just because you are restless.
He would sometimes talk with the soldiers.
What's your favorite breakfast food?
Could I use your phone?
Stop crying like a girl.
I have lots of friends.
I stayed at home instead of going out.
They were in a hurry to get home.
My brother loves taking pictures of mountains.
Isn't that right?
Do you still love him?
How could you not give me the message?
"Who is it?" "It's your mother."
At times I feel like quitting my job.
See for yourself.
He would do whatever it takes to make money.
He's got the biggest eyebrows I've ever seen.
You're hiding something.
Tom advertised his saxophone for sale.
Not much has changed.
Tom is getting married next month.
Please turn on the light.
The river which flows through Paris is the Seine.
Those prisoners were set free yesterday.
I hope you will be completely cured.
I can't just stay here.
Do you believe in miracles?
I want my life back.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
What have you been doing all this time!
She carried off all the prizes.
Why don't you repaint your house?
I'll make tea for you.
I'd like to get a refund.
The government appointed a committee to investigate the accident.
I'm the same height as he is.
He wrote a book about his adventures in the jungle.
I thought you were smart.
Choose books carefully.
You were so strong.
She watched him drawing a picture.
Don't tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend.
You understand this, don't you?
Everyone's a winner.
I recommend this.
I can't help the way I feel about you.
What about you?
She asked him if he was a student at this school.
Tom didn't like that place.
I'm counting on your help.
The choice is all up to you.
I have an important meeting.
You aren't looking.
Be punctual.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
Don't forget your sunscreen.
It's not what he said, but the way he said it.
Where can I find an outlet for all my anger?
You won't succeed.
What time is good for you?
We need some volunteers.
You don't have to answer that.
I have seen "Star Wars" twice.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.
He takes everything lightly.
I'll try to distract them.
Her eyes are blue.
I'm kind of happy.
We have enough money.
I'm not telling you again.
Tom gets angry very easily.
Have a taste.
I can't kiss you now.
I hate it.
Tom wanted Mary to apologize to John.
The last bus had already gone when I got to the bus stop.
He is so careless that he often makes mistakes.
She baked me a cake.
Did you inform your teacher of this?
Why don't you talk to him?
You must pay in advance.
My father has just returned from abroad.
Tom has never kissed anyone in public.
I must leave now.
Let me explain the rules.
Please refrain from smoking.
Ask anybody.
I don't know who's involved.
Where are you sleeping tonight?
Tom went into the kitchen to get some coffee.
I want to be invited.
I thought the show was over.
Maybe you should have a little talk with Tom.
I'll set you free.
It's time to get serious.
I'm not that desperate yet.
That happened to me this morning.
During hard times, people might not go on a trip, but they might be willing to pay extra for good coffee.
He speaks Russian.
I'd be willing to do anything to get that job.
I washed my T-shirt.
I felt naked.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
I'll cooperate.
They abandoned the ship.
This building is the architect's crowning achievement.
What a country!
No one will help us.
I'm finicky.
I had a very high fever.
We're finished already.
Tom isn't really as rich as everyone thinks he is.
I believe Tom is right.
Let's not talk about it.
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do.
You're going to turn a lot of heads with that dress.
I'll go crazy if this keeps up.
Are you insinuating something?
Which road should I take?
It depends on the weather.
Tom removed his coat.
Let go of the handle.
It is stupid of you to believe in him.
I think you went too far.
Tom sipped his coffee.
Tom is lucky, isn't he?
You didn't mean it, did you?
Do you play in a band?
The ice is too thin to skate on.
Where's your father now?
You look happy today.
If he comes, give him my regards.
Are you bored?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Do you see a rose?
I disagree with you.
Why didn't you tell me?
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The rumor's all over town.
Can't you ever be punctual? I have been waiting here for one hour.
If I were to tell you all I know, you would be amazed.
The children returned home at dusk.
Fish cannot live out of water.
Tom asked the stranger who he was.
He was slain in battle.
I only need a minute.
My wife's part-time job brings in a little extra money.
I don't like your taste in color.
I could scarcely stand on my feet.
They're all alike.
You must always keep your hands clean.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tom isn't married anymore.
Where did you go?
Nobody but a fool would believe it.
It's not that hard.
It's a good start, don't you think?
Everything's going to be fine.
How are we going to pay for all this?
I can't get the door to shut properly.
Let someone else handle it.
His sudden death was a tragedy.
I hear you were grounded.
You may choose what you like.

There's a black sheep in every flock.
He did his best.
I love to party.
He showed her the way.
She was cleaning the house in preparation for a party.
What do you think is in the box?
My sister came along on the shopping trip.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
That actually seems to be the problem.
I got this as a wedding gift, but I've never used it.
I'll speak to anyone at extension 214.
I'll give you this camera.
I let my friend copy my homework.
We really had nothing to lose.
Why are you so tired?
I've already fed the baby.
The entire city was without electricity.
That's all that matters.
He devoted a lot of time to study.
You've certainly been busy.
Tell me again how much money you have.
You should practice playing the violin every day.
Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
I am surprised to learn this.
It is really cheap.
That's what's most important.
She answered my letter right away.
He speaks quickly.
His sudden death was a tragedy.

Can you lend me a little money?
Why are you still here?

You're not as good as you think you are.
Call a policeman.
I paid him on the spot for his work.
She began to gain weight.
Don't trust anyone.
I know this must come as a shock.
I didn't order dinner.
Kiss me.
Are you still jealous?
Maybe we should talk about this first.
Were you going to the train station when I saw you?
Take the oranges out of the fridge.
The train arrived on time.
He is reading.
I fully intend to do everything I said I would do.
Tom writes something in his diary every evening, no matter how tired he is.
I let you down.
I'll go in.
He has a good ear for music.
Let's split the reward fifty-fifty.
I hope you're well paid.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Tom does not want to be late.
I suggest you go west.
I cannot look at this photo without being reminded of my school days.
I had no idea you were involved.
God has a plan for you.
How can you be so sure?
Men are better at this than women.
She lives in New York.
She's never fallen in love.
Europeans like to drink wine.
There is usually a cool breeze here in the evening.
Will you be in Boston this weekend?
He is a man of his word.
The night is still young.
I want to hear you scream.
I've been trying to get in touch with you for months.
I dunno if it's a bug or what, but this software doesn't work right.
The parrot is dead.
I think it's good for you to read this book.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
My father is very tired.
They sat up all night.
Don't worry about it, OK?
She smokes a lot.
There is no way of reaching the island other than by boat.
We're not old.
This is Mary's dog.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Did you hear that what's-his-face crashed his motorcycle?
You gotta get more organized.
Tom doesn't think before he speaks.
I am no match for him.
He wore a light blue tie.
Do you like salmon?
He breathed deeply.
You're so talented.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
You're making me blush.
I know you're right.
You should take the number 5 bus.
Am I right?
You will miss Japanese food in the United States.
We still need your help.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
The farmer plowed his field all day.
The Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting The Merchant of Venice next week.
My belief is that he will succeed.
I think you need to leave now.
His salary can't keep pace with inflation.
I wish that I could have spent more time with my father before he died.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
She went with him to the zoo.
I don't know what we're going to find, but we should find something.
How do you know that it's his?
Procrastinating is an art.
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
He has a rich imagination.
I will go if you go.
This is the very best method.
Take off your socks.
Do you have plans for tonight?
There's nothing down here.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I need a partner.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
You’ll see that I’m right.
The book is now ready for publication.
There's a hair in my soup.
This chicken is overcooked.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
The mechanic assembled the engine.
Please knock before you come in.
If I were in her place, I wouldn't give up yet.
Is anyone going to eat that?
I'm proud of my brother.
I didn't see you until now.
I can't keep my eyes off of it.
What do you need?
I promise you I'll look after you.
This isn't legal.
I want the facts.
If you pass this test, you could graduate next month.
I bet you're busy.
We can't work under these conditions.
You drive.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
You will succeed some day.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
There's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.
Get your hands off me.
I'd like to remind you that you're under oath.
Stock prices plunged to a record low.
Don't get so carried away.
She whispered something into his ear.
She's very beautiful.
I'm just trying to survive.
Concentrate, Tom.
She appears to have been rich.
You only need to concentrate.
They didn't see anything.
They were surprised by what they saw.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
Stop acting like a baby.
She dyed her hair blonde.
I'm sick and tired of eating zucchinis every day.
He got up earlier than usual.
This spoon is for tea.
Oh, don't be so modest.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
Let's hope they don't even think about it.
I hear his business is on the verge of ruin.
What school did you go to?
As he gets older, he's getting more and more stubborn.
You won't be the only one there.
She saw him driving his new car.
He comes from Geneva.
He bothered her with questions.
You ought not to have disclosed the secret.
Where did Tom go yesterday?
They finished their meal.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
Isn't that a little dishonest?
You don't have to apologize.
He never saw his brother again.
Who's that girl?
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
I'm not English.
I talked my wife out of buying a new carpet.
Can you tell me what this is?
Mother has old-fashioned ideas.
Do you think you've made the wrong choice?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
If you want to sell your old sofa, why not put an advertisement in the local paper?
She must still be in her twenties.
That's one of them.
He gave me all the money he was carrying with him.
I am a cook.
Refugees in Africa are seeking help.
That's a fair assumption.
May I ask you another question?
Stay out of the water.
How are things going?
She went to Paris in order to study art.
A good friend will stand by you through thick and thin.
I ignored him.
I'll be back.
I think I can help Tom.
How did you come by this painting?
He was in good spirits.
How did you lose your arm?
It's getting darker and darker.
This is the most comfortable chair in our house.
How long will the storm last?
Do you think you would ever consider going out with me?
Have they ever come on time?
Watch closely.
I can't decide whether to go or not.
I don't know what this is about.
This is Tom's photo album.
I felt my heart beating violently.
Thermometers often go below zero.
Would you like to eat something?
I'd like some water.
Tom is the richest man I know.
She was fond of talking about herself.
I want to believe that everything's all right.
I will leave it to your judgement.
I think it's awesome.
Now that we're alone, let's have fun.
She's too loud.
There are five pencils here.
A lot of time was wasted.
I sleep in my room.
Do you have to do this very often?
She left her children.
"Why are you going to Japan?" "To attend a conference in Tokyo."
You have a regular pulse.
Nobody saw me.
They formed a swim team.
I want to buy a pair of ski boots.
This is the best restaurant I know.
The lady came from a good family.
The room was in a perfect order.
Watch out for rowdy or drunk customers.
The result was disappointing.
I haven't seen you in ages.
She is pleased with the dress.
What on earth are you talking about?
I want to make you an offer.
He had been there for ten years before he came to Kyoto.
I just want to help you relax.
A hundred years is called a century.
I don't have any friends.
She was too shocked to speak.
I gave them a present for their anniversary.
I'm not sure I agree.
He learned the poem by heart.
That's why I wanted you to know.
I'm afraid he cannot come.
He is as tall as her.
While I was waiting for the bus, I witnessed a traffic accident.
Go and get me some milk.
There is no connection between them.
They're all mine.
Have you ever played baseball?
We're powerful.
This show is too racy for teenagers.
Can you account for all the money you spent?
The baby doesn't walk yet.
You should know better than to talk back to your boss.
He wants to go to the United States.
Why don't you pull over?
Please don't overdo it.
You were hurt, weren't you?
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind.
Your watch is ten minutes slow.
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
Whatever you do, don't pull this rope.
I mistook her for her sister. They look so much alike.
I quit smoking.
Let's hope Tom can do that.
It was raining last night.
I hate my mother-in-law.
Can I join you?
I was the one who had to make it happen.
This is not funny.
I thought you used to live in a trailer.
Lake Towada is famous for its beauty.
Does that make sense to you?
Let's do our job.
How cool is this?
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
Things are not what they seem.
I lit the candle.
I don't know how to operate a spinning wheel.
Tom doesn't want to do anything to hurt Mary.
I want you to get started right away.
Everything is fine.
Tom is a dancing teacher.
He had been ill for a week when they sent for a doctor.
You guessed right.
I hope you will soon get well.
The snow prevented the airplane from taking off.
He wished he had more time.
What's their purpose?
Why not just quit?
That car has a roof rack.
The little boy said hello to me.
You ate my sandwich.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
How do you account for that?
Would you wait a second?
I'm not obese.
He asked an awkward question.
I'm not crying.
He is apparently responsible for it.
I hope Tom wins.
The lock on my drawer had been tampered with and some of my papers were missing.
Sorry, I didn't notice that.
He asked me to speak more slowly.
What about a glass of beer?
I saw the file.
Do you have your driver's license?
Tom never would've done this.
We can't all be perfect.
Haste makes waste.
Comedy is something that makes you laugh.
He arrived at the station at seven.
I'm thinking of visiting you one of these days.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
What is it about?
Tom's book about his life with Mary sold like hot cakes.
Are you getting tired?
I've always liked that name.
She's a supermodel.
I'd like to talk with you.
Every girl knows that singer.
Their losses reached one million yen.
He was elected mayor.
We have good news.
Haven't we met before?
It's more trouble than it's worth.
Why didn't you believe me?
Have you ever been arrested?
OK. Go ahead.
Tom scrubbed the bathtub.
I spoke with her for one hour.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
Tom has been very respectful.
I want very much for you to understand.
Where is the problem?
Oh, really?
Check these out.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Scientists can easily compute the distance between planets.
I became aware of someone looking at me.
Tom is extremely patient.
A deal is a deal.
They're back where they want to be.
They questioned him.
Can you leave me alone?
He applied for admission to the riding club.
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
The manager called an urgent staff meeting.
We're going to fight.
Pay attention to what others around you are doing.
I can speak a little English.
This is a matter of the utmost gravity.
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.
This is my final offer.
Do I have to leave a deposit?
I don't like any of them.
It must be really creepy to work in a morgue.
Since it was already late, I went to sleep.
I must be getting close.
Is this the reason you didn't want me to come?
It is evident that he did it.
I do not need money now.
She turned her eyes away.
I understand that a mistake has been made.
They had to read the book many times.
She expressed her thanks for the present.
All the eggs went bad.
She lit the candles.
Wait a second.
He heard the noise.
I felt wonderful.
Are you still interested?
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
She seems to have been ill.
You're doing an excellent job.
You must not shout at him.
She advised him to talk about his life in America.
There you are.
Why don't you let us go?
She was injured in a fall.
How's the project going?
I pretended that I didn't see it.
You have been warned.
I don't know what's best for me.
I'm glad you're coming.
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.
Tom said that the soup was too hot.
We'll do it together.
I feel fine now.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
The car has been acting strangely.
You need to help me.
I am married and I have two sons.
I'm not crazy. You're the one who's crazy.
I was at home all day yesterday.
We were delayed by the heavy traffic.
I felt depressed.
She makes her mother happy.
I can't afford to buy a car.
I don't go to church.
He is crazy about skiing.
Am I interrupting something?
Did anyone laugh?
Tom was surprised by what he saw.
You aren't Tom.
Thank you for the beautiful flowers.
Is your house big?
They can't hear me either.
I can survive alone.
Do you have any food allergies?
I thought you needed money.
I thought that my father was going to kill me.
I arrived too late to hear his speech.
I have proof.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
What happened to your other car?
I wonder what I'll find in the box.
They live on the 12th floor of this condo.
Don't do that. It's not your job.
He was a brave soldier.
Is there a curfew?
The two had been enemies for a long time.
I saw Tom kill the neighbor's cat.
I thought it sounded like a good idea.
He is a good singer.
After we walked for a while, we got to the lake.
Every even number is the sum of two primes.
My watch is five minutes slow.
I want to start over.
I have an eating disorder.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
You're the nicest girlfriend I ever had.
She always says no.
I'm fond of listening to classical music.
Her hair grew back.
I prefer spring to autumn.
"Do you have anything to do?" "Nothing in particular."
We reached the station on time.
I'll tell you my story.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
Goodbye. I'll see you at the time we agreed on.
That is really good news.
Let's go away.
While in Europe, she visited Rome.
Why did you open the box?
One-fifth of my wages go to taxes.
He asked me questions similar to those asked by many others.
Aren't you the one who's always saying we should spend more time together?
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
I thought you'd want this one.
I'm going.
The jail is overcrowded.
He was not sure what to do.
What are your orders?
I haven't told anyone.
I only hope we're not too late.
Were the windows closed?
I'm proud of my dad.
That's how he likes it.
Hurry up, guys.
Weather permitting, let's go on a picnic.
Don't move unless I tell you.
Where's Tom's card?
Believe what you want.
I'm going to sleep.
Can we stop?
Is your father a teacher?
You would have to practice the violin every day.
Anyhow let's begin.
I'm really going to miss Tom.
I'm between jobs.
Keep it together, Tom.
He is not my son, but my nephew.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Had it not been for his aid, I could not have finished the work.
Change is possible.
How long does it last?
I am surprised by a lot of the things he does.
Mary is Tom's daughter-in-law.
She was in a hurry to go home.
They're mine.
He retired at the age of 65.
You want something from me, don't you?
Don't wait up for me.
Are we ready to go?
We need to study more.
Nobody cares for me.
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
I don't like to talk about Tom.
We've all been here before.
I like talking.
They just want someone to blame.
She picked flowers.
I'm lucky today.
She is a good swimmer.
It doesn't matter which side you're on.
Take mine.
Is this all you have, sir?
I'll treat you like an adult when you start acting like one.
I trust him completely.
Please be careful.
He repeated the same mistake.
It was not clear what she said.
Everybody was jealous of my success.
Don't be naive.
I haven't read any of his books.
I appreciate your cooperation.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
Anything you could do in support of their effort would be very much appreciated.
How many times a month do you write a letter to your mother?
I have to talk to you alone.
I always wanted a tree house.
We will make an exception of your case.
Have a good look at this picture.
This is a picture.
Who would you like to speak to?
Many countries have signed a treaty to eliminate nuclear weapons.
He has enough ability to manage a business.
They're not a threat.
Did I mention that before?
We can't reveal classified information.
We have to stop him from drinking any more.
I haven't thought much about it.
Few people are on a first name basis with the president.
I suggest that you go and see a doctor about this as soon as you can.
I see your house.
It's a cultural thing.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
He stuck the book in his bag.
I'm ordering you to leave immediately.
Where's everybody else?
Don't come near me.
I saw him cross the road.
Should I ask her out?
I knocked, but no one opened the door.
Organic food is healthier.
Don't use your real name.
We all want you back.
I wish to live in a big city.
Have you ever lived in Boston?
You will soon get to like him.
I think it's unlikely that plants feel pain.
I agree with you on this point.
He has a hairy chest.
When can I move in?
Can I call you again?
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?
Is there any life on Mars?
I continued singing.
I cannot help laughing at her jokes.
I think we can do it.
Why are we wasting time with this?
He has been gaining weight.
I took a painkiller for my headache.
Don't die.
Today, we are going dancing.
I wanted to talk about it.
Is that black bag yours?
They braved the snow storm.
You should put on some clothes.
There are plenty of oranges on the tree.
I didn't know who he was.
Where are you all going?
Stay away from my motorcycle.
You're influential.
That meant no.
Would you like to be seated?
They are all college students.
I had met her many times before then.
He came to ask us for our help.
How's your wife, Tom?
I don't have all the details.
She gave an oral report to her boss.
I've never been better.
They need the money.
I'm all yours.
They are currently attending a meeting.
What do you want me to do?
I like grapes, but I can't eat so many.
Let's all go.
He's waiting for you at home.
I love gardening.
I saw a koala for the first time.
The pain is agonizing.
I catch the flu every year.
Tom started packing his suitcase.
I am a shy boy.
I missed you very much yesterday.
Tom wanted to turn over a new leaf.
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
It took one week to locate their hiding place.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
They're both right.
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
My uncle has a house in Italy.
Does this sentence sound like something a native speaker would say?
She showed him the photo.
He became a singer against his parents wishes.
She is dieting.
You need to be prepared.
Do you want this or don't you?
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
Why's everybody so quiet?
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
Do you think your car will make it?
When you go, I'll miss you very much.
Unfortunately, Tom let the cat out of the bag.
It doesn't seem possible, does it?
I hope you're not alone.
They are very interested in astronomy.
I am terribly busy because the report deadline is near.
That hotel was very near the lake.
Could you just please answer the question? We don't have all day.
You need a key to open the box.
Does he have a girlfriend?
I must leave early tomorrow.
His grandfather bought him the expensive toy.
Don't push me.
The dog was out of breath.
I want to find true love.
It's just not worth it.
He owns a lot of land.
She has her faults, but I like her.
We tried them all.
If you turn on me like that, I won't say another word.
He went to Boston by car.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
Nobody knows it's my birthday today.
It was nice of you to come all this way to see me.
We're finally alone.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
They lost their dog.
That would be a waste of her talent.
I didn't see you until now.
I almost passed out.
The air we breathe consists of oxygen and nitrogen.
They walked down the street singing a song.
These logs are heavy.
You can't leave me hanging.
I had to call off the party.
He may be sick in bed.
I'm not particularly worried.
I felt safe.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
Heat expands most things.
No one can tell what will happen in the future.
He broke out into rage.
You owe me thirty bucks.
His house was small and old.
Do you have to go now?
Make sure you turn everything off before you leave.
It is too good to be true.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Don't despise others because they are poor.
He caught them stealing apples.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I was busy cooking.
My computer's acting up.
My father stopped smoking.
Tom may not be wrong.
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
It's very clean.
Let's get on the bus.
It's snowing here.
Tom's asleep.
Tom is driving.
You may leave your bag here.
Do you really mean that?
I think this belongs to you.
Eating too much is bad for your health.
Tom took another sip.
Our city police have a new campaign targeting drunken driving.
You're spoiling the mood.
You're amazing.
I think she is sick. She has a temperature.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
I am a masochist.
Do you still believe that?
Have another drink.
Where did you get your hair done?
Don't get sidetracked.
I have no books to read.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
As far as I know, he's a nice guy.
How did you celebrate your birthday?
I just love that kind of stuff.
She turned against her old friend.
I rescued you.
You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
I want you to find out about that.
He is a famous composer.
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.
My father is going to go abroad next week.
Tom put the coins into the box.
Have they spotted you?
I've got a lot of things to do this week.
As a matter of fact, I dislike him.
Take off your wet clothes.
Your English has improved a lot.
He peddled his "miracle cure" to desperate cancer patients.
I'm not the only one with a child.
She is more wise than clever.
I don't know what's happening.
Are you American?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
Do you want some of this?
Lend me as much money you can.
It's so imprecise.
I hear that Tom really speaks French well.
The car crashed into the wall.
Tom and Mary are getting ready to go out.
I know that I can count on you.
I shouldn't have wasted my time reading that.
Where's the restroom?
I thought he had died.
We're on the same side.
She doesn't know what she really wants.
Will you help me for a minute?
He failed to come on time.
Why don't you ride with me?
She's not in the mood.
He speaks English very well.
She was born last year.
Tell them we need an ambulance.
I'm aware of that possibility.
There was something about that house that made her stop and look again.
My sister still lives with our parents.
We are Australians.
He bit his lip.
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
I'd like to see your sister.
In due time, his innocence will be proven.
Why would Tom be here?
The questionnaire form was distributed properly.
He's a man of his word.
He tried to put the blame on me.
The recent events have affected him deeply.
There were no fingerprints on the knife.
We didn't get paid this week.
I'm glad you're my friend.
I wish I had a better memory.
I'm coming at once.
Did he show you the picture?
I remember the horror I felt when she screamed.
Do you like Indonesian food?
Tom grew up in a small fishing village.
He expressed himself very well in English.
Why did I do this?
I want to learn how.
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
Have you gotten over your cold yet?
How many computers have you had so far?
Stop putting off finding a job.
Tom's working.
I hadn't planned to tell you anything about this.
I don't want to miss my train.
I just brewed a pot.
Fallen rocks blocked the road.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
What a hassle!
Right now, I feel like talking.
He will succeed to the throne.
I don't care what you do with your money.
He called out for help.
I'm not going to lie.
It is still unclear what caused the accident.
I'm a student.
Tom tore the paper in half.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
She was advised by him on how to stay healthy.
Which one will you choose?
As for me, I am not satisfied with the result of the examination the other day.
Tom is too young for that.
She took him to the zoo.
Get your coat.
I find that very interesting.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
I like speaking in French.
I can do it in half the time.
If you don't pay rent, the landlord will evict you.
Your name was dropped from the list.
This is official.
If two people have the same opinion, one of them is redundant.
Your tea will get cold if you don't drink it now.
Stir the soup.
What a stupid question!
Certain smells can easily trigger childhood memories.
I will study German.
How can you be sure of that?
I have been to the airport to see him off.
It is high time we went to bed.
Don't you drag me into this.
It's rare to find big yards in Japan.
They eat meat once a week.
I didn't think it would matter.
He dumped me.
He just texted me.
May I see a menu, please?
He excused himself for his bad behavior.
He is making preparations for a trip.
I'm married.
Do you need any help doing that?
Beware of dog.
What a hypocrite!
I hate seeing you like this.
There are a lot of bridges in this city.
Don't stay here.
Thank you very much for your present.
I appreciate this so much.
Tom didn't wear a suit.
The streets were empty.
What are we having for dinner tonight?
You're the oldest.
That made me very sad.
He was sitting with his arms folded.
She stood there even after the train was out of sight.
Give it a shot.
Why didn't she help you?
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
We go to Boston as often as we can.
He is a doctor and a university professor.
I forgot to send you an e-mail.
I need to know your answer by Friday.
I didn't mean that literally.
Tom looked a bit surprised.
Everybody agrees with you.
He removed his sunglasses.
Do not come here.
I used to play here.
Do you ask every new employee that question?
I'm pooped.
Are you trying to make a fool of me?
I think it's time for me to do my homework.
Tom always shouts when he is angry.
It's not looking good.
I already gave it to Tom.

We all had hope.
Which one of you wasn't on the bus?
He chuckled.
You have been busy.
That's not what happened.
I'm going back.
It's hers.
I wonder if Tom ever took Mary up on her offer.
I'm not married to Tom anymore.
I can't control it.
She ate her dinner.
I could barely contain my excitement.
What's got into you?
Don't even talk to me.
What would you like to be called?
The past is the past.
The blood was bright red.
Now that you have made your decision, you must act.
I'm just a teacher.
Let's put it to a vote.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
It is truly a nice day today.

Tom's jokes are hilarious and get even better after he's had a few beers.
She didn't want to sell the book.
She abandoned her sons.
I've got to learn some new songs.
It's your book.
Tom had reasons to be angry.
You're kidding!
Are you being punished?
She breaks something every time she cleans the room.
I'm never angry without reason.
I've heard all about you.
They tried to cheer me up.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
Do you have a car?
He understands the risks.
He wants you to come home.
Get out of bed.
That wasn't what I intended.
He is constantly complaining.
Do you drink alcohol?
The prince asked the little girl why she was crying.
I like living here.
She turned pale when she heard that news.
I think Tom drank out of my glass by mistake.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm really sorry for what I said.

What did he do to you?
I agreed with him on that point.
I am tired of hearing that.

Are you seriously thinking about going?
Let Tom make the decisions.
The fog has lifted.
Don't put anything in the bag.
It is cloudy today.

She looks very much afraid.
Please follow the school rules.
That man has a bad reputation.
When did you last see my brother?
We all have flaws.
Tom is thirty years old.
She was aching all over.
Not much time is required.
I can't see you without thinking of your mother.
Where is your house?
Last summer, I spent three weeks in Boston.
It's a pity that you can't come.
I've never seen something like this.
Tom certainly had plenty of opportunities to go to concerts while he was in Boston.
Say that again.

You look happy today.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
How much is that going to cost me?
Could I have the check?

Here comes the bus.
Everything here is mine.

What did he do during the holidays?
If you're tired, rest.
You're confused.
Get your things together.
In case I am late, you don't have to wait for me.

It's sufficient.
I'll admit I'm wrong.
You're the boss.
Why don't you tell me what you remember?
Happy birthday!
I will go if you go.
How do I get a hold of you?
She must care for the old man.
Far from hesitating, she willingly offered to help me.
I thought you were asleep.
I can't force you to do anything.
She went there yesterday.
He practices medicine.
I didn't say that.
You should have told him.
I'm just a regular office worker.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
That's something that happens quite often.
I showed him the way.
You can't get there from here.

He persuaded his wife not to divorce him.
I hate my boss.
Bring me the newspaper.
I have my supper at a quarter past seven.

Those are mine.
Please say it in English.

I was discouraged.
Is he a teacher?
Don't run risks.
He is distracted.
His body was covered with brown fur.
I do like the way you think.
I wanted to make a good first impression.
I'll vote for you.
The decision is not yet final.
Tom is dreaming again.

Clean it up.
If you want to get elected, you're going to have to improve your public image.

I'd like to do some traveling.
He spoke of the people and the things that he had seen during his trip.
I can't wait to meet him.

I think that he is right.
It's up to you to decide whether we'll go there or not.
He didn't want to do it.
Everything I did, I did for Tom.
I need a pencil sharpener.
Would you lend me some money?
Tom has changed a lot since then.
Don't watch too much TV.
You weren't even there.
He was at work till late at night.
I think we've done a pretty good job so far.

You may choose either of the two books.
I feel like a rest.
Take a shower.

I don't have an alibi for Monday night.
Are you sure you have the right address?
My parents pushed me to quit the baseball club.
What a shame!
Where was your daughter?
He hesitated for a moment.
Don't worry. It's easy.
You should apologize to him for coming late.
That's the last thing you want.
She handed him the money.
They said they would accept the committee's decision as final.
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
I have been loved.
She herself helped him because no one else would.
I just decided I'd come home early.
I'm too tired to drive. Could you drive?
I want to know what you're doing here.
I would prefer any alternative to a lawsuit.
Here's to your health!
You owe me something.
You're absolutely right.
This is taking forever.

What you have said applies only to single women.
I told you I didn't want any coffee.
I'm losing weight.
What was the outcome?

Thanks for the advice.
I won't live there ever again.
I am looking forward to Christmas.
Let's hurry so we can catch the bus.
I do not deserve it.
She poured me a cup of tea.
I didn't know you had a brother.
Are you still there?
The people rebelled against the king.
Would he like that?
Do you have the book?
I have no patience.
I'm considered a traitor to this country.
That was a pretty good move.
I'm not going to go.
The children are scared.
Is there somebody you want to call?
Don't forget to pick me up at 6 o'clock tomorrow.
There are ten people in this room.
He accepted the job.
Everyone is going.
I'm not finished yet.
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
They're in the hot tub.
Tom couldn't have done it.
He is by far the best student.
It's nice to meet you.
He said he knows this secret.
You're very lonely.
I turned on the radio to listen to the news.
I have a friend who lives in Sapporo.
When the chips are down, the only one you can count on is yourself.
He had a mad crush on you.
You're not my friend anymore.
Thank you for your kindness.
I'll stay here if you really want me to.
We're ruthless.
Tom got rid of his old car.
If you only had one more week to live, what would you spend your time doing?
Hi! I'm new here.
My watch loses five minutes a day.
I forgot my pen.
Everyone in my family is happy.
We don't have a second choice.
This encyclopaedia is convenient for looking up things.
I visited the town for the first time in a long time.
The dictionary on the desk is mine.
Don't touch the glass.
Tom has lost a lot of weight recently.
They found him guilty.
He gave me what little money he had.
Will you permit me to go there?
Would you be friends with me?
How come you know it so well?
We want to be the best.
I had a checkup the week before last.
I know him very well.
It looks as if you're right.
Oh my God! What are you doing!?
How about dining out for a change?
Keep away from me.
That might not be possible.
Let me join your cause.
What would you like me to do with this?
How did you get so strong?
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit.
I almost drowned.
You're all happy.
What more could you want?
Get out.
Could you show me how to do that?
Shut up!
It's a legitimate worry.
You are to blame.
I am glad to help you.
He will be at home tomorrow.
My advice is for you to go home.
She is well-liked by everyone.
We're out of time.
He is in good physical condition.
Don't you think it's risky?
Tom wrote to a friend.
They teach Chinese at that school.
I don't really have a gun.
You're all happy.
I bought the novel on which the film is based.
This job will call for a lot of money.
Did you see it?
I am going to introduce you to the rest of the crew.
I thought you liked it here.
My father likes traveling by air.
You're just tired.
Black smoke spewed out of the third-story windows.
You'll have to stand on your toes to see.
I'm afraid you'll have to go in person.
When will you be back?
He is taller than his brother.
It looks like you've got a green thumb.
Do you want to use mine?
Don't call him now.
These are completely different opinions.
Your watch is more expensive than mine.
Tom doesn't even live in Boston.
Is it yours?
You may as well tell me the truth.
I think we can finish this later.
They went to the beach.
Is it far?
Actually, I feel like talking.
Should I continue?
I'm not a gambler.
I am married and have two children.
Tom has been blind since birth.
There is not much traffic on this road.
That didn't work.
Can I show you something?
It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
Let me do it my way.
He didn't have time to spend with his children.
The Cabinet is meeting today to discuss the crisis.
Thanks for your comments.
By the way, I think you're really nice.
She knew the teen.
I want my key back.
I'm using that cup.
You're very sophisticated.
My father gave up smoking.
He put his hands in his pockets.
That dog jumped.
Make your bed.
Tom never talks about his family.
I nearly choked on a fishbone.
I thought I had until 2:30.
You've been very kind to me.
Excuse me, is there a hotel around here?
You're a funny man.
Tom is one of the richest men in Boston.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
Take as much as you like.
This book is smaller.
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
He hates shopping.
Something wasn't right.
You need to be more patient.
Hurry up, guys.
What would you do if you were in my place?
Do you want me to be happy?
He jimmied the lock.
Final exams are two weeks from now.
Your conduct is absolutely shameful.
You are gorgeous.
When we are told not to come, we become all the more eager to go.
It's never too late to start.
We were just about to call you.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
I can't remember it.
Fill the tires with air.
It's locked.
He hit me twice.
The professor was unable to comprehend what I meant.
If you want something done right, sometimes you've just gotta do it yourself.
Remember these rules.
I got out of bed and had a good stretch.
I like English better than music.
I can't believe we finally made it.
The climate here is very similar to that of England.
Look out for cars when you cross the road.
I ran downstairs.
I'd like to study French.
She denied having met him even though we saw them talking to each other.
I fear that I might not be able to help you.
I believe you know what I mean.
They teased the new student.
I used to go fishing quite often, but now I rarely go.
I had a phone call from him.
I'm terrified.
Your shoes are untied.
I remember when I first saw you.
Will the government raise the consumption tax soon?
I used to go to that library to study.
That he is a genius is clear to everyone.
I really missed you.
Don't depend too much on others.
It went viral.
The teacher suggested that we go to the library to study.
A gun might come in handy.
People lived in villages.
His car was seriously damaged.
I left my passport somewhere.
He lost face.
I'm dancing.
I can't understand anything Tom is saying.
They were yours.
I gave my brother a dictionary.
I'm going to watch TV.
I cannot get rid of my cough.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Do I look tired?
There's an emergency.
It wasn't much of a view.
Take a book and read it.
I kind of hope it doesn't rain.
I have a much better idea.
I know you're upset.
The police are investigating the murder.
It is necessary for you to go and encourage the girl.
That's the reason I'm here.
My sister often cries.
The black telephone costs more than the white.
We're all agreed on that.
You should go home early.
I can't deal with this problem anymore.
We had better sit down here.
Tom is out in the yard, playing with our dog.
I'm eating an apple.
I am afraid they can't get along very well.
Are you sad?
Tom has put his car up for sale.
We all live in the same neighborhood.
I don't recommend eating in that restaurant. The food is awful.
Why am I not surprised?
What are some foods you can eat to lower your cholesterol?
We're wasting water.
Do you think I should go by myself?
Someone stole Tom's bicycle.
I'll be singing a song at Tom and Mary's wedding.
This book's new.
I'm not good enough for you.
What's the bottom line?
Still, the war was not over.
His face turned pale on hearing the news.
He parties too much.
How much time do you spend shaving every day?
Do you have any idea how stupid I feel right now?
He's the love of my life.
If you're happy, I'm glad.
There is no sense in your worrying about your health so much.
We're not on a date.
Have you ever written a computer program?
Some people laugh at his jokes, but others don't.
Tom borrowed my car.
Something smells good.
He grew old.
Meet me there at midnight.
All the ingredients are fresh.
Even God cannot make two times two not make four.
He became wiser as he grew older.
It's a matter of national security.
The war had united the American people.
He has enough willpower.
I'd like to stay here a little longer.
A girl appeared before me.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Come early so we can discuss the plans.
What do you call this vegetable in English?
You weren't married for long, were you?
He is an honest man and will always remain so.
Grandma is three and a half times your age.
He goes to bed at eight o'clock.
May I go home?
Unfortunately, she lives abroad.
I don't need to go to college.
Did anyone miss me?
Marriage is the union of a man and woman.
Wait here. I'll be back soon.
The word is unfamiliar to me.
Don't say such a thing.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
The road is jammed with cars.
Any paper will do.
Tom and Mary make a very nice couple.
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
You used to smoke, didn't you?
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
Why did I trust you?
It looks painful.
Why don't you drop around sometime?
You're very rude.
In case I am late, you don't have to wait for me.
Rules are meant to be broken.
Which of them is your brother?
I haven't seen you for a long time. Come and see me once in a while.
He had called the rebels traitors.
Cut it in half.
You mean a lot to me.
I beg your pardon. I didn't think this was your seat.
My father is a doctor.
Your nose is running.
We're trustworthy.
He passed the entrance examination.
He often calls her names.
The squirrel was busy gathering nuts.
My favorite music is pop music.
I have been living in Canada for almost five years.
How much is this pen?
I'd like to see you try it.
Is there anything you want to know?
Is anyone on board?
I actually don't know.
Will the train leave on time?
Are you going to attend the meeting?
I wish you were wrong, but I know that you're right.
Close the door, please.
If that were true, what would you do?
No one told me.
He got ready for departure.
We missed you very much at the party yesterday.
Don't worry. I'll do it.
What did you say?
We didn't see anybody.
I think Tom did that intentionally.
I'm not going to sell it.
There are many interesting people in the world.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
Father is having a bath.
Tom is allergic to dust.
I want to know where they hid the money.
I have no doubt about it.
He felt uneasy in his father's presence.
We had little water.
How do you know what's real?
Do you accept Visa?
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job.
A permanent costs extra.
The decision has not yet been made.
Try to get a good night's sleep.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
I really misjudged you.
My father is so old that he is hard of hearing.
She didn't have a brother.
You don't want to go down this road.
We bought a pound of tea.
Whose computer is this?
You can't do this to yourself.
Let's go and see as many things as we can.
I don't think that you should worry about it too much.
You're not the only one that was hurt.
We should wait a little.
That's lame.
I don't want you to get involved.
He was intrigued.
We need proof.
Be nice.
Tom isn't a Japanese citizen.
My watch is very accurate.
He walked away with a sad look on his face.
Just between you and me, do you love my sister?
I need to talk to him.
What are they made of?
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
Tom paid for it.
Tom has been dating Mary for about three years.
Tom might be able to fix that.
I wasn't informed.
Do you have a copy?
A small company employs 50 people.
I went there yesterday.
Do you have any tattoos?
She started for Kyoto yesterday.
Night is when most people sleep.
He graduated from Cambridge with honors.
They come from the same village.
You bought it from Tom, didn't you?
Don't you get it?
They each received a present.
He has overcome many obstacles.
Our train stopped suddenly.
She did it for the good of the community.
I told you I don't know how to do that.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
I expected you to be here for lunch.
Don't ever make me wait again.
This is what I do for a living.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
That's not our fault.
You won't be the first.
How can I upload a photo to your website?
He went hunting in the woods.
It's your responsibility.
It was so good.
You're so wrong.
She knew the teen.
Tom was lonely.
Is that all?
I think you'd better come back home.
He is still angry.
They all know.
I was wondering if you could help me.
I asked Tom why he had never gotten married.
What if you're wrong?
No one is too old to learn.
Those two children were the same age.
We need your help.
He studied the way birds fly.
I think I can sing fairly well.
Life is like a roller coaster ride.
Tom scrubbed his feet.
I want you to do some research.
Call me if something happens.
We invited him to our house.
That's really not the point.
I couldn't speak.
Let's establish some ground rules.
This sounds very interesting.
You seem happy.
I want to tell you.
They abandoned the ship.
"Are the drinks free?" "Only for the ladies."
It's said that he knows the secret.
No one asked your opinion.
There didn't seem to be a problem.
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you.
Could I have a screwdriver?
How did you know it was me?
I can't follow you.
I can't believe you did this by yourself.
It looks like you did a pretty good job.
She owes him a lot of money, but she probably won't be able to pay it back.
That's unimportant.
This is what I was looking for.
I don't think Tom can deal with the situation.
My sister has been studying in her room since this morning.
English is spoken in a lot of countries.
Which film did you see?
No one can keep me from going there.
How's your old lady doing?
The only thing that matters is that we are all together.
Tom is always watching television.
She asserted that she was right.
He was late to the appointment due to a traffic accident.
Would you show us some samples of your work?
Does that price include soup and salad?
I don't want you to lie to me.
We were surprised to hear the news.
He asked me if I were happy.
Can I have the paper when you're finished with it?
I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind.
Tom's warned me about that.
It's time to go to school.
It's a whole other ball game.
What do I care?
Don't listen to Tom. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Roosevelt and Willkie discussed the situation.
I'm too drunk.
I still have a lot of pages to read.
Everyone is special.
Tom concealed his anger from Mary.
I'm so sorry that I lied to you.
I don't remember the last time I climbed a tree.
Mary is a formidable woman.
He wants to come.
Did I break it?
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
"Do you think he will come?" "I hope not."
Can I go to work?
She says she will call you later.
That man sometimes talks nonsense.
These flowers aren't only beautiful, but they smell nice.
It was not until yesterday that I knew her name.
Can I have another drink now?
He's angry at the world.
After that, he went home.
Put it down.
You are both pretty and kind.
Please come again two weeks from today.
Tom should come right away.
I like these hats.
Tom picked some berries and ate them.
I have left you your dinner in the oven.
You're not dead yet.
I love the outfit you're wearing.
Did you do your homework?
My eyes feel gritty.
Are we prepared?
I don't think I can keep that promise.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
1989 was a difficult year.
According to legend, ghosts would appear in that forest, so people would not set foot there.
Give me a cup of coffee.
You aren't going to tell on me, are you?
It is an endangered species.
Do I look like I'm having fun?
I was fired.
I'm going to need your help.
Whose bicycle is that?
What are the children doing in the garden?
It was a national scandal.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
I'll be right back.
I am off duty today.
There is a bus stop near our school.
I'd suggest that you clean up a bit before your mother gets here.
Should we get a table?
We can't see anything.
She told him that she was leaving.
Thank you for your help.
He's very honest, so we can rely on him.
They bought a box of cookies.
Have you measured it?
Thanks.
I guess I just got carried away.
What do you like to do?
Don't talk to me like this.
I thought you had all the answers.
Is it really possible to predict an earthquake?
Tom bought three bottles of red wine.
Do you think the road is wide enough for cars?
They're not mine.
My sister has a piano.
The situation there was critical.
I think I've found enough for everybody.
We have arrived safe and sound.
Not knowing what to say, I remained silent.
Tom kept Mary waiting for a long time.
Your pencils need sharpening.
I'd like to go abroad one day.
Are things going well?
I can't tell you how much this means to me.
I wonder where Tom learned how to do that.
You're very skeptical.
I think you're being a little too careful.
They were watching television.
My wife just had a baby.
I want you to know that I meant every word I said.
He is eager to go to China.
I'm a lonely man.
I was at a movie theater.
How do you know those guys won't try to kill us?
I heard someone knocking.
Let me read the paper when you have finished with it.
How long does it take to go to the office from your home?
I thought you already had one.
Democracy encourages freedom.
We'll talk soon, Tom.
Excuse me. Can you direct me to the nearest subway station?
Do you like snow?
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
What makes you think that isn't true?
He came across this old coin in an antique shop.
You've been kissed, haven't you?
He would sit for hours reading detective stories.
I thought about calling Tom, but I didn't.
They live in peace.
I know that it is highly unlikely that anyone can help me.
We've seen it.
You can rely on him.
They carried the injured player away on a stretcher.
She may be cute, but I don't like her.
The tetanus shot hurt more than the dog bite.
I do want to be your friend.
I had no intention of going there by myself.
You look so handsome.
Do you have any kids?
My favorite subjects in high school were geometry and history.
That sounds like something you would do.
Can I have the key now, please?
It happened when Tom was in Boston.
Tom doesn't brush his teeth as often as he should.
I'm stubborn.
It wasn't exactly a piece of cake.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Father has lost his job, and what's worse, Mother has fallen ill.
I lost my glasses.
Seen from a distance, the big rock looks like an old castle.
It does seem like an excellent plan.
I admire their ingenuity.
You party too much.
He wrote to me yesterday.
I forgive you.
Combine all the parts to make one piece.
He ran out of money.
She is kissing him.
Leave my room immediately.
This one is all yours.
She was wearing dark brown shoes.
Things are only going to get worse.
She advised him to catch the first train in the morning.
I was fired last week.
You look kind of down.
He couldn't pass the examination.
She has lost weight.
This novel consists of three parts.
I built this for you.
He did not like to travel.
Is somebody there?
Do you work here?
I just don't want to discuss it right now.
Does anybody here have a corkscrew?
It's not about that.
We're the same age.
I can't figure out how to solve this problem.
I'll be there on Saturday.
Schools and roads are services paid for by taxes.
The coffee is cold.
The radio is broken.
Did I give you enough time?
The twins smiled.
Why don't you talk to me now?
I've managed to stop the bleeding.
I've never tried.
He changed his job.
What are you called?
You should be more careful.
Come along.
Can you read this kanji?
I've still got paperwork to do.
I want a refund.
The children received shoes for Christmas.
The man took the boy by the hand.
They are appealing for money to help refugees.
We'll dance.
I never thought that would happen.
They were surprised by what they saw.
Let's keep in touch.
It was Marie Curie who discovered radium.
I'm not stupid enough to lend him money.
Ecology is the study of living things all around us.
He has already gone home.
The town has changed a great deal since then.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
I don't have a pencil.
Is it really worth it?
Apples were on sale today.
The test of the new engine takes place today.
She was busy.
It's hers.

Something's not right here.
He was transported to a local hospital.
You have gone too far.
Let me pay for it.
That's very nice of you to say.
He has made a significant decision.
I was impressed with her work.
There's no need to hurry.
Don't tell anyone what we're doing.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I found the food too greasy.
You deserve a medal.
You're crafty.
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your classmates.
I owe you a dinner.
There must be a way to arrive at a diplomatic solution.
She doesn't admit that she is wrong.
No one agreed with him.
That is an actual fact.
Birds have sharp eyes.
Tom's alive.
I haven't eaten all day.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
He is selfish and greedy.
I didn't register.
Everybody's crying.
Is Tom jealous?
I'm not sure I want to do anything.
Tom's violent.
This sounds familiar.
Don't forget that we have homework.
I was in bed with the flu.
Do it when you have time.
If I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
Did you take a shower today?
I'm not totally stupid.
I have no idea who he is.

Everyone in the class climbed the hill.
She's much better today than yesterday.
Don't you play tennis?
Someone is watching Tom.
I just want you back.
Of course, he is right.
He never keeps his word.
He sometimes watches TV.
I know what I want to do.
I wish I could give up smoking.
She thinks money and happiness are the same.
Her car broke down on the way.
Leave our house.
Please show me the way to the station.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
I want to start now.
Deeds are better than words.
He's already a man.
I'm here to ask for your help.
I just received your letter.
I have no funds in the bank.
How do you know I don't know?
The pain in my stomach has gone.
There is nothing to cancel.
Be sure to bring rain gear.
This phrase seems correct to me.
I love secrets.
Can you tell us how that'll work?
I tried to cheer him up.
He is playing there.
Don't blame it on her.
Apart from his parents, no one knows him well.
To have more than one problem before him at one time makes him irritable, upset and exasperated.
I'm much younger than you.
She likes no one and no one likes her.
Let me call my lawyer.

That's not such a good idea.

Aren't you sick of eating fast food?
What trouble can he cause?
Are you seeing anybody now?
You should always do your best.
She denied having met him.
Follow the rules.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I can't afford to do that.
Watch your step, Tom.
The earth is similar to an orange in shape.
He is a genius.
I can walk to school in ten minutes.
I'm not rich enough to buy that.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
Where were we?
The door is closed.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Tell me what really happened.
Where did you sleep last night?
Is there anything else you want me to do?
The tunnel caved in because of the earthquake the other day.
In a sense, you are right.
You were fantastic.
That never used to bother me.
I'm happy to be back.
When the bomb exploded, I happened to be there.
You must get off at the next station.
They asked me for my name, my address, and the purpose of my trip.

Here's the change.
She is busy cooking dinner.
All of these meetings are in English.
This is quite shocking.
I could hardly endure the pain.
You're very stylish.
I think I've seen this movie before.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
The telephone was invented by Bell.
Why do you need it?
He did it with great zeal.
Sorry to interrupt you.

That's not the way I see it.
Is anyone looking?
He answered my question easily.
I spent the whole day in reading the novel.
She has just finished washing dishes.
This pond has a lot of carp.
I'd like to have the sauce on the side, please.

Wasn't she your girlfriend?
You don't have to answer.
What are some foods you usually eat with your fingers?
I'm glad you're here.
You speak good English.
Please refer to page ten.
Your parents were right.
Just when I was about to phone her, a letter arrived from her.
Why in the world would I want to be a teacher?
I want to see you first.
Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
I'll call you some other time.
They crushed all resistance.
I don't have any questions.
It's yours if you want it.
Put the luggage somewhere.
Tom arrived first.
Just do what I say.
I'm not in a position to give you advice.
Put it there, not here.
I don't like him.
Keep driving.
I argued with him about it.
Why didn't you call for help?
I don't know yet.
If only I'd been a little more careful!
He is the only child they have.

Speak slowly, please.
I majored in psychology.
I was just wondering how it would feel to be punched in the stomach.
Would you work for minimum wage?
I wish you'd told me before.
He was standing at the street corner.
He's always running short of cash.
A man's worth lies in what he is.
The audience could hardly wait for the concert to begin.
There is nothing more important than friends.
She is always hard at work.
It was a beautiful sunny day.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I haven't forgotten.
Is everything OK?
She's not my type.
I'll be right outside.
What kind of sports we play depends on the weather and the season.
If I'd only read the contract more carefully!
Let me check my schedule.
That's enough for today. I'm tired.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
Even if it takes you three years, you must accomplish your goal.
We watched a movie.
Hurry up, or you'll be late.
The dog barked.
Don't be disgusting.
Do you need this book?
I suppose it was a bit silly.
Do you want to come over tonight?
The student raised his hand.
We adopted an alternative method.
I'm still shopping around.
I saw him jump.
I thought it might be you.
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with her.
He hated lying.
I just want a vacation.
It's a huge mistake.
All of us stared at her.
I am out of work.
Don't look at us.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I don't know who knows.
They need the money.
You've got a one-track mind.
She removed the papers from the desk.
The floor must be kept clean.
What do you think of that?
I can't predict the future.
Do you have Time magazine?
I think you've got what I need.
I'll be back in time for my mother's birthday.
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
Life isn't fair, is it?
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I just want to make it up to you.
Choose one from among these.
I gave most of my money away.
He has enough ability to manage a business.
Tom poured some cereal into a bowl.
It's not sure it will happen.
This is Chinese food.
Please help me take this down.
Have you asked if they want one?
This isn't what it looks like.
Can I take your picture?
You need sleep.
Another bottle of wine, please.
I like your hat.
I'm not a vegetarian.
Why can't you do it?
Are you looking for work?
As far as I know, he's guilty.
What happened to my car?
I understand the reason for it.
I have a proposal.
I hope you two are happy.
Take the pan off the fire.
Tom killed Mary.
Please smile.
I refused to pay.
I woke up at five this morning.
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
You must have women throwing themselves at you all the time.
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
You'd better be careful not to catch cold.
You will not be able to catch the train.
It's Christmas.
I ordered way too much. I don't think I can eat it all.
I will drive you home.
He is a good writer.
I wonder if he will stand by me when I am in trouble.
Come get me.
My father is an early riser.
Tom registered to become an organ donor.
There was no money left in my wallet.
Are they Japanese?
Would you check the oil, please?
Tom promised never to do that again.
Why did you stop?
The weather stayed bad.
He sent his luggage in advance.
I've got to go to the men's room.
Why did you come early?
He finished drinking one beer and ordered another.
I couldn't do anything.
I'll stay home.
My boss was very strict.
We should determine what is to be done first.
Let's ask the teacher.
My favorite fish is salmon.
At least I'll die happy.
What time does the airport bus leave?
Books are made out of paper.
Is there a man in your life?
My father tried to teach us the value of work.
Am I supposed to believe any of that?
Are you going to stay long?
Do you like cats?
Tom used to be ambitious.
Is it satisfactory?
You've got the wrong person.
We have less than three minutes left.
Try it again.
You can go to the station by bus.
We're resilient.
I can't believe you actually said that.
A burnt child dreads the fire.
I wouldn't want to work in a hospital.
Your answer is right.
His attempt to escape was successful.
I am learning a little English.
Do you live alone?
They let me go.
Wasn't it supposed to snow last night?
I wanted to make you feel at home.
The dog was dying.
Thanks for your quick answer.
I was just here yesterday.
Show us the way.
Roll down your window.
We should consider a combined effort.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
You have to do it today.
This story is worth reading again.
What was it I left behind?
Father is going to undergo an operation.
You should look over the contract before you sign it.
I know every inch of the town.
It was less than fifteen dollars.
They are here.
Sorry, I can't stay for long.
3 to the third power is 27.
Tom is used to making speeches.
I have a serious problem.
I'm not so sure anymore.
You're never going to believe this.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
When are you getting out of here?
What makes you think that Tom will listen to me?
They are very big.
I need that.
I have caught a cold.
The ice gave way under his weight.
I couldn't find anybody.
What do you want for your birthday?
He has no hat on.
It's mine, not hers.
I often go to the movies.
The fire was put out immediately.
What do you have for breakfast?
I would like to be an English teacher.
I need a bigger challenge.
I'll call them.
Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library.
She doesn't talk much, but once she does speak she is eloquent.
We may as well stay here till the weather improves.
Have you heard from her?
I share the room with my sister.
I have no one to talk to.
Even an expert driver can make a mistake.
I believe you'll get over it soon.
If you're tired, rest.
She does not like him.
Pay what you want.
It's a pity you don't know how to dance.
He was so busy that he sent his son instead of going himself.
Go to your respective seats.
Will you give me some time?
What do you think now?
I was trying to talk to you.
I wish you'd called first.
Do exactly as I say.
They're dangerous.
Why would you want to do a thing like that?
Is anyone in there?
He has already finished his work.
She is connected with that company.
You're not normal.
I've got to get going.
Your children are very well behaved.
I don't know how to say it.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Tom got there long after we did.
I'm a little child.
This is sickening.
We have come a long way.
You should have done so.
Just get to work.
I don't get many visitors.
Our former home was in Sweden.
With your approval, I would like to offer him the job.
Thank you for making it so easy.
You're the only person I know besides me who is actually interested in this kind of thing.
The fishermen took photos of their catch.
Do you mind waiting for a minute?
He made up his mind.
Are you seeing anyone?
Are you sure this is what you want?
Do you really want this information to be made public?
I don't see a problem doing that.
I don't care about fashion.
We're halfway home.
You're the tallest person here.
I think it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to escape from this prison.
How many times a minute does the average person blink?
Do you have a shoehorn?
I just want to be sure.
It's not worth reading any further.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Why didn't you wait for me?
As far as I know, he won't come.
My dad thinks my boyfriend is a real whack job.
Will you please come with me?
I'll tell him when he comes here.
He shoved the letter into his pocket.
I did what was right.
It's on my desk.
He delivers newspapers.
Do you dye your hair?
Tom has a soft spot for Mary.
It's now or never.
Hold on a minute.
His appearance deceived me.
I'm punctual.
I've been asked to give this to you.
My mother allowed me to go abroad.
Tom will never forgive you.
He said that he had met her on the previous day.
This big sofa is really not suitable for a small room.
I want this photograph developed as soon as possible.
He never takes any notice of what his father says.
You seem upset.
I never had the opportunity to use it.
I just changed my mind. That's all.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
She herself helped him because no one else would.
The weather has been good until today.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Don't leave me behind!
Speak up!
I'm not good-looking.
I'm sorry to disturb you while you're talking.
We need a map.
Tom watched them carefully.
She's one tough cookie.
Do you want to do it again?
May I have a look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
How many categories are there?
This job is killing me.
Please don't forget to shut the door.
What are you going to do today?
It's an ongoing process.
I'm just another man.
I'll be counting on you to bring the drinks.
The bullet penetrated his chest, leaving him in critical condition.
I felt left out.
My friend is bilingual.
I have no friends.
She decided not to go.
It rained five successive days.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I hope she's safe.
I also went there.
We voted for the candidate.
I bought it with my hard-earned money.
You're extroverted.
Did you have fun tonight?
Where does this train go?
I think Tom has seen too much.
Please drop it in the mail if it's not out of your way.
I'm giving it to you for free.
It wasn't much of a storm.
I have enough money.
We have no options but to continue.
Every door in the house is locked.
The police used a battering ram to break down the door.
Stay thin.
These books are worth reading at least once.
You're not married, are you?
Take it easy!
I miss my cat.
He made up a story about the dog.
She went over the list to see if her name was there.
What would you like for dessert?
My father works hard because he wants to give us everything we need.
Is this time different?
Why can't I do that?
I wonder why he is so angry.
I know you've been waiting a long time, but could you wait just a little bit longer?
I love you the best of all.
I talked to him on the telephone yesterday night.
When I got out of the car, I felt like I had been here before.
Don't get fat.
I got what you needed.
I am fat.
Tom certainly fits the description that the police gave us.
Tell me about your children.
The book is small.
You don't have to do this.
Do you have enough energy?
The streetlight over there is broken.
I am not going anywhere.
He did the unthinkable.
Don't you just hate technology?
Is lunch included in this price?
The shoes are worn out.
They didn't act quickly.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Women like men who make them feel special.
How many beers have you had?
Tom talked to a lot of people.
I'm done with all of that.
Tom could do that.
You just have to do as you're told.
Who's on the team?
My cat is happy.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
Your handwriting is similar to mine.
He tried it with a friend.
We haven't seen Tom in a while.
I love everything about Tom.
I'm crazy about you.
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
Can I talk to you privately?
I don't think any of us are happy about what happened.
What's your favorite way to cook beans?
What is happiness?
This doesn't involve you.
During the rush hours in Tokyo, traffic is heavy.
I may actually have to go.
I think I know where Tom is.
I wasn't aware that you were feeling so bad.
I want to be at home.
I'd like an 80-yen stamp, please.
I'd like to come with you.
I felt a little dizzy.
Are you excited?
Please take the pants in a bit.
There's nothing better than a good novel.
She sat there in silence.
How many combat situations have you been in?
I don't particularly like her.
I understand it all now.
I have to remember to mail the letter.
I'm tired of dancing.
There is no school during August.
Tom has to go even if it rains.
He is always giving presents to his wife.
We must stick together.
That car is his.
Enjoy your holidays.
Would you like me to do something about it?
Why did you back away?
Could you get it for me now?
What're you doing today?
She's always grumbling.
Playing cards is interesting.
I'd like to go to France.
I saw Tom take your keys.
You're first.
Act like a man.
I'm popular.
What mileage do you get with this car?
When can I see you again?
How many pencils do you have?
I really wish I could be there with you.
They don't like you.
I quit smoking three years ago.
I'm too tired to think.
He seldom gets angry.
This is a DVD.
This hut is a very special place.
Do you trust her?
She has just turned twenty.
Do you eat rice every day?
He can barely read.
She wore heart-shaped earrings.
I thought you were bluffing.
Time for dinner.
I loved watching you dance.
My parents call me up every day.
That's more recent than you think it is.
Go away.
He slept with the window open.
Don't do anything you might regret.
Horses run fast.
"May I park here?" "No, you can't."
I suppose you want to ask me where I've been.
He is a pretty great guy.
He had dinner by himself.
She believes her son is still alive.
A picture of the fugitive was plastered all over the newspapers.
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
She is a friend of mine.
I can't keep up with you.
Tom didn't stay for long.
Please open your bag so that I can see what you have in it.
I want a room with a view.
Do you have work experience?
Don't you want to know where I was?
I remembered your birthday this year, didn't I?
The moon is behind the clouds.
So, do you like it?
I would like to get to know you better.
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
If all else fails, reboot the system.
I was just joking.
You're too old for me.
No music, no life.
You're all the same.
What's your name?
His mother speaks Italian.
Do you want to learn to drive?
I have books that I have reread several times.
He's not always at home on Sundays.
Please don't ever do that again.
He's a historian.
Why are we even talking about this?
It is unfair.
We're handling it.
She stood transfixed as if she had seen a ghost.
I prefer to be alone.
I found the key underneath the mat.
Will you give it to me?
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
Where do you get off telling me that?
What did you write?
Who's your boyfriend?
At last, I caught up with my friends.
You dropped something.
This is an unusual situation.
He is no friend of mine.
Do you have a cellphone?
We know how to find Tom.
They want to do this right.
His father disapproved of him.
A dolphin is a mammal.
You are twice as strong as I am.
We'll be working.
I'm not sure anything happened.
Don't drop the soap.
All I want is someone special in my life.
Do you want me to leave?
You must quit drinking.
It's an absolute waste of time to wait any longer.
She used to live near him.
He let me go.
Have you heard from him since he left for America?
I can do it myself.
She understands music.
I can't come with you.
I'm older than your brother.
A young girl was at the steering wheel.
What's all this noise?
This is a joke.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
Have you said anything about this to Tom?
This one's all yours.
When did I tell you that?
I crossed the river by boat.
What does it actually mean?
Don't be so outraged.
I must go.
Tom bet on the wrong horse.
What's the forecast for tomorrow?
I'm not exactly sure.
Know your enemy.
I love American movies.
Tom has quit using Facebook.
You can't know that for sure.
Please do not smoke here.
Would you like to have some tea?
My uncle died of cancer of the stomach yesterday.
What kind of sports do you do?
Marriage is a dinner that begins with dessert.
She went shopping.
He left in the blink of an eye.
His old cat is still alive.
I won't repeat anything you say to me.
"Give me something to write with." "Will this ball-point pen do?"
Let me be the judge of that.
The bank had the gall to charge a late fee for a payment held up when their online services crashed.
The budget must be balanced.
You don't want to get me in trouble, do you?
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
I don't know what this is.
Prove it to me.
I persuaded her to make herself comfortable.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
You may park here.
Where did you find it, at school or at home?
What he's saying is actually true.
I spent the whole day reading a novel.
You know who I mean.
I'm glad you're here with me.
They were very confused.
I turned right.
Far from being a failure, it was a great success.
What kind of man are you?
According to the TV, it will rain tomorrow.
It's still mine.
We're very different.
Of the three boys, the youngest is the most attractive.
He lost his new watch.
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
May I look at your passport?
If you're not happy, quit.
Don't be afraid.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
They blocked it.
The thief got away with the money.
He seemed to like that.
I belong to the sailing club.
Tom stared angrily at Mary.
They looked as if they would cry.
I need water.
I live pretty close to here.
I've never studied French grammar.
I won't miss Tom at all.
How big you are!
What's got into you?
He's a gentleman.
I want them alive.
It wasn't very fun.
What's wrong with you?
What high school did you go to?
I can hear the wind in the trees.
She went to the museum by taxi.
Tom began to brush his teeth.
Let's hope for the best.
I don't think that's helping.
That's my CD, isn't it?
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
When did you get this?
How long were you at the party?
I just don't want to have people thinking I'm weak.
It's an ambush!
He's a very hard worker.
He was sick, but he went to school.
Since he had a bad cold, he was absent from school today.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
I could walk.
No one disagreed.
They do it each week.
You are very insensitive.
This snake is not venomous.
Thank you so much.
The troops advanced twenty miles.
Did you go out?
Why did you call me?
He became a handsome young man.
They armed themselves with guns.
He has been drinking steadily since his divorce.
I sell shoes.
Set a thief to catch a thief.
Get me out of here.
The world has five oceans.
She made the same mistake as before.
We painted the house green.
He went back home.
There was no taxi, so I had to walk home.
I think Tom is serious.
They were lucky.
They were motivated by revenge.
Tom will try to convince Mary to accept your offer.
Tom is on his way back to Boston.
I enjoy talking with you.
Don't you ever touch me again.
Trust me on this.
I can solve this problem.
I bought a house.
I'm very happy with my new car.
Call us when you get there.
How would you reword this sentence to make it sound more natural?
I'm sorry, my father is out.
Do you really want to get more done?
She went to the airport to see him off.
Let me tell you something about myself.
How can you concentrate?
I assume you must be a close friend of Tom's.
That's what I'd try to do.
What can I tell Tom?
Do you know how to open this box?
I haven't been successful.
We aren't married.
I want you to have my land after I die.
This book isn't worth reading.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
I was born on a ship.
Turn left at the first light.
It goes both ways.
This is not funny.
I've never been to Europe.
We hurried to the airport only to miss the plane.
Tom drove Mary to Boston.
He spends all his time chatting online on Jabber.
We have a new coach and some new players.
I am not as interested in literature as you.
I'm too old for you.
If I were you, I would buy it.
I wear my old coat in weather like this.
What for?
I have read sixty pages, while he has read only ten.
They were members of the middle class.
We had lots of fun at the picnic.
I caught a glimpse of him in the crowd.
Are you certain?
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
All of the students were present.
We're working.
This story is worth reading.
We can't afford this.
In the summer, I wear cotton shirts.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
Don't say such things.
Was there a book on the desk?
If it were not for his idleness, he would be a nice fellow.
I don't think that you should worry about it too much.
I was able to visit several American homes.
They're very busy.
My house was on fire.
Are you settling in?
We made it.
I'm glad you liked it.
How do you put up with it?
She works as a nurse in the local hospital.
Check your pockets.
Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
Everybody knew she could speak English well.
Tom waited for more than an hour.
He did nothing but watch TV all day.
Tom was a great help to me.
Whenever you're in trouble or feeling down, I'll be there for you.
I like your style.
Who is the woman dressed in pink?
She decided to take legal advice.
I'm sleepy!
They can't do anything else.
They are very interested in astronomy.
Everybody is sleeping.
I'm not good at negotiating.
Try again.
Take out your notebooks.
She rubbed her eyes.
Where are the car keys?
Could you tell me what's going on?
You get out only what you put in.
Reading books is interesting.
It's brand new.
Things are not like they used to be.
Sorry, I didn't notice that.
I saw it.
I put my family before my career.
He did well in all subjects and, above all, in mathematics.
You're selfish.
Would you like to sleep a little longer?
Wouldn't you like to get some fresh air?
Wow! It's been a long time.
I met a friend.
That's a joke.
I'm too busy.
I was only teasing.
I really wish you wouldn't do that.
We often play cards on Sunday.
I've been very busy since the new term started.
Where's the nearest pharmacy?
I need a drink first.
They made the right choice.
Why don't you quit?
I don't know when I can take a break.
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.
My father is going to make a trip to New York.
What an inspiring speaker!
I require your assistance.
Do you want to leave?
I want the fan.
This is for you, Tom.
Do you know this place well?
Tom's afraid.
She has no self-esteem.
I don't want my mother to worry.
Would you mind letting me see your passport?
Some people read books to kill time.
Do you plan to go abroad?
I never told you to quit.
It's difficult to learn Greek.
Where do you want these suitcases?
I think I can prove it.
What're you all dressed up for?
He found his father lying in the kitchen.
We will leave as soon as he comes.
Don't go near the dog.
She has put her house up for sale.
I got up early in order to catch the first train.
He said that he would help me.
We'll talk about it later.
She was already in love with him.
He is not very good company.
I've only seen it once.
Come home early.
A dolphin is a kind of mammal.

Let's play truth or dare.
I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
This hall was full of people.
We've all got ears.
We had a heavy rainfall last night.
Are you playing games with me?
Have you been told the reasons why we didn't hire you?
He didn't see anything.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
The children are riding their bikes.
How many kinds of vegetables do you grow in your garden?
You're not upset, are you?
Is something else going on here?
I believe in the immortality of the soul.
I have absolute trust in you.
Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?
Where is Tom's classroom?
Did you write that?
Do you want something?
Whose are they?
I can't go to the mall.
Doing that will take a long time.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
I'm 19.
I was invited by an old friend.
You're being silly.
What would you have me do?
It's pitch black outside.
Please keep my place in this line.
We don't always agree.
Your name sounds familiar to me.
You can't buy this medicine without a prescription.
You don't want this, do you?
How many books do you read per month?
The snow has melted.
That's what I wanted.
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
Would you please open the window?
I had to make a decision.
What's all that racket?
Do you want any of these books?
You may go where you please.
What's the matter with you?
I have an ever growing list of to-do items.
You can't get rid of me.
Go to the store.
This is it.
I like learning ancient languages.
You despise Tom, don't you?
I found it easy to solve the problem.
Tom stopped it.
I pretended to work.
Do not open your book.
The policeman said that it looked like a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
Bring your friends with you.
I want to get Tom something nice for his birthday.
I can walk.

I don't want to hear any more excuses.
What can you see?
He is not going to get ahead.
Are you looking for something?
She's got more books.
A car has one steering wheel.
Sorry, I've got to go.
She made it clear that she couldn't make it in time for the meeting.
This is the shortest way to the station.
Live and learn.
I do my homework after school.
I miss college.
Have confidence in yourself.
I brought mine.
I really don't want to play.
It sounded easy.
Take one of these.
He can speak just a little English.
Do you like the way you look?
Did you read it all?
You have to go.
I thought you were injured.
I'll do what the boss tells me.
His incompetence began to irritate everyone.
Don't dwell on your past mistakes!

It'll snow tomorrow.

Mary is young enough to be your daughter.
You heard your mother.
I have only one sister.
I outwitted him.
I can't figure out anything.
Is he busy?
What does this image make you think of?
It was horrendous.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
We haven't been invited yet.
Do what he says.
I wouldn't tell Tom about that if I were you.

I just want you to listen.
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?

You're foolish.

You were beginning to worry me.
Yesterday was the last day of school.
He was absent because of illness.
Do you think you can help Tom?
I was overwhelmed.
We're working as fast as we can.
I need to be alone for a while.
That'll take a couple of hours.
Can we speak French?

This is a very entertaining story.
Stop!
They were very excited.
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover.
What choice do we have?
There's no way out.

I like to talk.
I know how badly you want it.
Calm down.
Did he ask you to spy on me?
You're very stylish.
Tell me which one to choose.

I'm done with you.
He handed the letter to the secretary.
Maybe I should go with you.
Are you still up?
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?

What are your plans for the night?
I want you to return to your seat.
Maybe we should just give up.
He speaks English with a German accent.
Drive on.
I'll go ahead.
Any of you can do it.
Can you make it safe?
Don't act like a know-it-all.
We're both writers.
Dinner's ready.
What's wrong with them?
I wish I had more time to talk with her.
It would be a good idea if I went.
She was bewitched by his smile.
Tom's famous.
We're finally alone.
May I smoke here?
He put a hand gently on her shoulder.
They lost again.
Read what's on the label.

Don't worry, I'm going to help you.
I saw a girl with long hair.
My eyes are very sensitive to the light.
Tell me the story.

What did you open it with?

What's the weather like where you are?
Do you need the phone?
They're all on vacation.
I know all this.

Get in the boat.
He is to come to my house tonight.
He lost his eyesight in an accident.
Didn't you go out?
I wish I could write as well as Tom.

I have simply nothing to say about it.
Who was it that bought this skirt yesterday?
Tom isn't the only one here who's a good singer.

He's very young. He's much younger than Tom.
I didn't hear you come in.
Something very unusual seems to be happening in the park.
"This used to be such a friendly place." "Tell me about it."

His job is to teach English.
I stayed with an American family.
I don't need any rest.
I met him several times.

Close the box.
Did I break it?
I was living in Boston a few years ago.
I thought you were injured.
I must speak with you alone.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Be punctual.
The arrow hit the target.
She often takes advantage of his ignorance.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up.
That's an excellent choice.
Do not forget to turn the light off before you go to bed.
The maid made my bed.
That's a horse of a different colour.

Don't do anything like that again.

Be polite to your parents.
We are happy.
Hurry up, please.

I have bad news for you.
I'd like to know when you plan to give me back the scissors I lent you.
The barber gave him a haircut.
Why aren't you talking to me?
Hold on a minute.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
She is cooking for him.
Stay out of my business.
It was just a joke. Lighten up!
I advise you wear a heavy coat.
My sister plays the piano every day.
You dropped something.
You're very attractive.
Do you intend to answer all my questions truthfully?
Stop harassing me.
That river is dangerous to swim in.
His nose is his best feature.
We had a slight difference of opinion.
It's still alive.
I have a little something for you.
It isn't just for show.
Don't ask too many questions.
The last time when I saw him, he was quite well.
I'd like to talk to the doctor alone for a moment.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
You were at home yesterday, weren't you?
Hi, guys.
This is kind of embarrassing.
How is it possible?
I hope he sees this.
This cloth feels like velvet.
Let's sing a song.
You have my mug.
This is what he said.
She married a hotshot lawyer from New York.
We don't know for certain.
I'll be your teacher.
I took care of that.
How did your dog get in here?
This is my notebook.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
That is my opinion.
I don't expect to be gone long.
He said it as a joke.
Poaching is not allowed in national parks.
Human relationships are very complex.
I don't have any books to read.
We can not learn Japanese without learning Kanji.
We had a very good time indeed.
The man who is constantly making decisions and being compelled to alter them gets nowhere.
Let me handle it.
You'll be the first to know.
I said it might rain.
I think it's Tom.
I'll be grateful to you if you can do that for me.
I thought we were best friends.
Tom bet $300 on the game.
Few students knew his name.
He is the head of marketing.
He said he was poor.
That's not a bad decision.
Is the window open?
I want to go.
Do you think so?
I admire you.
Do you feel like a drink?
We're not desperate yet.
Please translate this sentence into Japanese.
He was accompanied by his girlfriend.
Some of them are teachers.
That man looks familiar.
You can rely upon him.
I couldn't tell you why.
Do you have psychic powers?
I want you to promise me something.
I feel wonderful.
She had her hair cut short.
Classes will resume Monday.
I'd like your permission to use it.
I had him write the letter for me.
I'd like to have a glass of water.
Laughing is really good for you.
I'm fed up with this weather.
I have gained weight.
She thought of a good way to make money on the Internet.
Tom ate quickly.
Do you like Moscow?
Don't be ashamed of who you are.
How many tractors did you sell last week?
We're going to begin.
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy.
Right at that instant, the bus stopped.
I thought you didn't want to go.
I didn't even notice you were there.
Be careful about what you eat.
That almost sounds like a threat.
You didn't tell me everything.
How are you?
Can I see the special exhibit with this ticket?
We'll talk again in the morning.
I've got to see you.
May I borrow this pen?
I think we should sit down.
Has he paid back the money you lent him?
I tried to warn you.
I was beginning to lose my cool.
I didn't really believe it.
Unfortunately, I have to disappoint you.
In judging his work, we must take his lack of experience into account.
I don't know how to swim.
We're not rich.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
You're so picky.
You must know Tom pretty well.
She married young.
Can I come in?
I don't like to clean.
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang.
Tom is an idiot.
We'll have loads of fun.
Tom apologized.
He deceived me.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
I was ready.
Mary looked beautiful to Tom.
I met someone the other day that I think I could fall in love with.
Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do.
Just pretend I'm not here.
This book will awaken your imagination.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
I wish we'd bought another bottle of wine.
How many close friends do you have?
I've got things to do.
I've always fed my dogs in the early evening.
Do you think he's sensible?
That's good enough.
I want children.
The walls were painted light brown.
He has a good reputation.
I ought to have told her the truth.
She betrayed you.
I hope Tom never gets out of prison.
Tom isn't bothering me.
It's garbage.
The apprentice is lazy.
We make a great team.
I found my car missing.
You're very lonely.
I don't mind if you smoke.
I haven't eaten anything yet today.
I made it myself.
I don't think we can really say that one is right and the other is wrong.
I was able to find out his address.
She reproached me for being lazy.
You can still change your mind.
This is what you must do.
I hope you're wrong about this.
I love apples.
It looks like it's going to be sunny.
Is your mother at home?
Compare your answer with Tom's.
Because of the snow, the train didn't run.
I'll get by if I have a place to sleep.
Wash up.
Tom said that he was innocent.
What do you want to do?
I think everybody's happy.
Walking along the street, I met an old friend.
I am delighted to be here.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
I'm not hiding anything from you.
Would you like to go see a movie with me?
Tom doesn't live here.
That was very good.
Don't follow me.
The birds sang.
I'm going to go take a nap.
How did your test go?
The door remained closed.
I think Tom will win.
I don't know how long this'll take.
You still haven't told me why you're here.
We haven't had any major accidents.
You'll have a hard time.
Everyone got something for Christmas.
We're home early.
It may sound strange, but it is true.
It's a Chinese company.
The man committed murder.
Please reserve this table for us.
He looked me in the eye.
Autumn is here.
It is I who am to blame.
I never told anyone.
I think it's a good idea.
He resembles his father very much.
She gave me a smile of recognition.
I'm going to have to ask you to put your phone away.
I promise you I'll come early.
I don't want to get married.
She regarded me suspiciously.
Something wasn't right.
Have you been mistreated?
I know who you are.
My wife's going to kill me.
I don't want you to worry about anything.
I think they like us.
Please don't tell anyone.
We'll probably all be dead soon.
I came from China.
I really don't want to do that.
Don't make me do this.
Come and have tea with me.
My father stopped drinking.
What have you done with my bag?
I can hear you.
Aren't you a little young?
I'm smarter than you.
You're home early, aren't you?
I've always wanted to be a mother.
Don't worry about a thing.
Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you.
Are you sure you're up for it?
He lifted her in the air.
I got remarried.
There was nothing to burn.
I believe in you.
There is an urgent need for more people to donate their time and money.
Do you need to drink wine?
I was walking to the station then.
Don't trust him, no matter what he says.
I went to every modern art show that took place in Tokyo last year.
I'm from Brazil.
You've often said so yourself.
Did you catch what he said?
Do you trust her?
I'm involved.
I got this as a wedding gift, but I've never used it.
She stared at him and that made him very nervous.
The default value is zero.
She is very cynical about life.
Get out of here immediately!
He ran outside naked.
Fasten your seat belt.
I thought you'd gone home.
Haven't I already told you about this before?
Your bath is ready.
This is very useful.
I don't think Tom is listening.
I remember reading about it.
No one cheated.
I turned the lights out.
There is an urgent need for understanding how climate change will affect our lives.
I'm afraid so.
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.
It was your idea.
He kept me waiting for an hour.
Your paper contains too many mistakes.
What is the main purpose of your studying English?
The dogs barked all night.
We need to get out of here.
I can't wait for spring to come so we can sit under the cherry trees.
Are you already married?
Don't ever lie to me again.
I am off today.
He plays tennis very well.
This isn't funny.
Japan relies on Arab countries for oil.
Please smile.
How could it have exploded?
I'm glad to be of some help to you.
I appreciate that very much.
Would you like me to call you a cab?
She married him even though she didn't like him.
That's all they had.
That last round of chemo really sapped his energy.
They shook hands when they met at the airport.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
Would you please stop talking?
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
If you go hiking in the desert, be sure to take plenty of water.
I can't thank you enough.
Tom was shot in the head.
He talks as though he knew everything.
You'll have to study harder from now on.
I always wear a watch so I know what time it is.
There was a bridge across each river.
I'm not going to disappear.
Tom has an American accent.
I find him intriguing.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
She went with him to the zoo.
We sat face to face with executives.
As soon as I can get the chance, I'll help your mother paint the fence.
I thought you were injured.
No one says that.
When it comes to fishing, he's an expert.
Do you like apples?
There is no need for us to hurry.
They found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.
She decided on a blue dress.
It's warm in here.
She sells vegetables.
Do you know why?
Our work never ends.
I was angry at myself.
How many of them survived is not known.
Why don't you loosen up?
We acted in good faith.
We're survivors.
I had no idea you felt that way.
Just try it out.
We need to finish what we started.
He made me a new suit.
They canceled.
I may be gone for a while.
If you could do it, would you do it?
Tom pretended to be Canadian.
I know this will work.
We're all right now.
I said I'd be there.
A heavy stone slab was lowered over the grave.
I just got here this morning.
Don't talk to me about work.
They took a sample of my blood at the hospital.
I hope they appreciate it.
How many of your students are here?
Are you guys OK?
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
I'm going to let Tom respond.
I know you've been busy.
What do you associate with summer?
I already know.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
They mistook him for his brother.
I want to be a pilot when I grow up.
Tom dug a hole in the sand.
I think Tom was looking for you.
It's already seven.
I'll eat standing up.
This is a beautiful house.
I followed you.
Are you interested in me?
We're so glad to have you here.
I fed the dog.
Smoking in bed is dangerous.
I'm not a teacher.
I took it for granted that you would come to my party.
If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it.
He was known to everybody in the village.
Don't touch anything.
We saw you.
No one was on board the ship.
Did you call me up last night?
Behave yourself.
Tom asked Mary who had been the first to arrive.
My father has many books.
I haven't read his novel, and my brother hasn't either.
Don't worry about what I did.
I've done all that.
What's the first thing you're going to do?
I had quite a busy day today.
The kettle is boiling.
Stop reading.
What do you have to do?
Italy has some of the best art galleries in the world.
I don't know what I'm doing.
She spends her leisure time making dolls.
I love you and I will always love you.
I just want to help you relax.
What happened to my car?
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
You may talk as much as you like.
This is a disaster.
I have to think.
Those are all great ideas.
We are all set.
The man couldn't so much as write his own name.
I want each of you to take out a piece of paper and write down what happened.
The new Harry Potter movie is pretty lame.
Here are some letters for you.
He has good eyesight.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
You reap what you sow.
We really enjoyed ourselves.
Have you ever thought about quitting your job?
I am better.
We'd better get out of here.
Your answer is right.
The police persuaded the criminal to surrender his weapon.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I don't mind helping you clean up after the party.
I want to know why.
I wouldn't want anyone to read my diary.
I have everything I need.
I'll leave everything to you.
You are as tall as my sister.
Are we talking about the same Tom?
Could you stop, please?
It happens all the time.
I always have room for dessert.
Flour is made from wheat.
You can't keep doing this, Tom.
Tom said he won three hundred dollars.
Don't take it out on me.
I want Tom to go get me something to eat.
We just landed.
I'm outraged.
My husband is lazy.
They made their way across the river.
It looks like it's just the two of us.
Let's see you talk your way out of this one.
She said that she saw a suspicious man.
I can't explain what happened.
Tom tried to leave.
I'll get rid of it.
I called you.
It is wrong to steal money.
That reminds me of something I heard yesterday.
Can you shut the door on your way out?
He asked his friend for advice.
There is an urgent message for you.
I forgot the book.
That's absolutely right.
Perhaps he will come.
Do you still believe I killed my brother?
I finished last.
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
We need an answer.
He lost his sight in the accident.
Everything is ready.
You're finished already.
You're German, aren't you?
You've been warned.
Could you give us a minute, please?
He is looking for a job.
You're under arrest for endangering the welfare of a minor.
Father translated the German letter into Japanese.
This isn't so difficult.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
Watch the road.
He is working as a security guard at a warehouse.
That's not what I asked you.
I opened the door.
Girls begin puberty around the ages of ten to eleven, and boys around the ages of eleven to twelve.
I hate dogs.
I don't feel like going out.
Death before dishonor!
Did you get her letter?
Last night I threw up.
The traffic ground to a halt.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
How did he find us?
Why don't you eat vegetables?
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
At home, we speak only French.
Everything is new.
You're not allowed to eat those.
The professor seemed to be lost in thought.
That's a student my father teaches.
He plays the piano better than me.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
Have you ever loved a man?
How long were you at school today?
I'm sure he will come tomorrow.
I need to take your pulse.
I'll be whatever you want me to be.
I'd like to join a night bus tour.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
His watch is ten minutes slow.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Did Tom say why he was fired?
I'm going to give Tom a bath.
Do you have any questions about what needs to be done?
My father doesn't eat fruit that much.
How'd you find it?
I never should've left you.
Didn't you lock up your car?
He grinned broadly at us.
Correct my spelling if it's wrong.
The gown is made of silk.
You will need a bodyguard.
I'm not denying it.
Give me a bottle of wine.
Do you have any drinks?
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
She waved goodbye to him.
Check it out!
I left earlier than my sister.
I don't gossip.
It is hard to adapt this story for children.
A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched them with sleepy eyes.
Prepare yourself.
Look into the matter more carefully.
I brought mine.
He is having lunch.
He is capable of teaching both English and French.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Mother has not cooked dinner yet.
There was an attempt on the president's life.
My cat rubbed her head against my shoulder.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
I could never do that.
That is not how we do things here.
I just figured out who you are.
No man is wise at all times.
It was all over.
I don't have time to say this twice, so listen carefully.
Eat more, or you won't gain strength.
You should go to bed early.
What did you call me?
It was not until yesterday that we noticed the animal missing.
He took over the business after his father died.
You don't have to answer.
They bought a home with a pool.
He seemed to like that.
I'll take care of you.
Tomorrow's no good.
You're crafty.
You're the laziest person I know.
That's very nice of you to say.
I traded in my old car for a new one.
Did anyone else help you?
Jackson seemed to get better.
He is suffering from a serious illness.
I have something I want to tell you.
I am very interested in music.
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
The company's insolvency forced it to file for bankruptcy.
Don't tell me you stole it.
I have questions.
I'm going on a business trip.
English is spoken in a lot of countries.
I can put up with a house being untidy, but I don't like it to be dirty.
Take off your clothes.
The bath is ready.
I really appreciate you helping me.
My boss rejected the budget for the new project.
It's been a long time since we last saw each other.
We're not dressed.
That boy is smart.
It will burn.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
If you make a mess, clean it up.
Look, I want you to do me a favor.
He walks his dog every morning.
I was very careful.
I'm just tired.
Everyone sat down.
I hope my new stepfather sticks around longer than the last one.
The price is low, but the quality isn't very good.
I stayed home all day long reading novels.
We'll all be there.
I guess we were happy.
He's worried that he might be late.
That boy won't tell me his name.
The power of his physique is evident to all who look at him.
How come you don't know this?
This theory is too difficult for me to comprehend.
I didn't even get a postcard.
What do I call you?
I want you to be my friend.
He thanked her for her kind help.
Whenever my uncle comes, he brings some nice things for us.
His face brightened.
We could sing together.
My father's going to kill me.
Tom has a big mouth.
We were impressed.
Tom spoke into the microphone.
Lighten up.
He bought his daughter a dress.
The problem's being looked into as I speak.
I'm really busy right now.
It's not a big deal.
Is ten thousand yen enough?
After she had lunch, she got ready to go out.
This doesn't make sense.
They danced until six in the morning.
That company went bankrupt.
I think maybe we should go.
They were afraid of being overheard.
He watched the horse race with his binoculars.
Don't drink out of my glass.
They were admiring themselves.
I just can't wait to go to school.
You aren't as short as I am.
I figured I'd find you here.
She will be there by now.
Your bath is ready.
Stop resisting!
Would it help me?
It wasn't enough.
I will try to live up to your expectations.
I'm dissatisfied.
A new topic came up in conversation.
I saw what you did.
She gave me her phone number.
I'd recommend taking a break.
Outside the school, she saw people with no homes living in cardboard boxes.
Isn't Tom a little old for you?
I want to have a proper house and garden.
Do you take work home with you?
Keep your eyes on the road.
When are you getting out of here?
Who is it that you're working for?
You should have helped him with his work.
I want to check out now.
A truck was standing in the middle of the road.
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.
Tom is poor, but he's happy.
I don't like being controlled.
Did you hear the noise?
How do I report a theft?
I have to go to the city.
I ran to my mother.
It's shockingly inexpensive.
Are you a student?
Come here and help me.
I really tried.
I would rather go to the mountains than to the beach.
What foods, if any, do you avoid eating?
They're part of us.
Don't give me such a sad look.
I am afraid he will fail.
He looks very sleepy.
They should have the right to decide for themselves.
There's a rumor in the air that the firm is going into bankruptcy.
Our train went through a long tunnel.
Have something to drink.
I hate long goodbyes.
Tom prefers not to talk about it.
Don't forget your gloves. It's cold.
They won't make it.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
I didn't see you.
I'll play with you.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
It looks like winter is here to stay.
I'd like to breast-feed my baby.
History is more complex than you think.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
I spoke to my uncle on the telephone.
Nice timing.
We didn't know the whole story at that time.
How did the exam go?
What do you believe now?
He is boiling with rage.
I want to retire.
I won't betray your trust.
Please fix my toy.
Tom began coughing.
I'm worried about them.
Let's go in my office.
I intend to go to the barbershop.
We thought that we wouldn't be able to stop him.
Come if you can.
They showed it to our company.
Let me get my wallet.
It's a no-brainer.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
Could you recommend a nice restaurant near here?
Tom spoke to the doctors in French.
I found these.
I don't know if he would have done it for me.
I realized what was happening.
I'd say you did well.
I find you attractive.
Could you give me a discount?
He is too young to go there alone.
The door swung open and Tom walked into the room.
The teacher supervising the playground became concerned when she saw a man talking to some of the children over the school fence.
No man can serve two masters.
I have a decision to make.
She sent me a present in return for my advice.
Could someone hand me a knife?
I think it's dangerous to swim in this lake.
Could I have a knife and fork, please?
Did you hear that?
Tom called his wife to say he'd be late.
Please turn off your engine.
I think you're being a little too careful.
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
Tom called Mary at about 2:30.
We can talk in front of Tom.
Do you drink green tea?
There's a fire in the building. We have to evacuate immediately.
He was impatient to see his daughter.
Drivers must look out for children crossing the road.
She lost interest in her work.
I'm going to have to call you right back.
Tom pointed out my mistake.
It was stupid of me to believe that!
Tom got special treatment.
She kept working.
I think it's time for me to lose some weight.
I beat him at chess.
You should always spend time doing things that help your children get ahead in life.
Where did you have in mind?
I had to keep my secret.
All three of us agree.
She urged him to study harder.
Do your very best.
This happened to us, too.
I underestimated you.
He was sitting there.
I like my teachers.
Don't you drag me into this.
I like English better than I like mathematics.
Please push this button at once in case of emergency.
You may come in now.
I don't know either of the two sisters.
You may be needed.
Try another door.
I thought about writing you a message, but never got around to it.
He came out on top.
Cut it out!
She advised him to go to the hospital.
No one would've listened.
How do you know they're looking for us?
He made up his mind to go there.
It's routine procedure.
She ran out of paper.
They're not dead.
Tom was beginning to feel tired.
Get back here.
The train left two hours ago.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
Are you their mother?
Toudaiji is the bigger of the two temples.
We were in Boston.
Tom loves Mary.
It's just pepper spray.
Where are we exactly?
She has legally divorced her husband.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
Your dog is here.
Your phone is ringing again.
I'm just looking around.
You're opportunistic.
You're the one who trained me.
We could meet downtown. Would that be convenient for you?
Don't drink too much, okay?
We could all be dead tomorrow.
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
Who hired you?
Close your eyes.
This is a rental car.
I'm claustrophobic.
She decided to marry him.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
May I assist you?
You want me to show you how to do it?
I'm calling for help.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Don't go without a hat.
I am a Japanese.
He avenged his father's death.
I think it's worth the risk.
People once believed the world was flat.
I'll drive you somewhere.
He keeps surprising me.
He made up that story.
You don't have to lie.
We appreciate your cooperation.
I think I did well.
You're not supposed to be in here.
You must stay.
I know you didn't really want to come on this trip.
How is your family name written?
Have you ever been hypnotized?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I like this city very much.
Anybody can do that.
I was just in time for the last train.
There is no hope of his recovery.
Give me a definite answer.
Where did they go?
I'm no longer sleepy.
Now that you know the truth, perhaps you'll feel better.
Let me congratulate you on your victory in the tournament.
I'm not home on Sundays.
They're dying.
I don't know when she got married.
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
Tom did all he could do to help.
There is no point in pretending to be sick.
I have a surprise for you, sweetheart.
Never choose a vocation just because your friends are in it, nor refuse another just because your worst enemy is in it.
I really do love your tie.
Please keep it under your hat.
If you can see your breath when you exhale, you know it's cold.
That's how I found out about it.
We put sugar in our tea.
Has Flight 123 arrived?
I will see to it that everything is ready in time.
We can make some money.
We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.
I watched the whole thing.
You missed a spot.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction.
Is that all clear?
Where is his family?
Most experts think a lot of his theory.
What does this mean?
Obviously, you volunteered.
Let's discuss what happened last night.
Drink some tea.
You know too much.
He has worked out a quicker way to get the job finished.
They all scoffed.
Do you know the family?
When my mom finds out, she won't be happy.
Tom and Mary want to learn French.
You don't have to work on Sundays.

I didn't stop.
Why do you need this money?
How about I do that?
They hugged.
I do not like him either.
Tom joined our group.
I won't need luck.
There's no film in this camera.
She wrote him a long letter, but he didn't read it.
I'm letting you go.
In the summer, it is very hot here.
Your daughter's on drugs.
I admit this may not be the best way of doing it.
What does this remind you of?
Could you please tell me who you are?
There's no room under the bed.
This is Tom's room.
I don't have a lot of time.
I made some mistakes on the test.
It's hard for me to express ideas through words.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
I'm having the time of my life.
Well, tell me what you know.
I hate them all.
Don't you think it's weird?
It's very valuable.
Hey, where did you two come from?
I want a massage. I need to relax.
Was there an autopsy?
The meeting went well.
I really need this.
In my city, there is no school for learning Esperanto.

I really do appreciate it.
Hey, you're not Tom.
He bought her some chocolates.
Open this door.
Do it right away.
I love that story.
Tell the maid to make the beds.
I hate this game.
Do you think he will like that?
Didn't it occur to you to shut the windows?
Don't eat without me.
Have you seen enough?
I know you feel lonely.
I need money.
I hope everything went well.
Don't be so greedy or you'll wind up with nothing.
I had to look after the children.
I don't think it's odd.
This is all I know.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
We have a lot of rain in June.
How is your mother?
You're stubborn.
You may go.
She helped me out countless times.
It is of great value.
Do you live in the city?
What a bunch of idiots!
He left his keys in the car.
Please close the door.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
The country's economy is about to collapse.
Are you sure about that?
Read over your paper before you hand it in.

He is hunted by the police.
There's nowhere to hide.
School's not fun.
I'd like to give you something.
I pigged out on pizza.
My mother went shopping, didn't she?
I just love that kind of stuff.
He has a nose bleed.
I can't disclose that information yet.
How tall is he?
There'll be a problem.
We missed you.
The clock struck ten.
All of our attempts failed.
I need to be here all day.
She asked me whether I know how to sew.
She ignores him completely.
He was easily able to solve the problem.
I don't really want to talk about that.
The old man sometimes talks to himself.
I thank you.
I'm not really that interested.
Cheer up!
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
We can see the island in the distance.
They were better than I expected.
Tom can't carry all those suitcases so you should help him.
He eats too much.
Maybe we can talk about that later.
I don't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I hope everything went well.
I'm allergic to cats.
Tom and Mary were frightened.
Tom is persistent, isn't he?
They make a great team.
Why are you asking this?
Leave me.
They set fire to their neighbour's house in revenge.
My dog is pregnant.
I participated in the discussion.
Promise me you'll never do that again.

She might have met him yesterday.
I'd like to ask you to help me.
This is a portrait of my late father.
Are you getting enough oxygen?
Hurry up, or you will miss the bus.

Have you called her yet?
I'm glad you could make it.
They are Christians.
I think Tom wants Mary's job.
I'm not intimidated.
Is that seriously what you think?
I can't go in there.
He's gone into hiding.
That won't work!
I'm going to give you one more chance.
I've got some things for you in my suitcase.
England and France are separated by the English Channel.
I want an explanation.
Let me go!
You've underestimated Tom.
I want kids.
That is mine.
He mocked me.
You can't save me.
I oppose it.
He is asleep.
No one knew who owned the land.
You say you want to go to Boston? Why in the world would you want to go there?
I didn't want this to happen.
I'll be fine if I take a little rest.
Curiosity got the better of him.
That kiss was amazing.
I have to take the chance.
I never thought anything of it.
Let's not forget the real reason we're here.
Is your dog mean?
She turned him down.
He blamed me for not coming.
I want to continue this discussion tomorrow.
I'm looking forward to that.
He wrapped his arms around me.
I'm glad no one got hurt.
I can't figure out the answer to this problem.
Did they find anything?
There is a chance that he will pass the exam.
Please stay within earshot.
Stop staring at me.
When I was your age, I had a girlfriend.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
We're so sorry.
This semester I failed two students for plagiarism.
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself.
Will you sell your car to me?
Thank you very much for your letter.
Do you have any others?
She is capable of anything.
On behalf of my classmates, let me say a few words of thanks to you.
This is why I hate him.
I knew too much.
I can't see anything from here.
I avoid going there late at night.
The implications are frightening.
We're getting divorced.
We discussed the problem all afternoon.
I want to please you.
Your daughters are beautiful.
What are you smiling at?
Tom was convinced, but not me.
I am not happy with my job.
If only I'd done my homework!
I'll be there in a second.
I think Tom is hurt.
That sounds like something you would do.
Every time I make a mistake, I learn something. The challenge is not to keep making the same mistakes over and over.
He left his daughter a great fortune.
I went to a shoe store yesterday.
I want to test my limits.
I'm three years younger than you.
We've got to talk seriously.
Who's your father?
In my job I have to deal with all kinds of people.
Which one of you is the psychic?
I'm going to start over.
I would like an air-conditioned room.
I just don't want to die.
I'm not busy anymore.
Your cat is overweight.
Is there something in particular that you want to see?
I think Tom is a student.
He never loses hope.
How do you handle stress?
I'm not completely naive.
What don't you have?
What happened? The car's slowing down.
Did anyone call me?
I had some free time, so I wandered around town.
She looked back on her childhood.
Tom didn't know their names.
I was watching TV then.
I wanted to watch you die.
Is that enough?
You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?
I think we should get back to work.
She is as beautiful as her mother.
Why don't you leave him alone?

I'm playing with my friends.
Tom got stung by a jellyfish.
Hang on.
You sound tired.
Please open it.

I have nothing in common with her.
The fire was extinguished at once.
Whales are classified as mammals.
He's a little rusty.
I'd rather not go out this evening.
She had a great attachment to that old house.
I'm still thinking about it.
What happened to you last night?
Please hurry up!
She, of all people, wouldn't do such a thing.
I haven't started.
I just don't want you to get upset.
I'm sorry for what I did.
The offer is too good to be turned down.
Are you close to your family?
You're the teacher.
Where do they live?
I'll pay you back the money I owe you next week.
Tom has changed very little.
I want to cook for you.
I made a list.
I have to brush my teeth.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
Judge for yourself.
It's more dangerous than I thought.
There's nothing here.
She burst into tears.
What're you getting all excited about?
Don't ask me why.
Do you want any?
I prefer mutton to beef.
He seemed unconscious of my presence.
Repetition is the mother of learning.
Does that price include soup and salad?

I won't do that unless you want me to.
I want you both to get them.
The thief cut the telephone lines before breaking into the house.
I am happy to hear your voice.
Can you skip me?
Why was I not aware of this?
We were friends.
Tom could make you laugh.
He swore never to trust her again.
He will make a good team captain.
I am the same age.
Is that a cat?
It was unlocked.
I paid for these tickets.
He demands immediate payment.
Tom, are you okay?
Let's stop this fruitless argument.
She brushed her husband's hat.
Why are you worrying about something that doesn't matter so much?
This is the girl you wanted to see.
I gave him what money I had.
I'm saving money for my old age.
The tree fell down.
The room is quite small.
He countered their proposal with a surprising suggestion.
We worked together.

I don't know everybody in this school.
I'm pretty sure Tom's serious.
I made fun of him.
This custom dates back to the 12th century.
Tom had loving parents.
I'm too busy to help him.
I knew what you meant.
I let them go.
The groom left the bride standing at the altar.
History is merely repeating itself.
It might sound far-fetched, but this is a real problem.
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
I see a book.
Don't change a thing.
You and I are the same age.
Did you understand any of that?
She's so gullible she'll believe anything you tell her.
He's a bad liar.
I didn't catch your last name.
I won't cry.
Few people have typewriters.
I don't know what you mean.
A fire broke out during the night.
I teach French at a nearby junior high school.
He is in poor health.
Where's this coming from?
I haven't seen you for a while.
What kind of game are you playing?
What else?
What do you want to talk to me about?
This won't help us.
I wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday.
I can't promise anything, but I'll do my best.
I'm sorry about last night.
The scars are barely visible.
Skip the boring chapters.
I still need to talk to Tom.
I prefer plain materials.
Many people in my grandfather's generation grew up on farms.
Is there something you want to say?
Can you do it faster?
You will have a new brother.
The circus is in town.
Tell me if you're going to give it to him or not.
I figured I could count on you.
I never made such a promise.
Stop being cruel.
I have always considered you a close friend.
How do you like my new suit?
Do you have any idea how many people died when the Titanic sunk?
I was upstairs.
Can you elaborate?
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
That's exactly what Tom thinks.
I'm not the boss.
He will have to go to the station.
The terrible scene sent shivers down his spine.
Why don't you shut up?
The letter will arrive tomorrow.
There are some people who sleep in the daytime and work at night.
What do you have in your hand?
I knew you'd come back to me.
You should take the appropriate measures at the appropriate time.
Do you really want to put your money in that bank?
I'll never forgive you.
I wonder what happened to her.
Tom said he was busy.
We're going to wait in the car.
Tom is a monster.
He was trembling with rage.
Are you sisters?
Will you lend me some money?
So where were you?
Who could have spread that news?
They will help you to get warm.
I will miss you all.
Stand up, please.
I don't know what to do.
Try again.
Tom scares everybody.
You drive a hard bargain.
Maybe we can sit together.
Once he had written the letter, he sent it.
We're losing.
I read in the newspaper that he had been murdered.
How many engineers took part in the conference?
An individual is the smallest unit of the society.
Who knows what's going to happen?

The twins are very much alike.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I'm wealthy.
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?

Get rid of her.

I didn't ask you to stay with me.
He turned his attention to the picture.
I'm looking for the perfect spot to hang this picture.
It's not enough to just say you're going to vote. You need to vote.
He didn't see a thing.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
This hat's too small for you.
He became a nice young man.
When will you be back?
He's always at home on Sundays.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
We walked around the pond.
He sells cars.
I'll try to keep it short.
How is life treating you?
They made fun of my clothes.
You are under no obligation to divulge that information.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
Could we have a table in the non-smoking section?
Where did you see the boy?
We intended to stay there about two weeks.
You saw that movie, didn't you?
I think Tom and Mary are Canadians.
The plan calls for a lot of money.
I sat behind a very tall man in the theater.
How are you taking it?
I'm not that worried.
You drive a hard bargain.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
Pick one up while you can.
Just seeing it made me nervous.
We don't want to know.
The ambulances carried the injured to the nearest hospital.
I never saw her again.
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
Everything's very cheap.
Can you spare me a few minutes? I'd like to have a word with you.
She answered with a nod.
I really wasn't sure.
I appreciate all you've done for me.
Without a passport, leaving a country is out of the question.
The rainy season begins towards the end of June.
Take anything you want.
Tom looks like his mother.
To know oneself is not easy.
You're overworked.
I could sure use that scholarship money.
I will make a man of you.
That's not quite true.
I wish I had been there with you.
Try it again.
I am willing to help you.
I appreciate your telling me this face-to-face.
I thought you'd be happy.
We welcome you to our club.
He decided not to go.
The escaped prisoners are still on the run.
She spends her free time making dolls.
Apart from a filing tray full of papers on the desk, everything else in the room was on the floor.

World War I broke out in 1914.
Tom accepted the job.
Everybody was silent.
I want you to get me a soda.
The meeting was all but over.
I think it is a gift.
Can you gift-wrap this, please?
This soup is too spicy.
Get me something to eat.
I like reading American novels.
She advised him to stop taking that medicine, but he felt he needed to.
I don't think any of them know.
His car collided with a train.
Pandas are beautiful animals.
I drank the water.
I'll pay.
I eat bread.
My place is with them now.
You have to pay in advance.
I have something for you, too.
Would that be all right?
I wonder who invented it.
What do you think they're after?
I wanted you to have a little fun.
Is all this stuff stolen?
I am not sure yet if I will go to a university or get a job.
I'll take in the washing before it rains.
You didn't tell me everything.
I saw my friends yesterday.
We're all impressed.
Have you already tried not thinking of anything?
I think we need to find out who Tom plans to give that to.
Tom was getting agitated.
Let me know if you can make it tomorrow.
I just want to let you know that I can't attend this afternoon's meeting.
This work calls for a high degree of skill.
All I think about is you.
Tom has never been absent from school.
She kept smiling all the time.
I want to talk to you alone.
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was born in a log cabin in Kentucky.
Tom got up to help Mary.
I don't know him at all.
I am familiar with this subject.
His salary is double what it was seven years ago.
Who's that boy swimming over there?
It's about time you got married.
Tom always does that for me.
I want to ask you one last favor.
Some people relax by reading.
Come run with me.
Papa made sure all the lights were turned off before going to bed.
We're not sure.
Why should I go to school?
You were drunk, weren't you?
I thought you should know.
Go home. Get some rest.
How do you intend to do that?
He was very good at playing tennis.
The sky is covered with clouds.
I managed to get in.
I guess Tom is right.
I brought you a little something.
I live three blocks away.
You don't sound convinced.
I don't remember it.
You know the drill.
I'll ask him where he is planning to go during the vacation.
I think you like me.
He went shopping.
She went in to get it.
How do you know how heavy it is?
If I had gone to that restaurant last night, I would have eaten a steak.
We're all armed.
It's not just that.
He was my best friend.
It's a proven fact.
I love both of you.
I'm pretty sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
This is irrelevant.
Don't make the same mistake again.
You gotta get more organized.
I think you're funny.
I'm not really angry.
A camel is a horse designed by a committee.
He wouldn't believe us.
Strawberries are made into jam.
I just don't believe you.
I stayed at a nice hotel.
I find you irresistible.
We all cried a lot.

My father is two years younger than my mother.
It used to be that a girl could only marry if she had a dowry.

I'd like to take my jacket off.
Don't read my journal.
My little brother can read English.
Would you tell me the time, please?
He doesn't get jokes.
I think it's time for me to reconsider how I've been living.
Enter the room.
You have no one but yourself to blame.
I've always wanted to learn to cook like you.
She is what one would call a cultured woman.
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
There are lots of things I want to talk about.
Stop where you are.
I had the strangest dream last night.
You have gone too far this time.
My tight wad husband took me to McDonald's for our anniversary.
Do you have dinner plans?
I myself will repair that machine.
These houses were dark and dirty.
You can easily find the bank.
Last night, I heard dogs howling.
I called him to the telephone.
I'm not your son.
Where do you live?
We're glad you're here.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.
None of this is your fault.
Just use mine for now.
That looks like tea.
He pushed me gently.
My homework took longer than I expected.
Excuse me. May I get by?
He has four children to provide for.
We sat in total silence.
He retired to his own room after supper.
Let's take the bus.
It doesn't need to be done right away.
My hobby is playing golf.
We discussed the problem all afternoon.
I think this sweater will look good on you.
I accept, but only under one condition.
Is she interested in me?
It wasn't just luck.
Tom was caught speeding.
We missed you.
Mary is divorced.
What do I have to lose?
She doesn't want him to pick the flowers.
It's freezing in here.
I had my wallet stolen on the bus.
You are my hero.
I feel like I've already seen this movie.
Where did you get on this bus?
I'm waiting for my friend.
This coffee shop is cozy.
You shouldn't judge a person by his looks.
I will show you around the city.
What're you doing?
Both dogs are asleep.
Tom died when he was 97.
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.
Lock the door!
It was the proudest moment of my life.
I'll attend.
We are about to sit down to dinner.
He is breathing hard.
Why can't I hear?
Tom bought three pairs of shoes.
He doesn't lie.
I never want to get married.
I can't do this alone.
I will shoot him.
He is a nice man, except that he talks too much.
There is little money left.
I can't be killed so easily.
I think it's dangerous.
You've never been happy.
I feel like an idiot.
Who's your most interesting friend?
Did we hit something?
That's probably going to fall.
If you touch that wire, you will receive a shock.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
This is a photograph of my home.
Nobody really knows.
I appreciate all your help.
Do you have a problem with what was suggested?
That's a pretty good idea.
Even though he was exhausted, he had to go back to work.
She found him a seat.
I did everything in my power to protect her from you.
He was my student. Now he teaches my children.
Tom wanted to stop and think.
Don't make me kill you.
I enjoyed your company.
He doesn't seem to be aware of the conflict between my father and me.
I had never seen that kind of fish until then.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
She didn't even try to help.
You're smarter than me.
Your hair will grow back.
Did anybody see you?
I trust the room will be to your satisfaction.
I've brought a cup of coffee.
It's not that nice.
Is there anything that I can do for you?
I'd like your permission to use it.
How long are you going to be seeing that loser of a boyfriend?
I had a good night's rest.
Does someone here speak Japanese?
I'd like to get a little shut eye.
The moon is bright.
I don't think it's true.
It is not clear who wrote this letter.
What's the last thing you remember?
Tom never really wanted to go to Harvard.
I still haven't decided yet.
He was shorter than me.
The information you gave me is of little use.
I've gotten used to this climate.
You're the one who trained me.
It is really quite a good story.
I was able to play piano very well.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Tom has been eating at that restaurant since he was a teenager.
The rent is paid for six months.
I don't have any camping equipement.
Can you solve this problem?
All the money was spent on clothes.
He is not very good at mathematics.
A girl with blonde hair came to see you.
We talked about time zones.
Do you know a good restaurant?
They made their way through the crowd.
They have many friends.
My door is always open.
Tom has been very generous.
Kyoto and Boston are sister cities.
We're unrelated.
He likes to talk of love.
Tom is still angry.
No one loves you as much as I do.
I don't really want to be here.
She needs him more than he needs her.
I never wanted to harm you.
I can't let you do that.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
She is handicapped by poor hearing.
I haven't got rid of my bad cold yet.
He doesn't know much about Japan.
Stay calm, and do your best.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
I had him write it.
He told me his life's story.
Write down your name here.
I'm powerless.
She tried to comfort him, but he kept crying.
We need to go.
Let's do something different.
I do not feel sad.
I was on the wrong track.
You are early.
I saw the two together on several occasions.
She doesn't want to talk to me now, and I don't know why.
I thought that you could swim.
I'd like to believe you.
I have some shopping to do.
I think I could get used to this.
Would you lend me your pen?
It's an ambitious plan.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Tom raised his right hand.
We're stuck.
Can you call me a taxi?
I guess you're right about that.
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.
I am looking for my glasses.
You don't have a temperature.
She tried on the party dress.
Don't underestimate us.
She can speak English pretty well.
I prefer it that way.
I've had enough.
This is a book about England.
Did I mess up again?
What I'm about to say is strictly between you and me.
You really are hopeless.
I didn't ask you that.
How many boys are there in your class?
I'm a musician.
What time do you want me to pick you up?
Get out while you can.
I'm going to change my shirt.
Is she all right?
Excuse me, but I can barely hear you.
You never arrive on time.
I'm going to be on TV.
I have been to the U.S. twice.
She refused his proposal.
He isn't afraid to die.
I approve of your plan.
She has no chances of coming in contact with foreigners.
Making cheese is an art.
Always keep your workplace organized.
This patient is suffering from hypoxia.
He can't be under thirty.
He lived a happy life.
These shoes are so tight that I can't put them on.
I had my watch repaired at the store.
It is better to have old second-hand diamonds than none at all.
Traveling is easy these days.
Could you read this for me?
We got separated.
There's no need to hurry.
I didn't want Tom to think I was stupid.
Everyone agreed.

What's your date of birth?
Tom remembered that Mary and John had tried to kill him.

You're a filthy liar!
Stop being cruel.
Bite your tongue.
I just don't want to be reminded of it.

He ignores my problems.
I'm not sure why.
She failed to appear.
Give me the ball.

I liked them before they were popular.
Tom spent most of the morning straightening up his office.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
I know how busy you've been.
She intends to play tennis tomorrow afternoon.
It was very beautiful.
Who are you trying to impress?
If he had stayed at home that day, he would not have met with disaster.
Tom walks faster than Mary.
This kind of cat doesn't have a tail.
How did you know where I'd be?
We have left undone what we ought to have done.
You look familiar.
I'm no saint.
The town has changed a lot since then.
Keep focused on your work.
I watched TV for two hours yesterday.
I danced all night long.

Sometimes I run out of money.
This is a dead-end alley.
Work harder if you plan to succeed.
I'd be honored.
Did I not mention that?
I used to drink a lot of cola, but now I drink only water.
He wants to be more independent.
Where were you on the night of October 20th?
We all got in the car.
I don't wear makeup at all.
Tom didn't say that.
It looks like you did a pretty good job.
I saw the cook.
You're new around here, aren't you?
I like both.
I hope everything will be fine in the end.
You seem distracted today.
I understand your problem.
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
Are you really going to let Tom go there by himself?
She inferred from his silence that he was angry.
We need to know what happened.
She thanked him for his help.
Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful princess.
I want you both to get them.
The man who makes but one mistake a year because he makes but two decisions is wrong fifty per cent of the time.
We'll look into the case at once.
Are you pointing at me?
Let me handle this.
He left soon after our arrival.
She's dependent on her husband.
They're too fat.
The prisoner who escaped two days ago is still at large.
It's raining again!
Is there anybody who can drive a car?
You're not ready yet, are you?
Please be quiet, everybody.
I didn't pull the trigger.
He and I are kindred spirits.
You look positively ghastly.
When I was a child, my mother would often read fairy tales to me.
We've got to take Tom to the doctor.
I love the flowers you sent me.
Find the differences.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
What's with the luggage?
Do you want anything to eat?
We're back.
I'm glad that you understand.
Let's study French.
What time did you close the store last night?
He turned up an hour later.
I'll call you around five o'clock.
You're the oldest.
He apologized profusely.
I'm sorry. I'm partly responsible for it.
That's fantastic news.
There's plenty of water.
I know the reason that she quit her job.
If you follow me, I'll show you the way to the hospital.
I didn't know anyone was there.
Where do you think you're going?
That's all I wanted.
How much is this ball?
She will get well soon.
Let's share the money.
Give them to her.
It'll go away.
Tom won't let Mary do anything she wants to do.
Stay with us.
I have considered that very carefully.
She is old.
Speech is silver, silence is gold.
Are you making fun of me?
The trees were in a row.
Tom stole a lot of money from Mary.
The committee consists of scientists and engineers.
She would often play tricks on me.
Is anybody hurt?
I fixed myself something to eat.
Shouldn't you be studying?
That's what we all thought.
Tom sipped some tea.
The next station is where you get off.
Where did that come from?
Is that a trick question?
Criminals should be punished.
I will speak with you tomorrow.
Tom told Mary not to swim with John.
I just want to help you.
I refuse to be treated like a slave by you.
You should look out for potholes when driving.
It's no use trying to intimidate me.
Keep the kids inside.
He arrived late as usual.
She was alone in the house.
I'll send you the link.
Can you please close the window?
What a wonderful party!
She wrote to him to tell him how wonderful he was.
I had no time to eat.
I'll make some calls.
There are two kinds of work in the world--head work and hand work; mental and manual.
It began to rain cats and dogs.
Does the hat fit well?
There's nothing going on here.
I have to be punished.
Push the door open.
I admit there are a few problems.
Do you have some milk?
I put it on your desk.
Don't forget your bag.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
I can't wait to hear it.
How could you say that?
Tom doesn't want you to get hurt.
They aren't the kind of people you should want to be friends with.
I figured you might change your mind.
You can't believe everything you hear.
Fill the jars with water.
I remember this music.
I did the job in three days.
I don't see how that is any of your business.
I haven't decided yet whether I'll go to college or get a job.
We should ask Tom what he thinks we should do.
Guess what I want to talk about.
It is ten minutes before eleven.
I hate this job sometimes.
We need to focus on our strengths.
Let's not discuss this.
You are drunk!
The button on your coat is coming off.
How many children do you have?
I doubt the new proposal will be accepted.
What are you doing here?
Stop flirting with me.
This is a support group for widows.
We all know it.
The knife isn't sharp.
It wouldn't be the same without you.
I thought Tom didn't drink.
I'd die without you.
You can do anything you want, depending on what floats your boat.
He noticed a hole in his jacket, but he tried to ignore it.
Can you light the way?
The train was delayed because of heavy snowfall.
We're not mad.
He's in hot water.
Stop playing hard to get.
Why are you so angry with me?
Sugar dissolves in water.
She is a bad person.
Where does she live now?
You look Japanese.
She wanted him to say that he loved her.
It seems that the store is closed today.
She acted as a guide.
It started to snow.
I go to any party I am invited to.
Where is my newspaper?
Three people are still missing.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
Traveling abroad is very interesting.
Tom told me to be more careful.
Let's begin on page 30.
I hate sand.
Are you hiring?
They ruined my life.
You're the first person I told that to.
What company do you represent?
He is in charge of entertaining the foreign guests.
Give me a coffee, please.
Who does your decorating?
I'm astonished.
Tom threw an empty beer can at Mary.
Tom deserves much better.
I'd rather stay anonymous.
She selected a blue dress from the wardrobe.
There were 215 votes for the motion and 15 votes against it.
Lincoln set out to abolish slavery in the United States.
They're right behind you.
They don't know what they should do with the money.
He and I are teachers.
Human beings are social creatures.
What do these markings mean?
There is no school today.
Don't leave your things behind.
I often go downtown on Sunday.
Please put your cigarette out.
He picked up the book.
It's unnecessary.
I know her well.
Do you want to tell me what this is?
I'll be OK as long as I stay awake, won't I?
The answer was yes.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I know as little as you do.
Read after me.
What happens next?
I can't feel it.
I really need your help.
I thought it was a fluke.
Tom didn't think he's ever get used to Thai food.
It is warmer today than yesterday.
I am too short.
It happened three hours ago.
I walk across that bridge every morning on the way to school.
Workers at the company went on a strike.
I have no one to say goodbye to.
Let me see that.
I didn't look at Tom.
Tom takes himself too seriously.
I need to study.
I can't win.
I hope you have a good trip.
My work is done.
Whose son are you?
Tom wants to apologize to you.
My grandfather on my mother's side passed away ten years ago.
Do you know his brother?
I can't believe I was so stupid.
If it were not for exams, we would be happy.
Tom rarely wears dark colors.
I never imagined we'd be talking about this topic today.
Will you glance through this report?
I've never done harm to anyone.
Look around you.
He needs you.
Get off my back!
I just don't care enough.
May I accompany you on your walk?
Tom didn't have time to watch TV yesterday.
He's out of practice.
Let's begin our work at once.
Would you like to hear my new song?
Well done, Tom.
He went back to Japan.
This program is a rerun.
Let me in.
What a smart guy!
I dropped my keys.
That young lady is a nurse.
She married a sailor.
He is as tall as his father.
It's a curse.
The night is dark.
I think you'll be able to do it.
Aren't you guys sleepy?
Tom moves quickly.
I know where he lives.
She's a smart girl.
I like French.
I know what to expect.
Tom wanted Mary to tell him about her childhood.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
We've got each other.
I'm almost sure of it.
What time will you get to the station?
I gave my father a silk tie.
I'd like to attend the party.
Tom always checks to verify that no dyes are in any food he buys.
Come on, let's try it.
Lock your doors.
For now, I will wait at the hotel.
Before we go anywhere, we should exchange some money.
They're still not safe.
That doesn't surprise me.
No one knows what to do.
I don't really care what you think.
Never did I expect to see her in such a place.
We've run out of ammunition.
He is a man of noble birth.
Goodnight, Mother.
Winter is cold, but I like it.
You're really a hard worker.
This is an extremely serious matter.
Just do your best.
That'll be seven dollars, please.
It's not the same thing.
I recommend it highly.
Something is wrong with the engine of this car.
Don't worry about what I did.
I want them to be your friends.
Maybe you'd like to come with us.
I just changed my password.
This is most unfortunate.
Have you ever been lonely?
He seemed to like that.
The family seemed to be under a curse.
Tom told me that he doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
We're closed.
Crows all but destroyed the farmer's field of corn.
I love my new job.
I just don't feel like it.
What have you come up with?
I stayed.
You're clever.
Can you tell us about your experience in developing technical materials?
He laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair.
You're the oldest.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
I hit on a good idea.
I want you out of my room.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
Did Tom break your heart?
If I told you, you wouldn't understand.
Where do you usually eat lunch?
You're in grave danger.
He left Japan at the end of the year.
It goes without saying that money is not everything.
It is better to be a coward for five minutes than dead for the rest of your life.
I hate to wait.
Which is your pen?
There is an orange on the table.
He often gets angry at small things.
There must be something in there.
How do you plan to get home?
I have to do it myself.
What's the difference between asteroids and comets?
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
I remember seeing him.
I don't even like you.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
He risked losing all his fortune.
Don't forget us.
This dog is shaggy.
I'm not saying this to hurt you, but it's the truth.
The crew were all waiting for the news.
The English Channel separates England and France.
Have a nice trip!
This is yours.
He is my brother, not my father.
Any book will do as long as it is interesting.
I think this is yours.
I want you to be prepared.
Let's give it a try.
Had they known what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I glanced through the brochure.
I can't help making fun of him.
Can you drive a car?
Look out!
He joined the English club.
All of a sudden, the fire alarm went off.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
Someone was calling my name.
There is no accounting for tastes.
Do you like her songs?
She is his real mother.
I felt like I was intruding.
I handled it.
Can you slow down a little?
That's the important thing to remember.
I've got a sweet tooth.
We kept the children quiet.
What you were taught is wrong.
I've got to speak to you.
Why don't you sing?
I remember when it happened.
We did not get your letter until yesterday.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
You don't need to do that.
I'll lend you the money, but mind you, this is the last time.
Finding a good place to live isn't easy.
You can rely on his proven ability.
I've heard this story before.
He was slightly injured in a traffic accident.
That's not always the case.
I worked on a farm.
Were you going to the train station when I saw you?
I think you should get started.
That's why I'm here.
I saw Tom sitting in the third row.
Is this place safe?
The man did not so much as apologize for stepping on my foot.
My parents hardly ever punished me for anything.
I have to withdraw some cash from the bank.
By the way, what happened to the money I lent you?
You like olives, don't you?
That would be interesting.
I want those kids to leave.
Where did you get all this from?
I'm moving, so I need boxes for my belongings.
It's settled then.
Don't cross the road while the signal is red.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but I am truly mesmerized by your beauty.
My baby has a hereditary disease.
I was humiliated.
I want to eat steak.
It's my book.
How much do you want to spend?
It's only money.
I feel well.
It's no use pretending that you can't speak French.
I'm not going to compete.
Tom knew the truth, but he didn't let anyone know that he knew it.
I've missed another chance.
I can't stand this stomachache.
Language is the means by which people communicate with others.
You can't hurt my feelings.
They're self sufficient.
I made a mess of that.
My life is complete.
I'll study your report.
Do you think I'm qualified for that job?
I need to find out who he was.
Could you stay and help me?
I didn't know you were that good at French.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
I wish I could sing as well as Tom.
I'm no longer tired.
I wish that were the case.
What teams were playing?
Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you.
Please call me at my hotel later.
Did you have any trouble?
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
He wrote a letter.
Is anyone else bidding?
I was very busy today.
Do you know where the bathroom is?
I heard that.
Tom armed himself with a gun and a knife.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
George Washington was born in 1732.
She allegedly killed him.
I did what I was asked.
There's a catch.
The concert hasn't started yet.
I know I've told you this before.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
You were perfect.
I drink beer.
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
I told Tom I loved him.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
My father loves pizza.
Tom is going to cross the river.
Bring him in.
Has anyone ever told you you've got serious trust issues?
How about going for a walk after lunch?
They live downstairs.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Don't you see what's going on?
I think it's time for me to come clean.
Don't try to blame this all on me.
What are those?
I don't know much about that.
This diagram will illustrate what I mean.
What time do you leave for school?
Tom comforted Mary.
We just want you to tell the truth.
What do you say to going swimming tomorrow?
Can you help me find it?
Can you explain how this machine works?
I'm not a psychic.
What was it that brought you to me?
No one followed me.
I outrank you.
Let's keep this matter between ourselves.
Do you want me to bring you something to eat?
I can't go on with this.
Are you falling in love with me?
I should be there.
Having finished the work, he went to bed.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
Can you tell me how to get to the train station?
Tom is worried sick about Mary.
I have something for you to do.
That is where you are wrong.
I'm making progress.
Everybody in the room let out a sigh of relief.
Have you been seeing a lot of him recently?
I see a pattern.
A sprain like this should heal within a week or so.
I don't regret a thing.
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
I'll ride shotgun.
I'm not dead yet.
What did you do this time?
I met him on my way home.
I just want to rest.
We rested on some stones.
He delayed answering the letter.
Tom and Mary both ordered the lunch special.
Can anyone drive?
I wish you hadn't found me.
He needs to be the center of attention.
I made cookies.
I hate this job.
How soon are you going shopping?
Be kind to old people.
Keep the door locked.
I wish you were here with me now.
You have to do this whether you like it or not.
It's hard to learn a foreign language.
Their modest income doesn't allow for many luxuries.
I'm a pretty good student.
Tom hasn't called me.
Here is the house where he lived.
She entered this school last year.
Who wants you to be the boss?
I appreciate the support.
He is a teacher of English.
He plays the piano very well.
We've run out of ammunition.
When were you thinking of coming back to the States?
If you're not happy, quit.
I'm so proud of you.
What position do you hold?
I was not sure what to do.
In case anything happens, call me immediately.
We'll manage.
What is the price of this watch?
I had an inspiration.
No one opposed the choice.
I don't think it'll be easy.
No one can match him in English.
I had to make a decision.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
"Will you have another cup of coffee?" "No, thank you."
Anybody want a beer?
I don't know why he was late.
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
Tom needs a change of scenery.
It's a lovely day.
I abhor violence.
I'm trying to save money.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
I saw you snickering.
I was too stunned to talk.
Are you ready to go?
He acts quickly.
Some prominent tennis players behave like spoiled brats.
Thanks for stopping by.
Who's to say it's not what's supposed to happen?
He is absorbed in his work.
He likes being surrounded by young people.
Wait for your turn, please.
Tom never talks to Mary.
It's for my personal use.
I figured I might find you here.
He is playing in his room.
He is at home today.
We volunteered.
I'm a non-native speaker of English and realize there is a lot that I still need to learn.
Thank you for your advice.
My mother lives by herself.
The car broke down on the way to the airport.
I'm sure that you'll succeed.
He always wears his school tie.
I didn't tell anyone what time I'd be arriving.
You may go there.
All the hostages were released unharmed.
She kept working.
She weighs 120 pounds.
There were a lot of men among the inhabitants.
He squashed the insect with the heel of his foot.
I didn't even notice you.
This door leads to the study.
We are facing a violent crisis.
I am just going for a walk.
Whereabouts did you say this happened?
I cannot understand what you say.
He got lost while walking in the woods.
What was the time of death?
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
It's not evening yet.
This is the book I want to buy.
Do you really think it's no good?
He was small, but strong.
They stayed at a five-star hotel.
We all care for one another.
The house is said to be haunted.
Let's watch something else.
It's freezing outside.
Where did you see that woman?
I feel safer here.
I could've met you at the airport.
I liked your friends.
Are you happy?
I don't believe that.
He must be stupid to believe such a thing.
There was no response.
He watched after the children as they were swimming.
His car is two years old.
I am thinking of closing my savings account.
I care about all of you.
These are animals.
Tom certainly goes to bed early.
What do you think is down there?
You're not the only one that was hurt.
Was there a lot of traffic?
I don't want you to make the same mistake I made.
No one speaks this language anymore.
Leave your umbrella in the hall.
I don't care where you're eating dinner.
He has half as many books as I do.
There are many islands in Greece.
Give me just a little.
This plan has no flaws.
I owe him 50,000 yen.
Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
What might that be?
These shoes are too big for me.
I want to get out of here.
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
It's all I want.
The sun sank slowly below the horizon.
Fill in this application form and send it at once.
He finally found out how to make it.
We ate until we couldn't eat any more.
I'm going to deal with the problem in this chapter.
Please show me another one.
Let's send Tom a sympathy card.
Laughter filled the room.
Which are the best ones?
Why did you marry him?
It's a bunch of nonsense.
Oranges grow in warm countries.
What am I up against?
If Cleopatra's nose had been shorter, the history of the world would be different.
She got no answer from him.
He declined the offer and so did I.
She said she would be back soon.
Who won?
I grind my own coffee beans every morning.
He's got a headache.
I don't like being surprised.
She was perfect.
Whoever comes will be welcomed.
Do what you like.
My mom works in a factory.
She feeds her dog the same thing that she eats.
You're the only one who can help me.
Tom doesn't have a cat.
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party.
That's not so important.
You can't learn a foreign language in just a couple of weeks.
He is a student.
The boy caught a large fish.
She speaks Spanish well.
I must do something.
I could smell the alcohol on his breath.
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
He has a beard.
Armenian is an Indo-European language.
This dictionary is not useful at all.
My parents know about it.
I'm tired of eating fast food.
Did I miss something?
Will there be any food at the party?
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
Can you help me a little?
You're out of time.
A sneeze leaves your body at forty miles an hour.
Don't drink out of my glass.
She must be sick.
She had gone to bed.
Let's eat in the park like we used to.
He is tall and lean.
Please pardon me for coming late.
Get out of my seat.
I hate fanatics.
I got up at 4:00, ate some food, then went back to sleep.
This is by far the tallest building in this city.
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
I don't think I could live without you.
That's the eject button. Don't touch it.
Don't call me a jerk.
I didn't realize you were awake.
How do you plan to make amends?
I found the earring that you lost.
She did her best to help him.
Be merciful.
Don't forget about me.
I have fewer books than you.
She altered her plans.
Can you hear us?
He didn't turn up after all.
That's all I said.
Americans are frank enough to say what they think.
I'm not sad.
She answered my letter right away.
I will never forgive you.
We can't stay here.
I'm sure I can find something for you to wear.
How come you didn't come to the party?
We've had a lot of rain this year.
We saw it on the news.
He swallowed detergent by mistake.
I must fix it.
I must discuss that new plan with him.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Will you be going?
Do I really look so sad?
I don't know why he quit the company.
Tom is going to try again.
Don't cheat him.
My father might be at home now.
Don't bother getting up.
Assuming your story is true, what should I do?
He was sharpening a knife.
I had to get something out of the car.
I never go anywhere.
I have another idea.
I can barely pay my rent.
I have another engagement.
I was moved to tears by the story.
Gesture is another way of communication.
Several houses were carried away by the great flood.
He took me for everything I had.
I met him quite unexpectedly.
I often think of my dead mother.
She was asked to convince him to get his son to paint the house.
They collected shells on the beach.
I can't imagine such a life.
Can you imagine what life would be like without television?
After a while passion and infatuation ooze away.
I'm going to Australia.
You have such beautiful eyes.
Why don't you start by telling us where you went?
Give me a table for two near the window.
Let us agree to disagree.
Tom wishes for his son to inherit his estate.
I am forever in your debt.
That child wants some friends to play with.
I have an identical twin.
They slept in the same room.
I'm a French citizen.
If you keep on drinking like that, you'll be drunk very soon.
How would you describe me?
I want a piece of chocolate cake.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I have to get dressed now.
I said that I could, not that I would.
The players on this team are all giants.
You're so bossy.
Stop right here.
First of all, you should talk it over with your parents.
I woke you up.
What if something went wrong?
Do you want to go for a walk later?
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
You feel lonesome, don't you?
I just couldn't go through with it.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
The engine doesn't work.
I've always had a sweet tooth.
You were terrified, weren't you?
I don't want to force you to go.
I don't care what people say.
No one will care.
They have a problem.
He's very likely to come.
That's not the point.
I haven't told the kids yet that we're getting divorced.
I am eating an apple.
I feel like I've become someone else.
I'm happy enough.
You're cool.
Once a month, I go to the hairdresser.
You can't miss it.
I was kind of surprised to see Tom there.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
How old is the oldest person you know?
It's not funny.
He gave a detailed description of the accident.
Many children at this school are malnourished.
Tom fell asleep while reading.
We need to be more aggressive.
I can give it a shot.
I did nothing.
You are dreaming.
What do you think about this outfit?
You've got a cute friend.
You're very resourceful.
Do you know his brother?
Which is your favorite team?
Einstein loved playing the violin.
Did you see it?
She's a looker.
He liked that.
I have some gifts.
Can I borrow your computer?
He hasn't appeared yet.
The castle is across the river.
Be careful not to drive on the wrong side of the road.
I said I liked it.
How did they find out?
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
A few years ago, there was a huge scandal at my school.
You still haven't told me why you're here.
There are a lot of beautiful roses in our garden.
I worked as hard as I could so I didn't fail.
I think you should think about the future.
Am I wrong?
A cop was killed.
He asked me to do it.
He kept staring at me.
I think it's time for me to abandon that idea.
You're not the only one with this problem.
It was all over.
You can swim, but I can't.
It could have been worse.
The regulation was abolished, but then it was reenacted.
They found each other.
Tom wanted Mary to stay with him forever.
I'm giving you what you want.
I thought about giving my saxophone to Tom as a gift.
You've put on weight, haven't you?
I figured that would make you laugh.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
It'll only take three minutes.
How do you know that you don't need a bodyguard?
Let's hit the showers.
Are you ready?
I didn't know how to do it, but I was willing to give it a try.
You're tough.
He won a gold medal.
Go back to the lab.
I don't have change.
May I come again?
I don't have to tell you anything.
I'll prove it.
What is there to be afraid of?
Our school has about one thousand students.
I have to learn many words and phrases by heart.
I know how to ski.
Something bad's going to happen.
Security was increased in the city.
Tom probably can't do that as well as I can.
I got you all right where I want you.
The man was a fountain of knowledge.
Come here and sit down.
That's not quite what I wanted.
Of course!
Don't open that door for anybody.
My friend likes to live in the city, but his wife prefers to live in their little cottage in the country.
This is the largest temple that I have ever seen.
They're clean.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
I'm having fun.
You did that on your own, didn't you?
He believed in the truth.
Tie your shoes.
I thought you'd changed.
Kennedy Airport, please.
When I was a child, I was always drinking milk.
I made a list.
Pungent fumes arose from the chemical mixture.

All I think about is you.
The prisoners tried to escape.
He is smelling the soup.
You can rely on him.
You should not go alone.
Be sure to turn off the light when you leave the room.
I can't hear you very well.
He has since taken to drinking at lunch.
They said it's OK.
You won't believe it.
I'm not good enough for you.
Would you mind going over that again?
Tom went out for a breath of fresh air.
They hired someone else for the job.
I thought this was mine.
Why are you all dressed up?
Who gave you this?
I'll show you around the town.
I thought it was a good idea.
I still love you.
I left.
Don't make me go back there.
I'll put you out of your misery.
I've got to get back home by midnight.
I lost my inspiration.
We were there for a long time.
What are you doing up?
He went aboard the plane.
He seems to be honest.
Am I the only one that sees the humor in this?
French isn't an easy language.
You're a little liar.
Our love will last forever.
The lights aren't on.
She is able to sing very well.
The accused told the judge that he was innocent.
Prices have jumped.
I really appreciate you picking me up.
Be nicer to your sister.
This is child's play.
It was a bad idea.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Lost in thought, I missed my stop.
Today is a national holiday.
You're very timid.
I don't know if I should stay or run.
It's high time you got going.
Everyone was doing it.
Have a seat.
Tom waited his turn.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
It looks like we're all here.
That was months ago.
This is not going to end well.
Tell Tom he has to do everything Mary asks him to do.
This is the guide who took us around the castle.
We're not young.
I saw the car hit a man.
I made my decision.
They had been thinking about it for some time.

I'm sorry you're leaving us.
I totally believe you.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
Give me a kiss.
I was just wondering how you guys ever got talking about this topic.
When it was stretched, the material tore.
He catches colds very easily.
Something seems to be wrong with my clock.
Maybe what you said is true.
They despise you.
Don't stay here.
He fell asleep immediately.
I handled it.
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
We are looking for each other.
It belongs to me.
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.
We can't help Tom now.
Why don't you run for student council?
I've got my guitar in the trunk of my car.
Automobiles replaced carriages.
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
I want you to beg for mercy.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
Now means now.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
I opened the window.
Tom and I are buddies.
She's loved by her friends.
His story was published in a magazine.
The party was a success.
He was already regretting it.
I'm no quitter.
Have you betrayed me?
A dog was run over by a truck.
I don't have to go to the doctor any more. I'm feeling much better.
I wish I had listened to your warnings.
Tom disappeared last month.
I'm done watering the flowers.
You should try to form the habit of using your dictionaries.
He knows what's going on.
I'm getting the hang of this new machine.
It was Tom who helped us find Mary.
Don't hesitate to ask a question if you don't understand.
I know why you're here.
You're preaching to the choir.
They made the right choice.
I hope she will get well.
Can you help her out before they catch her?
It seemed like you weren't interested.
Education is one of the most essential aspects of life.
I don't remember doing that.
This is crazy.
I don't know what you're complaining about.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
The phone rang for a long time.
The last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat vegetables.
Have some ham.
I wish I were taller.
I don't understand that question.
I figured I'd be safe here.
Will you shut up?
I finished first.
The dictionary is of great use to me.
Why do you wear a watch?
He also saw it.
I doubt there's anyone following me.
I met my friends yesterday.
We were partners.
Even though computer programmers may use semicolons every day, nowadays most people only use semicolons for emoticons.
Half of them are students.
They swam.
I usually wake up at six.
I think you should leave Tom alone.
Tom doesn't need to worry about Mary.
It's kind of hard.
I thought it might be nice for us to spend some time together.
Everyone knows that.
Is her story true?
Tom is my friend.
My computer won't start up anymore.
My approach is different.
Can you go faster?
He is not stupid.
It's sweet.
I'm not going to get involved.
My strength is all gone.
Snap out of it!
You will be all right again in a couple of days.
They have families.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
Can you give us your point of view?
He is equal to the job.
I need it today.
Can you believe this is really happening?
I wish you could have come with me.
I get a three percent commission on anything I sell.
No one will miss me.
I'm the one who met him.
We bought a pound of tea.
You don't seem too worried.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
I'd never dream of it.
Don't you read the tabloids?
Put yourself in my place.
Radio is a great invention.
We have no reason to change our plans.
That was really intense.
The boy enjoyed painting a picture.
I cannot whistle.
Never forget to lock the door.
This is the real world.
I hate rainy days.
This is a very small book.
I shouldn't have used the word "password" as my password.
It will be entertaining, if nothing else.
She said that she had been happy.
Tom isn't listed in the phone book.
Why are you standing there?
Banks open at nine o'clock.
I can't do it right away.
Are you a natural blonde?
Don't leave your work half finished.
Are you children all right?
Ask Tom to explain it.
She knew better than to argue with him.
After the rain, there were puddles on the street.
I strolled along the streets to kill time.
Take no prisoners.
I spent three hours repairing the car.
Where's a mirror?
Few people understood his comment.
Please speak more slowly.
Let me remind you of something.
The sky is blue.
I love books.
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
Tom tried to do it, but he couldn't.
She has her arm in a cast.
I have some problems to take care of.
The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv.
I'd like some time alone, please.
He achieved his aim at last.
He cried with joy.
You forgot your coat.
You can see how much difference a few degrees can make.
Did anyone care?
I think there's only a slim chance of that happening.
This is a real popular item.
What year were you born?
She went to the train station to see him off.
I have to charge the battery of my car.
I think that Tom and only Tom can do it. However, some people think that Mary could do it, too.
This is yours.
Tom lives next door to us.
I'm not proud of that.
Can you play the violin?
It's almost time.
I don't think I can do it.
Can they see us?
It smells like bleach.
My plan is different from yours.

He can't chew well, because he has a toothache now.
Sometimes, pictures can fool people.
He is in front of the door.
You think you're funny?
Is that thing working?
What do you have in your hand?
That happens sometimes.
No one can help you.
How do you know each other?
Tom blamed Mary for the project's failure.
Take a wild guess.
Hurry up, and you'll catch the train.
I already know what I wanted to know.
I feel quite at ease among strangers.
Did you know this at the time?
Don't obey that man.
That's what I want most right now.
He calculated the speed of light.
Do you mind if I leave for a few minutes?
That's the best thing that could happen to me.
The concert is about to start.
You didn't buy that, did you?
I have two dogs. One is white and the other black.
How about wearing contact lenses?
This is a book of children's stories.
It wasn't me.
She gave him the brush off.
This is where my father works.
A dog followed me to my house.
You should have been more careful.
Get out of here.
You'll never guess what happened to me today.
It has been just a week since I arrived in New York.
It's morning here in my time zone.
Which one will you choose?
I didn't want you to get involved.
He often appears on TV.
It's a sign of the times.
I got first place.
Could you gift wrap it?

Do you also want a shave?
Why are you so insecure?
Keep your room as neat as you can.
Be a man.
Our team did very well.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
I will not attend the party.
It could be a trap.
Why didn't you phone before coming?
I think we're getting close.
She is not ashamed of her misconduct.
I've seen this before.
I love the way you walk.
I have difficulty concentrating.
We're going to do everything we can.
I'll do my very best not to disappoint you.
Tom told me that he was sorry.
All the students passed the test.
Meeting girls is hard.
You've been cleared of all charges.
I have everything.
He's going to get fired.
Don't you think that Tom was a little weird?
I'm rarely this angry.
We really need to win.
Anyone can do it.
She sang the song with tears running down her cheeks.
It's my fault, not yours.

Give me an example.

Can I borrow an umbrella?
It matters to me.
You're not fired.
Don't read my diary.
I thought hard.
She is good at skiing.
I acted like I didn't know her.
Let me give you a lift as far as the station.
I don't like your friends.
I work different hours every day.
Who's taking responsibility for this?
You're not welcome here.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
I know how this looks to you.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
We've lost three games in a row.
What do you think the audience wants?
I don't like this type of house.

He attaches importance to this matter.
He kindly answered the question.
That's why we want you.
You can't count on Tom's help.
What did I miss?
She helped him tie his tie because he didn't know how to.
Everyone gasps.
This will do for the time being.
Tom is here to protect me.
You'll never leave this town.
If you came, that would be great.
He pretended to be my friend.
I want to make this quick.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
That would be a good start.
Nothing's working.
Perhaps there are other reasons.
Was Tom in Boston yesterday?
I cannot help feeling that the attempt has turned out to be a failure.

He does well in physics.
I had my bicycle stolen.
Everything was going great.
That sounds very tempting.
I told you so.
We're experienced.
I'd like to sit further back.
Did I ask for your help?
I've never been to a professional baseball game.
It's not real money.
I had difficulty getting a ticket for the concert.
He likes money.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you to do.
I don't know anybody in Boston.
For the moment there's nothing in particular I need to be doing.
It's very unlikely that a serious art collector would ever buy anything from that source.
We look forward to getting back home.
I don't know why you need it.
That's very possible.
How many teams are there?
I know what they're paying you.
Tom has been spreading rumors about Mary.
I can't believe your mom made you wear that.
I can't believe I showed you that.
We don't even know if it's true.
They fell into each other's arms.
My mom likes my brother more than me.
How long have you been busy?
I can't pay the rent.
Tom doesn't blame you for anything.
A blind person's hearing is often very acute.
I'm dying to see you.
Do you know who that tall blonde girl in green is?
Who listens to Tom?
I wonder why women don't go bald.
Tom says that he never dreams.
You have a very logical way of thinking.
I never saw him again.
Buffalo bones were made into tools.
Tom looks interested.
Get out of here now!
I did what I had to do.
Click here to create an account.
Who's your favorite actor?
I want you back.
I thought about all the times we used to play together as kids.
Have you ever been married?
Her skin is perfectly smooth.
When I saw her recently, she looked very happy.
What did you do last Sunday?
Greater demand for high-quality coffee has helped drive coffee prices higher.
Tom and Mary have recently moved to Boston.
It is next to impossible.
That's alright.
Was that not clear?
At the next intersection, take a right.
Do you like fish?
I panicked and ran.
You must prepare yourself for the worst.
Our whole case hinges on whether the government's actions were constitutional or not.
People do that all the time.
I'm not staying here.
If you hadn't done it, someone else would have.
I never care about such things.
You're really awesome.
He quit.
It can be fatal.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
What could they possibly want from us?
Please remember to wake me up at seven tomorrow morning.
Don't push it.
I met an old man who says that he's never eaten at a restaurant in his whole life.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
It was rather funny.
Tom was extremely impolite.
You'll be the first to know.
We haven't been around that long.
I support you one hundred percent.
That sounds too good to be true.
I have something that might interest you.
I'm sorry that I didn't email you sooner.
You're weak.
I just have one question for you.
Let me give you a lift as far as the station.
Tom bends over backwards to please Mary.
I thought you might like to know where we'll be going next weekend.
How do you like them apples?
You're cuter than Mary.
I didn't think you needed one.
He dropped it.
I put it in your room.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
I thought you already had one.
I hope we'll see each other again sometime.
My boss praised me for my hard work.
Two families live in the same house.
Forget it!
I'm healthy.
He doesn't drink coffee.
How much are these shoes?
I am against working on Sundays.
I love American movies.
Tom doesn't want to stop.
We're done.
He told me that he would start the next day.
I am single.
I'll afraid this kind of meeting isn't getting us anywhere.
She looked at the picture.
Above all, I want to be healthy.
I was unable to stand any longer.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
The cat is sitting on top of the table.
He who hesitates is lost.
I cooked dinner.
I was disgusted.
I'm a lot more comfortable now.
I completely approve of this.
Comb your hair before you go out.
They did it in front of the staff.
I wonder how much time we've wasted so far.
I arrived too late and missed the train.
If I had had more time, I would have written to you.
They attempted to assassinate the president.
What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
Were you disrespectful?
I met his sister last week.
They'll never know we're here.
Don't tell anyone.
I don't know his whereabouts.
Hurry up.
You must read the textbook closely.
How do parents do it?
We were surprised by his behavior.
Would you mind if I ate a piece of this pie?
He showed courage in the face of great danger.
Please give me a piece of paper to write on.
Come over to our table.
Tom had a smile on his face.
Everyone knows the law.
Tom will never know it was you who told me.
You were all a big help.
I have lost my camera.
At what time does your class end?
Are you for or against this?
It feels silly.
Tom had a rough day.
Take this medicine after each meal.
How many siblings do you have?
I am Japanese.
I'd like to buy a new car.
Additional imports of American beef are planned to meet rising demand.
He's eating lunch now.
My teacher warned me not to do it again.
Raise your hands.
I never saw him in jeans.
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
He is a detective.
Tom hanged himself in his jail cell.
We're almost there.
How do you make your money?
I folded my shirts and put them in my suitcase.
I can't believe you let this happen.
I think it's time for me to get my own place.
I had to change the rules.
You never told me you were married.
I didn't see you.
I want to make one thing clear.
The old man died last week.
Don't scribble here.
How long is the flight?
He added that he didn't believe it.
I went for a drive in the country.
You should have stopped.
I'm on vacation.
You won't need it.
I don't understand this obsession of yours.
Would you buy that?
I want to get married and have children.
I have no home to return to.
Can I get you anything else?
If you spend too much time in the sun without putting on sunscreen, you are likely to get a sunburn.
Are you still upset about what happened?
He can be relied on.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for your health.
Don't be afraid to get your feet wet.
The two cars collided at the intersection.
Where are the toilets?
It's considered to be an important matter.
Somehow or other I found his house.
Everyone knows what they have to do, right?
It was just a fling.
I need a pencil. Can I use one of yours?
Somebody is watching me.
I received a letter written in English.
Are you home?
Why don't you grow up?
I brought reinforcements.
Mary is being careful with her baby.
How come you didn't call me last night?
Good luck on the test!
We live close to the station.
Perhaps he will come.
I read five different magazines each month.
Who died?
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
He is working hard to pass the examination.
Instant noodles are a staple among college students.
I think you did very well.
My backyard can hold more than ten people.
I don't even know where.
Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.
I don't need you to wait for me.
Teaching young children isn't easy.
That's just fine with me.
You could've ruined everything.
There's no elevator.
This is perfect.
"Have you eaten?" "Yes, I have."
I thought it best to remain silent.
We don't have to talk about this now.
You need to be here for your family.
That's all I'm thinking about.
Are you quite certain about it?
Tom forgot his umbrella in his car.
I love you for who you are.
The boy didn't change his opinion.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
Ask him where he parked his car.
Water the flowers before you eat breakfast.
We're here early.
He has left already.
That's wise.
Can you help me?
I think you would like it here.
I don't remember anything else.
Did you get the check?
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
He fainted in the middle of his speech.
I don't make as much money as I'd like to.
He has the habit of standing up when he is angry.
I can't carry this suitcase. It's too heavy.
Let me paint you a picture.
People are not always what they seem.
I fall asleep easily while watching television.
I'll take it into consideration.
I didn't get any of that.
Look at the picture on the wall.
Will you be much longer?
I met a friend there.
He removed his sunglasses.
I wonder if anybody knows how to do this.
Aren't they Englishmen?
Hey, what's up?
Is everything prepared?
Give me your word that you won't do that.
He must be a fool to talk like that.
You were happy.
Tom told Mary he was busy.
To me, it is important.
I agree with everyone.
You don't give orders here.
He stood by himself.
If you are hungry, why don't you eat?
Tom told Mary to shut up.
Thank you for stopping by.
Years of running in marathons have taken a toll on my knees.
I don't want to go with you.
I remember seeing you before.
I have standards.
We don't have a lot of trouble.
The audience was deeply affected.
I will go if you go.
Tom's wounded.
I'm not embarrassed.
You are a beautiful butterfly.
She has her faults, but I like her.
He passed the examination.
You're unfair.
He was sitting and reading a book.
I don't think they heard us.
You don't sound very optimistic.
The nurse attended the patient.
Where did you go to school?
I like being with you.
It's a wonder they're still awake.
She's not at home now.
I had a speech ready.
Would you like to drink anything?
He meets his girlfriend Saturdays.
She arranged the flowers beautifully.
I don't know what we're going to find, but we should find something.
Women eat lighter meals when they're eating with a guy.
I love tea.
We have nothing against it.
Tom didn't want to go back to where he was born.
The price of rice rose by more than three percent.
When is the ship due to arrive?
I've worked very hard.
Which one is more expensive?
Did you understand any of that?
I have to say goodbye to a few people.
They all killed themselves.
You're so mean.
Nowadays, traveling costs a lot of money.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in.
Would you like me to go there with you?
When we saw what was happening there, we decided to leave.
I'm still thirsty.
That's crazy.
Tom could've changed.
Do you like going to school?
I'm smarter than you.
No words can relieve her deep sorrow.
No one died.
His house is somewhere around here.
How are your parents?
I am sure.
I have a red car.
He remains sick in bed.
She remained single all her life.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
I don't want to be alone with Tom.
That was a nice speech.
The kid is a pain in the neck.
Here is your bag.
I'm so drunk that I can't feel my face anymore.
Don't pull my sleeve.
Are you good at speaking French?
Tom acted the part of a sailor.
That kind of machine is yet to be invented.
If you had stuck around, you'd have met the girl I've been seeing.
Let's ask.
You're silly.
I like that one better.
What did Tom say about me?
She wanted him to sing her a song.
We all did well.
This is no time to be funny.
Please visit us at your convenience.
I'm really embarrassed.
Looters stole ancient artifacts from the tomb.
I love your daughter.
There's something wrong with my computer.
I'll show you that you're wrong.
I believe that there's a mistake.
Please don't think of it that way.
Let's take a break for coffee.
Every little boy needs a hero.
Who are you talking about?
In other words, she's dumb.
You're the teacher.
I run five miles a day.
The police are investigating the cause of the crash.
I'd like to live in that house.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
The farmer caught the boy stealing the apples in his orchard.
Are they still in bed?
He was drunk on beer.
He is earning twice my salary.
We picked apples so we could make an apple pie.
I think that's the right thing to do.
Tom's death was preventable.
What was the outcome?
Air is a mixture of gases that we cannot see.
Have you heard that a burglar broke into my neighbor's house?
Never mix business with pleasure.
He was given up for dead.
I don't know which of you came first.
They were peaceful.
I have to talk to you alone.
Is something happening?
You never told me that.
Tom copies everything I do.
If only I'd been a little taller!
We do all kinds of repairs.
I'm not very good at it.
The tsunami alert was cancelled.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
Don't stand near me.
A passport is usually necessary when you travel overseas.
You must be in love.
We're going to the movies.
He thinks he can prove it.
I have no time tomorrow.
I admire Tom's dedication.
He ignored me.
Tom teaches us French.
Why do you study?
How long has it been since you received a letter from him?
I don't see that it matters now.
Tom is getting bored.
You can come along if you want.
Here, everybody feels respected and appreciated.
Everyone's asleep.
The people I work with are all very kind.
Where will your party be?
Stay in bed.
I can't breathe through my nose.
We ordered some new books from abroad.
I go up to the rooftop when I want to see the blue sky.
They advertised that they had a house for sale.
I have seen that girl before.
This price is reasonable.
No one uses that word anymore.
I own some very old stamps.
She didn't exactly agree with me.
I'd like to be your friend.
This is my first time.
I don't believe that anymore.
He died on the day his son arrived.
He proofread my manuscript.
I would tend to agree with that.
I can't bring myself to do such a thing.
We're all thinking the same thing, I'm sure.
It's really cool here.
Can I tempt you to try another piece of cake?
It is warm there all the year round.
He doubts that I'll keep my promise.
I'm sorry to say, but the service isn't very good.
Please don't hurt me.
You said you didn't understand.
Bring a lunch.
He'll never achieve anything unless he works harder.
These are just routine questions we ask everyone.
I strongly urge you to follow my advice.
Yesterday was my seventeenth birthday.
Why did you accept this assignment?
I have something to talk over with you.
It's okay to take it easy sometimes.
I've received it too.
You are his brother, right?
I'd like to come along.
Tell me more.
Tom didn't know where Mary had gone skiing.
My son wants to be a professional golfer.
Do you know how fast you were going?
I'll tell you what you want to know.
One of my friends knows you.
Variable names in C are case sensitive.
It's transparent.
We really can make this happen.
More research is needed.
We will be living in England.
She filled the vase with water.
Tom and Mary are very hungry.
I can see it in your eyes.
I'm disgusted.
We'll have to do this quickly.
I go to school on foot.
Let me repair it.
I'm not English.
I'm sorry I didn't make it to your party.
How will you pay your debts?
It's yours if you want it.
Be careful.
I like things the way they are.
You're free of all responsibility.
I wanted to see you, too.
You won't go, will you?
This is what you're supposed to do.
Please move this stone from here to there.
This is the end of the world as we know it.
I feel vulnerable.
I want something sweet.
It was very hard for her to suppress her emotions.
Won't you come with me?
I will go if you come.
So, do you really want to do this?
Stay down.
Tom watched TV yesterday.
All things considered, he is a good teacher.
Tom can't play a high G on his trumpet, but he can play an F.
It's cold there even in the summer.
Looking at your Facebook friends' photos is a waste of time.
This camera is very expensive.
I think it's time for me to leave now.
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
He turned his attention to the picture.
He was underwater for three minutes.
I could not afford to buy a bicycle.
The general ordered the deployment of two battalions.
She has been blind from birth.
Don't forget to turn off the gas before you leave the house.
She's terrified of talking to strangers.
The children shared a pizza after school.
A lot of jobs are done by computers.
Tom's face feels rough because he needs to shave.
Please move the desk to the left.
I really appreciate your coming.
They're dead.
Can I talk to you a sec?
Did Tom ask you to do it?
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
Being an only child, he was the sole heir.
This isn't what I asked for.
She is first in line.
He is content with the simple life.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I just emailed you.
It was truly a miracle.
Leave him alone.
I'm introverted.
You are tired, aren't you?
I'd be happy to help you.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Do you want this done quickly or do you want this done right?
You shouldn't laugh at his mistakes.
The camera you bought is better than mine.
He was covered all over with paint.
I don't know what happened.
It's dirt cheap.
Life goes on.
He will make a good team captain.
Sometimes things that happen do not make sense.
I'm dying of thirst.
They're back where they want to be.
He works under me.
Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't want him at her party.
Have you ever had any serious illness?
I used to be a teacher here.
What is the local time in New York?
We've only got three more days.
You must be cautious.
Didn't I mention that?
I made my dog lie down.
Let me help you put on your coat.
How is the weather?
I hate parties.
He asked her if she knew him.
Our bike tour of the French Alps lasted two weeks.
And now a word from our sponsor.
Family is important.
No one loves war.
She took advantage of our hospitality and stayed a whole month without paying us anything.
We expect rain today.
You're cruel.
She was asked to convince him to paint the house.
Tom is as tall as Mary.
I want to go into town.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
Can Tom come tomorrow?
She burned with jealousy.
You don't have the guts.
My father played golf on the Sunday morning.
My father caught three fish yesterday.
This movie is frightening to the children.
I saw a cottage in the distance.
She takes care of many elderly people.
I hated you at first.
What would've happened if Tom had come?
I don't pretend to understand global warming.
He never told anyone.
You've run out of things to drink.
Tom isn't crying.
They were afraid of you.
Did he show you the picture?
I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.
There is a museum just north of the zoo.
This is the biggest hotel in this city.
I'm dying to see him.
What's the name of this intersection?
Where did you find the keys?
We cross the railroad tracks every morning.
I was choked by smoke.
He wouldn't look at my proposal.
I don't find that helpful.
I figured you'd be impressed.
He is far from happy.
Quit acting like a child.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
He's loaded.
I can't understand the meaning.
You may choose one of them.
Strange to say, no one voted for the candidate.
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer.
He is a dramatist.
I forgot something.
Be nice.
Do it again!
She gave me a fake phone number.
She ditched me.
Your sister's as beautiful as ever.
Perhaps you are mistaken.
There is a pair of scissors on the desk.
Do you have change for a fifty?
The car wouldn't start.
I remember this word.
He is very sensitive to cold.
The land had never been ploughed.
She was playing the piano at that time.
He is a psychic.
I don't remember it.
That sounds right.
I left my umbrella here last night.
We all want to know why you weren't here yesterday.
Have you solved all the problems yet?
Whose bike is this?
Yours is not bad, either.
My wife has faults. None the less, I love her.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I hope this won't affect our friendship.
Have you finished yet?
No minors allowed.
Do you want me to believe that?
As long as you keep quiet, you can stay here.
I'm being careful.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Are you going to take part in the contest?
Are you home?
Hold it with both hands.
He knows many amusing magic tricks.
About how many books do you have?
Tell Tom I'll be back.
I've spent way too much time thinking about this problem.
Tom put on a pair of latex gloves.
Let me explain it with a diagram.
The locomotive was pulling a long line of freight cars.
The train was delayed by snow.
Am I fat?
I ran for mayor.
I really want to kiss you.
For further information, see page 16.
We must avoid war by all possible means.
I don't know how to play pool.
Someone is watching us.
Don't forget to take your medication.
She has gone through many difficulties.
She's a single mother.
We were hoping something interesting would happen.
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your classmates.
I can't believe you just did that.
Are you finished?
We could keep it a secret.
I want to tell you about my problems.
You'd be the one to know.
My friend lives in this house.
I like each of them.
It would be better if you read more books.
You can't go yet.
We're going south.
There are plenty of fresh eggs on the table.
You didn't get very far.
My father takes a walk every day.
I had no doubts.
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
That's why I did it.
I'm running out of energy.
He arrived here last night.
Carry on with your work.
It's my son.
What's your favorite sport?
I don't like your boss.
Can we fix this?
How nice!
Fashion is not my specialty.
I used to be fat.
He hid behind the tree.
I thought you were kidding.
He'll be here any second.
Let's not overreact.
Are they all the same?
I slept just two hours.
I read in the newspaper recently that the crops really need rain.
I know I got it right this time.
I played with my brother.
Do you know how to program?
I think you're right.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
I accompanied her on a walk.
Drive carefully.
I want you to stop.
What're we looking for?
I didn't know what to do, then.
I have a feeling you'll be a very good lawyer.
Tom vanished without a trace.
I disagree.
A portrait of an old man was hanging on the wall.
I sat down and opened my laptop.
This is how I cook fish.
Leave me alone.
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy.
I love my life.
Are you really going to let Tom do that?
Could you send up some stomach medicine?
Do you agree with this?
It's your duty to finish the job.
Are we done?
Do you know where I live?
I'm interested.
This might hurt a little.
You should put on some clothes.
She's only interested in fish and cockroaches.
It went off smoothly.
I belong to the baseball team.
He's a community leader.
He treats me like his slave.
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
I wear my old coat in weather like this.
You sound like a broken record.
He found my bicycle.
Why didn't you say it like that?
You recovered quickly.
Do you know who wrote this book?
Stop right there, please.
I have some gifts for you.
You're winning, aren't you?
Blondes earn 7% more than women with any other hair color.
We're being attacked.
No matter how fast you drive, you will not get there on time.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
I want to go bowling with Tom.
He acted like he owned the place.
Tom got time and a half when he worked beyond his usual quitting time.
Didn't you go out?
I'm deeply offended by this.
Why don't you talk to him?
What time did you arrive there?
You were right after all.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
I've been looking for it all morning.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
There was fighting in the streets.
He put the phone down.
They did it in front of the staff.
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
He has the ability to make a good plan.
I'm not mad.
They think the owner of the house is studying abroad.
Tom is constantly complaining.
I think you're funny.
The train is always on time.
Please show me that.
You have cute eyes.
Everything's fine.
Could you please briefly introduce yourself?
You're just the person I want to speak to.
Everything looked nice.
I need volunteers.
Look at that picture.
Why are you calling Tom?
She likes Chinese food.
I feel ashamed.
The bad weather delayed the plane's departure by two hours.
What should I bring?
I thought we were happy.
I wonder if you could help us.
Do you have to work today?
How did you come by this painting?
Tom has excellent reflexes.
I don't like anything.
Would you step aside?
Fruit tends to rot right away.
She excused herself for coming late.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
What a pity she can't come!
I don't think that's possible.
My father doesn't waste his time.
They've been at it for hours.
His father is a physicist.
She beat him to death.
Who was here?
I feel much safer now.
I need you to see this.
I play volleyball a lot.
I have a heart problem.
I went to the shop.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
Let's keep quiet.
Tom can't have written this letter himself.
I know what may happen here.
I know I'm alone on this.
We're counting on you to help.
I was horrified.
He's waiting for you at home.
I know you've got a gun.
I waited for you to get out of prison.
It is a very difficult job for us.
Tom is working as a security guard.
In a town with only one barber, who shaves the barber?
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
This might interest you.
We went to the theater early, so we could be sure that everyone could get a seat.
She told him not to worry.
I am loved by my mother.
Why blame just Tom?
Who's the fastest one here?
He may be sick in bed.
She likes music very much.
I had a bad dream last night.
He tried to attract her attention.
He drives very fast.
Eat whatever you like.
Don't you tell me my job.
It takes about ten minutes to boil an egg.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
I have just arrived. I haven't even unpacked my bags.
Nothing will stop his going.
Call me if you find something.
I need some advice.
I'll get off here.
This medicine does not have side effects.
I felt reborn.
Can you please write that down?
We don't have class on Wednesday afternoons.
Tom knows that I lied to him.
I have nothing to do with this matter.
Can we create something out of nothing?
We suspected him of lying.

He was in the shower.
I don't believe it.
There is a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
It costs $100 a night not counting tax.
Do you know where to go or who to ask for information?

I've heard that you can kill werewolves by shooting them with silver bullets.
Why are you waiting here?
My father can swim, but my mother can't.
If you don't like the service, don't leave a tip.
I know this is hard for you to understand.

I think it's too risky.
You can take it.
Get down.
I need some volunteers.
They hang out together all the time.
That's all I was waiting for.
Tom asked Mary to brew some coffee.
The streets aren't safe at night.

We got lost in the fog.
I'm cleaned out.
I will bring it right away.
Get to bed.
I got divorced.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
I want you to do something about it right away.
You never tell me anything.
An ugly man knocked on my door.
We went to the park to take pictures.
I need a keyboard.
I have lived here for thirty years.
I bathe every day.
We're powerful.
I just want you to tell me why you lied.
I don't think this is a good time to talk to Tom.

What did you do this time?
Don't read my journal.
Smoking is not permitted on the train.
The rain made it impossible for us to go on the picnic.
You're very talented.
He wrote me a letter.
I'm going to the police.
She attributed her success to good luck.
I advise you to change clothes.
They made fun of my accent.
I didn't know whether I wanted to go to university.
I beat him at golf.
I just really need some time alone.
Will that make a difference?
Is it necessary for me to attend the party?
I am looking for a book about medieval Spain.
I rang the bell.
He prefers football to baseball.
We ate lunch together and then we chatted for an hour.
I hope something good happens before the day is over.
Rainforests provide the earth with many benefits.
We're unemployed.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
How did you answer Tom?
I felt as if I had no choice.
Did I not mention that?
You ought not to miss it.
I guess I could use the company.
It must be there.
Go play outside. It's a beautiful day.
She was almost late for school.
Don't expect any mercy from me.
It was a very big room.
Don't say that.
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
He looked back.
I downloaded it.
You're invited.
Tom asked Mary to read the letter.
I have to talk to you alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I talked about music.
Tom is probably just a little younger than Mary.
Don't talk to him about it.
I don't take orders from you.
We've been here before.
There's nothing fun about that.
I have no idea to what extent I can trust them.
She approached him with a smile on her face.
Tom helped me with the move.
We have to get these people out of here.
I will need your help.
Would you like to be seated?
That's how he invented the machine.
Tom doesn't look particularly pleased.
Do it quickly.
He acts as if he were a king.
Wouldn't you rather spend your time doing something you enjoy?
I'd appreciate it.
What are we doing for lunch?
I considered not going.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
Three were wounded.
She managed to learn how to drive a car.
I saw the boy in brown shoes.
Tom stopped at a convenience store to buy some milk.
I'm beginning to see what you mean.
Are you on drugs or something?
Is that all clear?
Would you please autograph this book?
We weren't all that hungry.
Please tell Tom Mary called.
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
We have to make sure that we never do this again.
Is it a military secret or something?
Spare me the details.
There is no answer to your question.
Tom followed his parents down the street.
This house is very comfortable to live in.
I am so tired that I can hardly walk.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
They do it faster than us.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
Did you try restarting the computer?
You ruined everything.
I work during the night.
You must be exhausted.
What's all the hubbub about?
I slept very well last night.
All the other boys laughed at him.
It was heart-warming.
Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything.
You won't be shot.
When will he be freed?
Don't be afraid to experiment.
Don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
How long will it take me to finish my homework?
It was almost noon when I woke up.
I don't understand why you're leaving.
You need to work fast.
Let's go outside for some fresh air.
Drop me a line.
You don't have to explain.
Many leaders supported the compromise.
Correct the errors if there are any.
I tanned myself on the beach.
How long does it take from here to Tokyo Station by car?
Tom has no problem with that.
Take as much time as you want.
I could never be like that.
It's pretty cold.
Had he known what was about to happen, he would have changed his plan.
You've got the wrong guy.
I'm not afraid of you.
I feel like celebrating.
The mouse was lured into the trap by a big piece of cheese.
An unforgettable event occurred.
I gave him a warning, to which he paid no attention.
I like you.
I loved you.
How did you get into the house?
I have heard nothing from him for five years.
They are very big.
Tom's plan seemed the best.
Your feet are dirty.
Is it to go?
I don't want to share the hotel room with a stranger.
I would do anything but that.
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
Tom dyed his hair the same color as Mary's.
She didn't show up.
I think she will come.
Don't let them go to waste.
Isn't that exciting?
I like the sound of the piano.
It's there to the left.
I feel very guilty.
These logs are heavy.
You'll have a rough time.
It seems like I'm going to have a hard day.
That's upsetting.
Please move your bicycle out of here.
How did the railway accident at Tokyo Station happen?
They live in tents.
How many kids do you have?
Our team is gaining ground.
Everybody knows that Tom likes Mary.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
He's drunk.
Nothing is impossible for God.
Do you hear that?
Be careful. That knife is sharp.
Tom is downstairs.
The cost of gasoline keeps on going up.
I thought we'd worry about that later.
"Let's go to the movies next time." "What makes you think there will be a next time?"
This can't be right.
I know the cure for what ails you.
I don't think they're married.
She liked it.
He keeps on phoning me, and I really don't want to talk to him.
That looked like it hurt.
That tower you see over there is the Eiffel Tower.
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.
Supper is a simple meal.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Isn't that what you're trying to tell me?
Thank you for helping me reach my goals.
I think you did the right thing.
There are many tall buildings in that town.
I saw you.
Here is your appointment card.
This cloth is really smooth and silky.
I recognized her the moment I saw her.
Everyone was there.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Beautiful stained glass is art.
Don't you have work to do?
Would you like to go have a drink?
You're never too old to learn.
We all deserve a chance.
Let me bring you up to speed.
Where should we go?
You don't know the truth.
Keep me apprised of any further developments.
He is likely to have a book and a cracker at his meals--and then forget to eat the cracker!
They couldn't find the problem.
My wife is a good manager.
I wish you'd stop doing that.
She borrowed the book from him.
Tom used to bake us cookies.
I love you guys.
How about sleeping at home?
Why do I have to do this alone?
They each received a present.
What did you find?
Everyone noticed.
It is interesting that no one noticed that mistake.
I'm creative.
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
Tom dragged himself out of bed.
Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.
There is no sugar here.
It is really time for us to go.
We're all sure of that.
Did you forget to buy eggs?
Did I hurt you?
All aboard!
I want to be in your life again.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
How old is your brother?
My fingertips are frozen.
Hang your jacket on the hook by the door.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I'll be at home in the morning.
How long do we have?
I thought you'd be more helpful.
You're stuck.
Seal the doors.
That's for me to decide.
Tom is really fast, isn't he?
Will you answer all my questions truthfully?
He was walking with a stick in his hand.
When will I get to Tokyo?
Please take a bath.
Tom grew up in a small town not far from here.
Nobody understands.
Sorry, I've got my hands full now.
One of the bulls pushed the fence down.
Don't play games with me.
Kick as hard as you can.
Don't you know who that is?
How do you say that?
It is Monday today.
You shouldn't trust Tom.
Watch where you're going!
I used to dream about becoming a model.
The doctor cured her of her disease.
We're not married.
He's a comedian.
I am having trouble with one thing after another.
I love the way you talk.
The line is busy.
It almost worked.
He's always breaking into our conversation.
She used to go to the museum on Sundays.
I was tired.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Look at that big dog.
She ate her dinner.
I began to sweat.
You ought not to call at this time of night.
Don't lose your purse.
Could you put these in a box?
I was trying to reach you.
You don't seem tired at all.
As soon as I left home, it began to rain.
He studied hard in order to get into college.
What are you doing to stop this?
We were caught in a storm.
The library is on the 4th floor.
Can I come over?
I haven't seen you in weeks.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
Make it smaller.
I need friends.
What could be the meaning of it?
It will not be long before he recovers from his illness.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
Websites collect information about you.
Are you there?
No one is amused.
He got off the train.
I have met her before.
You're part of this.
I have a great deal to do tonight.
I don't care what you think.
Luck is against me.
Was anybody with you?
Are you working?
Ancient archeological sites are under threat in Syria.
A room without books is like a body without a soul.
Tom and Mary agreed to work together on the project.
Of course, I understand.
I don't want a gun in my house.
Stop it right now!
It's my job to convince you.
This is never going to end.
Be nicer to your brother.
Who are we?
You're a traitor.
He told me the story of his life.
I went to Tokyo to buy this book.
Father went to a lot of trouble to prepare dinner for our guests.
You never cease to amaze me.
She wasn't friendly with him then.
You're my kind of gal.
This dictionary is my sister's.
He's not smart enough to add numbers in his head.
Is there anything else you want from me?
Why would you do something like that?
Tom has been called away on business.
Don't be angry.
Tom was dressed in black.
They caught Tom.
I sent him a letter to let him know my decision.
She advised him to see a lawyer, so he did.
They were very excited.
It's happening all over again.
Did you enjoy the show?
Did you put it somewhere?
Is Tom drunk?
Tell me where you went.
Look what happened.
Which students will take the test?
Did you make it by yourself?
Organic food tastes better.
He knows a lot about wild animals.
You're a true friend.
This sounds interesting.
Let's divide this money between you and me.
I have to tighten these bolts.
Who does this suitcase belong to?
I had a premonition that this would happen.
Five tremors in excess of magnitude 5.0 on the Richter scale have shaken Japan just this week, but scientists are warning that the largest expected aftershock has yet to hit.
The baseball game was put off till next Sunday.
How're you doing?
Don't worry. This won't happen again.
I like mysteries.
You need to be more careful from now on.
I enjoy cooking, but I don't like the cleaning up afterwards.
What's wrong?
Tom usually gives easy-to-understand explanations.
Nickel is a hard, bright silver metal.
All you have to do is to meet her there.
I'll arrange that for you.
Not doing one's work properly may be worse than not doing it at all.
Show yourself.
I must hurry.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
She was standing on a ladder painting the ceiling.
How are we doing for time?
I met her by accident on Third Avenue.
I want to be in show business.
It's possible that Tom lied to you.
"Thank you for helping me." "Don't mention it."
You're conceited.
Tom might be able to fix that.
I just did what you told me to do.
You look busy.
Why did you do this to me?
I didn't find it funny at all.
Do I have your permission to do so?
How many computers have you had so far?
I was a teacher.
Lie on your right side.
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
He's likely to be late.
I hate silent movies.
Don't be naive.
Thank you for your concern.
This isn't funny.
Am I dreaming?
What's your favorite subject?
This is by far the best.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
Cows give us milk.
She goes to the bookstore once a week.
Bring it here.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.

She got to the hotel late at night.
I really don't want to do that.
You ran a red light.
You need written permission.
I can read your mind.
Why don't you tell me what to do?
Please let me pick up your sister at the station.

He works as a gym teacher.
It wouldn't take all that long to explain.
Tom could be a spy.
Respect your elders.
You're wonderful.
Have a look.
You must pay in advance.
I won't pretend I'm sorry.
I leave in the morning.
You weren't even there.
I wanted to know what would happen.
I can't believe the way everyone is reacting.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
I wasn't informed.
Hands up! This is a robbery.
You shouldn't keep them waiting so long.
I just don't really understand.
I'm looking for my wallet. Have you seen it?
I wish you success in your work.
I don't know why we're so busy.
Tom sounded happy.
One of them is a spy.
I'm really proud of this.
There were no computers in the office.
I got the ticket for nothing.
Shall I get you a chair?
He has made up his mind to buy the car.
I feel awful about that.

I'll think about it.
We like doing things our own way.
It's fun to watch the race.
Tom doesn't care, but Mary does.
Tom can't see anything without his glasses.
I thought you were finished.
I freaked out.
It's really difficult to describe.
It is no joke.
We're joking.
Have you tried Japanese beer?
Maybe he will be a good teacher.
Where should I put my baggage?
Do you come here often?
I'm sorry to upset your plans.
Call me when it's done.
What's your phone number?
You should obey all traffic laws.
You may be right.
Tom wants to go with you.
Please speak French.
Oh, don't be so modest.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash register.
My blood pressure is quite high.
Are there any bananas?
Stop acting like a baby.
Come on, Tom. Let's go home.
It's not for everybody.
I can't keep it.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
He is now in a very difficult situation.
He was very scared when he saw this big snake.
Desperate men often do desperate things.
Was this man threatening you?
May I accompany you on your walk?
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
He managed to climb the mountain.
Don't speak so fast, please.
You're temperamental.

Is something bothering you?
He claims to have visions from God.

We should do this more often.
Have you told anyone about this problem?
How did you get into this line of work?
Is there anyone here?
I almost forgot to pay my bills last month.
Do you know how to cook fish?
I'm not really busy.
They were listening to the lecture attentively.
It serves our purpose.
I love your sweater.
I'll come by 10.
My sister is bugging me.
That's not for Tom.
Let's try again.
I still have mine.
How long are we just going to sit here?
The gardener planted a rose tree in the middle of the garden.

Women are beautiful.
He has his hair cut once a month.
Do you have something to do with this group?
What else do you have in your pocket?

Tell me what you want.
I felt excited.
Why don't we get our things and leave?

There is an urgent need for a new policy.

Be careful with my luggage.
Try not to cry.
Walking is an excellent exercise.
Take an umbrella with you in case it begins to rain.

This word comes from Greek.
You're not the only woman here.
Have you tried it before?
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
I can't believe I forgot.
He needs the money.
She was disappointed with the result.

I can't put up with all that noise.
Does anybody else feel that?

I can't feel it.
Get out if you can.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
You don't have to go.
I can't believe I listened to you.
Could you get it for me now?
"Top-down economics never works," said Obama. "The country does not succeed when just those at the very top are doing well. We succeed when the middle class gets bigger, when it feels greater security."
You're just the person I want to speak to.

I opened the window.
I am thinking about that matter.
I didn't change anything.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I object to being treated like a child.
He does it faster than you.
Japanese children are group members even when they are sleeping.
You're always saying that.
I'd like some time alone, please.
Do you find the work too hard?
I tried to talk a friend of mine out of getting married.
I think you know why I can't do that.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
I think it's better not to try it.
It was such a cold day that there was nobody on the street.
Let no one escape.
Tom is still inside.
Look up the word in the dictionary.
I'm not a teacher.
Nobody came to the party.
He listened closely to the speaker.
You are old enough to know better than to act like that.
After a few minutes, I began to lose interest in the conversation.
I can't stand it that she's suffering so.
Tom took Mary's hands and held them tightly.
What does he say?
Do I need to get the manager?
That's not my concern.
I often go out for a short walk just after lunch.
This is true love.
We're all retired.
I don't see what you're so concerned about.
I finished my sandwich.
I was confronted with many difficulties.
I love this photo.
He's checking his cellphone.
I'm accustomed to this.
He is a born poet.
There were a lot of murders last year.
He knows every inch of this area.
I don't agree with you on this point.
A is 5 times as long as B.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
As soon as I can get the chance, I'll send you some money.
Let's all just calm down.
It's because of you that I'm an invalid.
The only reason Tom went to the party was that he expected Mary to be there.
He is able to swim like a fish.
I'm glad I could help you.
Why did they hire you?
That's very big.
I just found it.
She went to see him the other day.
It's best not to ask.
Nobody answered.
You must go outside if you want to smoke.
We've been spotted.
He is smart.
I'll give it a shot.
We haven't seen you in a while.
I'd rather do this without your help.
What's your job?
I missed you so much.
This must be for you.
Warm and humid weather increases the number of crimes.
Look at this one.
There is a police car parked outside our house.
Let's not get discouraged.
Thanks for your quick reply.
Tom expected it to cost a lot more.
Look, I know that.
Can you tell us how that'll work?
I know you helped Tom.
Keep away from the fire.
I've upset you.
She gladly accepted his proposal.
Love is blind.
Stop being cruel.
Our football team has a good defense.
I managed to make him understand it.
Please don't be sad any more.
Go and get a chair from the next room, please.
Shucks! It was too good to be true.
How could you help me?
He walked back and forth on the platform while waiting for the train.
I don't like her face.
Get down.
Stand the book on end.
I fed the dog.
Do it by yourself.
Do not tempt me.
I'm not good at negotiating.
From the position of the wounds on the body, the police could tell that the attacker was left-handed.
I was curious to know why people had been staring at me.
Do you enjoy living dangerously?
I had to climb over the fence.
She grew roses.
Who is in this room?
What part of Canada are you from?
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I am going to bed.
This is very surprising.
Tom certainly is an eloquent speaker.
They can't get out.
We are working hard to make up for lost time.
How did you manage to do that?
I realized that I didn't want to spend any more time dealing with that problem.
Could you rewrite this sentence. It is not clear.
Unless you hurry, you will be late for school.
You have been warned.
She apologized to him for being late.
The drug must go through clinical trials before being approved.
We're giving up.
You're really incredible.
Studying how to communicate effectively is time well spent.
What's all the ruckus?
I think it's time for me to step aside.
Nobody wants to do that.
I guess I could use some advice.
Tom and Mary have gone.
I admire him for his courage.
I value our friendship a great deal.
Let me get you some ice.
You're the girl of my dreams.
I did think Tom might win.
He explained the matter in detail.
They go to church every Sunday.
He didn't like to ask for help even if he was starving.
You don't seem very concerned.
Who's your favorite lyricist?
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
I left everything there.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Words failed him.
I was just trying to be friendly.
We're not really sure.
The thief is certain to be caught eventually.
You don't seem to realize how serious this is.
The train leaves at nine.
Thanks for coming.
I'll tell you what to say.
The candle burned out.
She's in the hospital now.
There was only one case of chicken pox at the school.
Is that our problem?
It's for the children.
I'm too old for Tom.
He has a generous nature.
I have no further questions.
I didn't listen.
Do you really want to do this?
Draw me a sheep.
That's not the point.
I expected you to be here for lunch.
Why are you so concerned?
I do not know if it is love.
France borders Italy.
He enjoys wandering around the forest in his spare time.
One's point of view depends on the point where one sits.
We're trapped.
Tom carefully opened the box.
I don't need anybody's permission.
This is a difficult time for all of us.
Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.
What's troubling you?
That's not how I would say it.
Please call him up.
There are thirty students in the beginner's group.
I'll scream.
That's a very bad idea.
He did it without me knowing.
I'd like to reserve a seat.
Do you guys want to come, too?
He never looked back.
She was very excited.
Her face suddenly turned red.
It's a distraction.
They took a big risk.
Cut that out!
Did I drop that?
Could you please tell me again when the meeting is supposed to start?
I felt a little dizzy.
Show me a better one.
Faded jeans are still in fashion.
You won't be fired.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
He hates spiders.
I don't work for anyone.
I was off duty at the time.
We'd like you to sing a song.
Did you think about our offer?
There is a river between Saitama and Chiba.
I can't bend my right arm.
I know you feel lonely.
They often make fun of the boss.
Are you deaf?
If I had more money, I could move to a bigger house.
I go to any party I am invited to.
It costs 2 euros.
How did you end up here?
Is this ladder strong enough to bear my weight?
The barbells are heavy.
The atomic bomb destroyed the entire city of Hiroshima.
It's worth three hundred dollars.
He is a gentleman among gentlemen.
Tom and Mary have decided to get married in October.
Is he done using the telephone?
I didn't think you were needed.
Why did you lock the door?
I'm sick of this hot weather.
What do you make of all this?
I don't know how to interpret his words.
Leave this to me.
I just wanted to help the team.
I can be there in an hour.
Can I continue my trip?
I can't control myself.
After the meal, I asked for the bill.
The company is in the red.
I don't even want to hazard a guess.
Sooner or later, every parent has to have a talk with their children about the birds and the bees.
I'll be counting on you to bring a salad.
Why do you always seem to want to argue?
You're very timid.
I can imagine how you felt.
See what happens when you give people advice?
I want to leave this city and never come back.
It looks like the thief came in through the window.
It is never too late to learn.
I was sleepy.
We should do away with this regulation.
I got sunburned.
He was paralyzed with terror.
Tom sensed Mary's disappointment.
He works at a tattoo parlor.
I suggest a different approach.
Come and keep me company.
I do not believe in the existence of God.
Do you think I should go alone?
We need to have a contract.
Sorry I didn't reply sooner.
I met him while he was in Japan.
Tom is afraid of you.
You're so mean.
I'm impressed.
It'd be better to avoid her now, because she's violent.
I'm voting no.
I don't know if it will be fine tomorrow, but if it is fine we'll go on a picnic.
Is the bath ready?
That's not where I was last night.
She's teaching us French.
We had a heated discussion about it.
Who could forget it?
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
My aunt inherited the huge estate.
Don't screw it up!
Relax a moment.
Check this.
That was very good.
Let me explain it with a diagram.
Fill this out, please.
A dance will be held in the school auditorium this Friday evening from 7:30 to 10:00.
I live here alone.
Would you like to see your room?
Tom spends too much time on the computer.
You can't imagine doing that, can you?
Tom has no intention of staying in Boston for the rest of his life.
It's morning.
I don't have to apologize for what I said.
Are you going to do something about it?
This is the window which was broken by the boy.
If you could manage to go camping with us, we'd be delighted.
That has fallen out of style.
I've been to neither of those places.
The competition is fierce.
I can't stand it anymore.
It's quite large.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
She asked me what had become of him.
Keep running.
My room has two windows.
What did Tom want us to do?
January is the first month of the calendar.
I still don't get it.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I dream about you quite often.
Look at the next page.
The fans sought to shake the actress's hand.
The light is off.
Tom is going to regret it.
All this is for my personal use.
Can you tell us what you're wearing?
He told everyone.
He is always day-dreaming.
I bought this book the other day.
The deal fell apart at the last minute.
I'll be there at two o'clock without fail.
We ate together.
I'm definitely impressed.
I can't hear very well.
I'm sick of this.
I love the way you laugh.
I think it's time for us to come to an agreement.
When he came to, he was tied to a chair in the basement.
We're taking off.
We have a lot of time.
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
I didn't even notice you.
I am disgusted with him.
The door will lock automatically when you go out.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
I think you're going to want to sit down.
Your place or mine?
We waited, but Tom didn't come.
It's completely normal.
Is that a crime?
I am talking to my sister.
My patience is running out.
Tom still lives at home.
Tom died from tuberculosis.
This watch is less expensive than that one.
Do you want to play hide and seek?
Do you know which book sells well now?
Can you put up with the way he behaves?
A trust fund has been set up for each of the children.
Where did the accident happen?
I've been here for a while.
I'll answer that question.
I couldn't take your place.
Who're you calling now?
I'm really angry.
It is impossible for you to succeed.
I sprang out of bed.
We're very grateful.
It was clear that she was not concerned with the matter.
I'm really not hungry.
Is there someone with you?
He remained abroad ever since then.
I hate being stupid.
I've got some stuff to do here.
You're not helping me.
It's a cautionary tale.
How many people can do that?
I'm gaining weight.
They're not so bad.
Are you in Paris?
Can they see me?
He loves music.
I just got out of jail.
That chicken hasn't laid any eggs recently.
Do you love me?
The pain hasn't gone away.
You should always tell the truth.
I want to help you, Tom.
I think Tom's number is unlisted.
They haven't changed their mind.
Do you live alone?
He delivers newspapers.
I want you to go upstairs.
She called him on the phone.
I cannot understand what happened.
He's digging his own grave.
He saw there what he had dreamed about.
You're too slow.
It took me a while to understand what she was trying to say.
That is no business of his.
I wish I were as smart as you are.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'll talk to him at the earliest possible moment.
It was fabulous.
She is a very intelligent young lady.
It's so hot outside, you could fry an egg.
Tom kept singing.
They met in high school.
I'm really angry right now.
Show me your hand.
Tom did a pretty good job.
I don't know what to say about that.
I did the right thing.
My brother has a good memory.
Do you know how to drive?
He knows my wife.
We discussed what to do.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
The last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat vegetables.
They let me go.
You may use my car.
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
She easily catches cold.
Tom looks older than he really is.
I wonder if they'll get divorced.
My mother does not speak English.
What is the highest mountain in North America?
I can't tell you where Tom lives.
I can teach you how to cook.
I really want to get this work done.
He killed that man.
Can we go?
The bus will be here in five minutes.
Is this ball yours or hers?
Don't speak to him like that.
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.
I am in charge here.
I'm still intimidated by you.
He's here for me.
Tom is doing fine.
We'll go to any length to send our child to a good university.
I enjoyed swimming.
I'm proud of my father.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
I put on my shoes at once.
I think what impressed me most was the way Tom could talk to just about anyone.
Am I under suspicion here?
The toilet doesn't flush properly.
Speak for yourself.
You need to study more.
He does not seem to be very tired.
He drinks like a fish.
I've just finished lunch.
I don't want to shoot you.
I'll go crazy if this keeps up.
We can't do this again.
I want to stay.
I can come if you want.
Those photos are hers.
He found out the secret.
I want to give you the chance to do that.
Here is where it all happens.
Do you plan to go overseas?
She lived there about five years.
Do you know who this car here belongs to?
Do you drink green tea?
They treat their employees well.
Don't spoil your child.
They said that it was important.
Give me a hug.
Father wants to make me a doctor.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why are you doing this?
Let me have a try.
I hurt my foot.
How I've missed you!
The lake was frozen.
I've already eaten breakfast.
We were all on the bus.
We train together.
I just did what you told me to do.
When did I do that?
I hope you have a wonderful evening.
I haven't done that.
Tom showed Mary several pictures of his house.
They told me I had to help you.
We have a cat. We all love cats.
Is this the best you have?
I would've said yes.
I'm not sure when he'll turn up.
I ran into my friend.
Please sit on this chair and wait.
Don't you see what you've become?
Tom showed Mary his baby pictures.
He was very poor.
She was afraid to catch a cold.
Do you speak Chinese?
Tom refused to sign his name.
Tom hurt his knee when he fell.
They can't do that.
Making such a decision is not an easy thing.
It was her wish to go to Paris.
Nobody knows it but me.
I remember everything you tell me.
That's a good point.
How do they seem to you?
Do you want another one of these?
This is the village where I spent my childhood.
I'm very happy to be here.
No one will speak with me.
He likes to run.
I don't know if it's what he wants or not.
I'd rather be poor than rich.
Hey, what are you two up to?
They visited us.
I studied a lot in school.
You can't have the job.
I like neither of them.
Sorry about the mess.
Is he still here?
Tom drinks.
Come over for dinner sometime.
Don't let them go to waste.
How many ways are there to do that?
Some water, please.
That was no accident.
I love my mother.
Do you have any water?
Tom should've eaten more.
We are sorry we can't help you.
He doesn't have any proof.
There are several forms of government.
You're the greatest.
I have a surprise for you guys.
When will they give a concert?
I let you catch me.
Pick a card.
What are you supposed to do?
Are you coming?
I thought I'd lost you.
You didn't keep your word.
Our yacht club has ten members.
How about running?
I'm the second oldest of three children.
I don't know what plan he will try.
Don't let the dog sleep in our bed.
Stop that now.
I failed chemistry.
Can I talk to you for a second please?
I'll be there in five minutes.
A man's life has its ups and downs.
He lives in a port town.
These flowers grow in warm countries.
Sit down!
I don't have time to do what I want to do.
He was a former university professor and researcher.
We have to do the shopping.
You look nervous.
The joke's on you.
Give me the book.
Don't forget to include me in the count.
She shouted that she was safe.
I want to eat Korean food.
If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
I'm hit!
Those houses are my uncle's.
After her husband's death, she brought up the two children all by herself.
I already gave you half.
He is included among my friends.
I'm exhausted.
She did it again.
We had a lunch date, didn't we?
He showed me the way to the store.
He's shy, and never speaks unless spoken to. You have to talk to him.
I don't share your optimism.
No one knows what has become of her.
That's a tower.
I could do nothing.
I've ruined everything.
I fell in love with her.
That's all I'm trying to do.
They eat fish on Fridays.
We would like to stay here tonight.
Tom ran the fastest of all.
The book is on the table.
Are they Japanese?
We don't even know what we're fighting for.
I find you attractive.
Answer at once when spoken to.
I opened the door.
Tom started climbing.
He pushed the cat into the swimming pool.
She lives on a small pension.
I like to listen to classical music.
Did I not anticipate this?
He sometimes ate out with his family.
A tuft of hair showed from underneath her cap.
That's how it started.
I thought you were injured.
Have you seen my purse?
Am I a bad person?
Does anyone know what this is?
Sugar dissolves in water.
She was approaching thirty when I first met her.
Nobody does that.
We're not going to be able to call you.
I owe you one.
How lucky you are!
So, why are you here?
I have a diploma.
Where did you find this awful dog?
She complained of a headache.
He arrived after the bell rang.
No one disagreed.
I don't feel at ease here.
Our eyes take time to adjust to the dark.
Tell me when to stop.
Tom likes oranges.
She waved her hand to me.
Are you good at keeping secrets?
He owns a dishwasher.
I can trace my ancestors back 200 years.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Tom's prediction was accurate.
Do you like Wagner?
He listened to the news on the radio as he fed his dog.
Don't tell me what I know.
I really don't want to sit in the back of the bus.
I believe you, but unfortunately Tom doesn't.
I'm really not interested in history.
He was sentenced to prison.
I know I'll be able to do it.
Don't try to deny it.
Can you afford it?
I told her that if I could be of any use I would be glad to help.
Life is often compared to a journey.
They talked all night.
Shut up!
We played many kinds of games.
I want to talk to you about this report.
How far are we going?
We can't get close to the enemy.
I want to make that very clear.
I'm glad to see that you're studying harder than you used to.
They accused him of telling a lie.
I thought you might feel the same way.
He is lazy.
How was your afternoon?
Why didn't you listen to him?
I've had enough.
I am losing my patience with you.
I won't put up with this any longer.
The accused was sentenced to death.
Tom loved his kids.
There was another one.
The garage is dusty.
Tom's dreaming.
I want you to drop it.
Both spellings are correct.
She tempted him.
Please take me to the Grand Hotel.
I'll need to check my schedule.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I figured I might find you here.
I'll tell you afterwards.
You reap what you sow.
I feel useless.
I am grateful to them.
I want to have a word with you.
He can play a flute.
I just wanted to say thanks.
Earthworms are a gardener's best friends.
English is difficult, isn't it?

He's a computer nerd.
It's more complicated than that.
What is his shoe size?
Thank you for your concern.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Many people think that children spend too much time watching TV.
Are you still playing the bassoon?
We are teachers.
I met him by chance.
He'll be sure to smell a rat if I'm with you.
Let me show you an example.

You understand, right?

I don't even have time to read.
The situation became chaotic.
What's happening?
I don't know how to do that.
I did write to him.

I've never had problems before.
Is it always cold like this?
How could I forget?
Did you live here before?
I know his address.
The bus was almost empty.
How would you like your steak?
Take my advice!
Are you sure they can do this?
Do you have some money?
You should have stopped.
Is there something that you want to tell me?
That's a wise choice.
I ran home.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
I thought you were injured.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
Could you get in touch with him?
They talked about it on the telephone.
That sounded like a gunshot.
I can't imagine life without you.
She trusted you.
You should get rid of these weeds.
The dog is drooling.
Life isn't easy.
Tom put his ear to the door in an effort to overhear what Mary was saying on the phone.
I could use a drink.
I brought you some water.
I will do whatever you tell me to do.
Tom allowed me to go.
I'm really not up on recent TV shows.
She promised to marry him.
You have no right to do this.
Do you have professional experience?
I'm afraid of flying.

She teased him.
Would you like to meet Tom?
Tom, I'm in trouble. I need you to come get me.

Is Tom an artist?
I could help.
I knocked on the door, but nobody answered.

My father is quiet.
A stranger came into the building.
The news of the mayor's resignation traveled fast.
You can fix all this.

Don't you think we should at least give Tom a call?
I'm by no means angry with you.
You're the only person that I can trust.
She gave me a meaningful look.
He is on the radio.
You'll break it if you're not careful.

I like the way you look.
That door won't open.

It's all custom made.
I can't take that chance.
There's something I want to show you.
Are you going or not?
I have plenty of friends.
Don't do this.
Tom and Mary both shook their heads no.
All of them are good teachers.
So what happened to you anyway?
He's waiting for you at home.
We walked along the river.
I know the feeling.
Where can I go to get some good advice?
Is it always hot like this?
Please forgive me for not having written to you earlier.
This book is really old.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I don't like the way she speaks to me.
I just wanted to say that I love you.
We should probably postpone the competition.
The summer vacation is over.
Is this a letter?
You're crafty.
What was inside?
To tell the truth, I don't like him.
He fought until the end.
If you teach me how to dance, I will show you my hidden scars.

This is a great apartment.
He was arrested for fencing stolen goods.

I was a bit disappointed.
I felt betrayed.
Do I have to change my diet?
"If you're tired, why don't you go to sleep?" "Because if I go to sleep now I will wake up too early."
I will shoot.
I don't want to leave you.
How are you connected?
Come and see me.
He's my partner.
I'm calling from Tom's mobile phone.
There was fear in his eyes.
I thought your house was downtown.
You need to take a break.
I'd like to stand.
Tom sat down on the sofa.
What would you like to eat?
Do you know anyone who hums while they work?
My driver's license will expire next week.
Don't interrupt.
Nobody can foresee what will happen.
I won't tolerate such language!
I'm anxious to see you.
Is that all right with you?
Perhaps you should buy a gun.
Do you have a vacancy?
How big you are!
Mathematics is her weak point.
I read books.

Are you in a hurry?
What scared you?
She's my type.
It's clean.
This desk takes up too much room.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
It happened very fast.
She may realize later on what I meant.
Please refrain from pushing forward.
He may come today.
Who's taking responsibility for this mess?
Five plus three is eight.
The door of the office is yellow.
I go to school every day.
How does your opinion differ from his?
That guy is a crook.
I think Tom injured himself.
We loaded a lot of luggage into the car.
I like the melody of this song.
Remove your hat.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
They were afraid of being overheard.
Why would you want to do something like that?
I've heard nothing.
I need it by tomorrow.
It was out of his reach.
Say what you have to say.
Wait. I want to show you something.
If it gets boring, I'll go home.
I'm just as confused as you are.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I didn't even know his name.
I am not concerned with this affair.
You are taller than me.
I figured I could count on you.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
I had sore legs the next day.
I had the same thing happen to me last month.
Is that true?
My father was busy.
Why do you want me to wait in here?
He has big hands.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.

He approached the station.
I went, too.
When did this occur?

You don't have to eat it.
I'll give you another minute.
I'm surprised to see you smoking. You didn't used to.
My mother is well off.
He caught a terrible cold.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
He often attributes his success to his wife.
Being ill, I stayed at home all day long.
I'm really happy.
He clung to the hope that he would see her again someday.
The day is almost over.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Where were you on 9/11?
Don't tell my girlfriend.
None of this makes any sense to me.
They all changed.
It doesn't matter which team wins the game.
He was distracted by the beautiful girl.
This is my CD.
Everything's going to work out.
Even if he doesn't come, we'll have to begin.
I thought I'd be safe here.
I'm really not busy.
You look just like your father.
Can you determine what happened?
It was a mess.
You don't need to explain that.
His prompt action prevented an epidemic.
A great future is reserved for him.
How are you today?
Would you lend me some money?
Nobody backed up what I said.
It did not come off.
Take whichever one you like.
A bunch of people told me not to eat there.
Let me tell you my side of the story.
I wish I knew what you're looking for.
He was accused falsely.
You're really annoying.
I'm glad you came over.
They should have one.
Don't touch this!
Please copy this page.
Do you have a special menu for vegetarians?
The server was down.
Where are you staying?
A lot of soldiers were killed here.
More students apply to the university than can be accepted.
As you requested, I have attached a recent passport-sized photograph.

He is still sitting on the bench.
Don't open your umbrella in the hall.
I didn't know Tom could play the trombone so well.
They're coming.
Do you want me to leave?
The children are cold.
It's a cinch to learn to swim.
Are you coming with us?
I hope to build a new house next year.
They are all alike to me.
I'm getting kind of hungry. Let's go get something to eat.
In any case, I'll have to go there tomorrow.
Teachers should deal fairly with their students.
This is not a sentence.

Don't open your book.
I hate traveling.
They greeted me.
I arrived too late.
I never asked for it.
Get on the horse.
Luckily nobody drowned.
Don't run so fast.
You may park here.
Are you still up?
They made me wait for a long time.
I'd like to know more about Tom.
You're very emotional.
I need caffeine.
That's all I got.
Let's all take a deep breath.
Do you want children?
The students were all looking forward to summer vacation.
Are you sure everything's OK?
She wants a serious relationship.
I'd like to find out what this is.
We should probably ask Tom first.
They're not home yet.
She needs to help him.
I told you so.
Read it to me.
No one warned me.
Let me check.
Few people will admit their faults.
I'll meet you outside.
He is about to die.
Please write to me once in a while.
Words rarely have only one meaning.
You must be back by 10 o'clock.
I'd rather stay at home than go fishing.
So, why are you here?
Can I have two hamburgers and a coke, please?
I'll join you there later.
Walking is a good exercise.
I left my bag here.
They are exhausted.
That's where I went yesterday.
The soldier aimed his gun at the man.
It occurred to me spontaneously.
Don't bury your head in the sand.
We survived.
I was discouraged.
I suspected he was a liar.
You don't have the ticket.
Why are you so insecure?
She didn't visit anybody.
I ran in order to be on time.
The elevator is coming up.
Do your homework.
I'll fill you in later.
We're being blackmailed.
What's the skinny?
Some of the roses in my garden are white, and the others are red.
Tom is obviously a jerk.
I never suspected anything.
I can't find fault with him.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I owe you a dinner.
The snow melts in spring.
I'd like to visit Australia.
I was born in 1979.
You see that tall building over there, don't you?
I knew you'd come back to me.
Where's the nearest bathroom?
Don't you think that's probably a good thing?
She saved her baby's life at the risk of losing her own.
Would you like something smaller?
I saw the sunrise.
I thought you had all the answers.
If it were not for water, there would be no life on the earth.
I got dizzy.
Did you question them?
How did your dog get in here?
Might I ask your address?
No one was late.
I really liked what you cooked for me.
We're realistic.
Nobody'll ever find us here.
Have you ever heard her sing on stage?
Giraffes have very long necks.
Did you make this doll by yourself?
It is very cold here all the year round.
I'm not sure I believe you.
He heard the sound.
How was your trip?
That doesn't change how I feel.
We could continue.
I paid five dollars to him.
You'll wish you had studied harder.
I haven't got a chance.
He's not a bad boy.
I love strawberries on Christmas cake.
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
Are you going to help us or not?
I want a personal computer.
Call me tomorrow.
I promise I'll mop the floor tomorrow morning.
I think this is totally absurd.
I love spring.
I want us all under one roof again.
I had a little fever this morning.
Maybe I'll call you.

How far are you prepared to go?
You're the greatest.
You were shy.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
I do not have anything in my bag.
Does that price include breakfast?
I can't stand it any longer.
Please be careful.
It is none of your business.
I can see through your lies.
She would not disclose the secret.
I think it was an accident.
You are deranged.
What's your favorite sport?
She won't be pleased.
Be polite to your parents.
My kids don't usually lie to me.
I'd help you if I could.

You're stuck.
We're in charge.
What do you know?
Tom didn't really enjoy studying French.
Do you want to go out tonight?
I'm not wearing this.
I never thought I'd be doing this alone.
I need you to leave now.
I'm not patient.
You were drunk, weren't you?
Cleaning the garage wasn't much fun.
Sooner or later, I'll probably get bored.
It was very cold yesterday morning.
I want to let go of your hands now.
It's heavy, but I can manage it.
What did you get hit with?
Did you read all of it?
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
Science does not solve all of life's problems.
Let's go hiking this weekend.
We're truly worried.
It is a nice view from here.
It's the best thing I ever did.
What time do you go to bed?
Apples were served as the dessert.
Would you be so kind as to lend me your book?
I told you the truth when I told you I loved you.

I'd like to see your sister.
It might rain before evening.
Would you please stop pacing around like that and just sit down for a second?
I'll keep my word, whatever may happen.
It took courage to do what Tom did.
Why would anyone want to swim in this river?
I expected better of you.
They ate up all the cake.
I always drive at a moderate speed.
Tom is watching.

It seemed to be a good idea.
I've reduced the amount of meat I eat.

He dropped the cup and broke it.
You're very helpful.
He is old.
We know you're interested.
You've won!
Hurry, and you will catch the train.
I'm sure they'll win.
You're going to have to deal with that.
He is our teacher of English.
He couldn't concentrate on the conversation.
I'll pay later.
What would you like for breakfast?
One of my dreams is to one day see the aurora borealis.
He hasn't arrived yet.
He used his head.
Tom didn't want to sing.
Are you mentally ill?
I put it on your desk.
The teacher and I sat down face to face.
Is there a particular way I'm supposed to address you?
He's nervous and easily frightened.
Here's your change.
The kitchen is downstairs.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
We have very little time.
I know someone who can help you.
This is bad.
Do we have any chance?
They usually go to school from Monday to Friday.
Why didn't you apply for the job?
Tom won the game.
I want you to see what you've done.
Busy hands are happy hands.
You can't tell anyone about this.
I didn't see you.
I want them all shot.
You may talk as much as you like.
You're the only person I know who can probably answer this question.
We can't back out now.
It was nice and warm inside the house.
Can I see you in my office?
I asked what was wrong.
All of them died.
A boat capsized.
A bee flew out of the window.
Tom wasn't able to find a babysitter on such short notice.
How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
Could you bring me a blanket?
Aliens are often depicted with dark, almond-shaped eyes.
You must be in love.
Stay where you are.
You don't look Japanese.
Tom thought that Mary wanted him to kiss her, but he wasn't sure, so he didn't.
Did you have fun tonight?
He said it was out of the question.
How can anyone sleep with all this commotion going on?
I don't know either of them.
What are your thoughts on this?
I do not know how to drive a car.
Miyazaki is not what it used to be.
We all like him.
I wonder if she'll accept a belated birthday present.
I never went to sleep.
Divide the cake among the three of you.
I'm absolutely certain of it.
I don't know how long we've got.
It wasn't a party.
He saved me from danger.
I wasn't going to buy anything.
I have a dream.
You seem busy.
What kind of songs are popular these days?
All the guys teased me about it.
I could scarcely believe it.
Did I ruin your plans?
The Japanese economy developed rapidly.
It rained nonstop.
The press has been hounding the president nonstop about reneging on his promise not to raise taxes.
She was deceived by a friend.
I thought you'd left.
They did away with the old system.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Do you want any of this stuff?
You will need a bodyguard.
It has to be removed.
We're speechless.
I bought it last week.
I am afraid of dying.
How are you going to stop Tom?
He asked for money.
She wanted to help them.
Don't get an upset stomach by eating too much.
He had breakfast all alone.
Would you mind shutting the door?
They are no more alike than a cow and a canary.
I gave you fair warning.
It's better than the movie.
I want you to understand this isn't going to be easy.
I got all tongue-tied when she spoke to me.
I am only too glad to help you with your work.
There's a full moon tonight.
I need a job.
Can I have a word with you alone?
Do you like to study?
Compared to you, I'm just a beginner at this game.
I hope you're well rested.
She lost a book.
I need more money.
Let me show you something really awesome.
What do they know that we don't?
The vase was broken to pieces.
He distanced himself from politics.
No matter how hard the training was, she never cried.
I'm interfering.
Take one of these.
You don't have to wait until the end.
I appreciate your suggestion.
He couldn't help himself.
He is suspected of robbery.
I'll get him to carry my suitcase upstairs.
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
There's only one way to find out how to do that. Ask Tom.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
Is there a difference?
Tom remained silent for a long time.
I don't like oatmeal cookies.
You don't know that.
Since he didn't know what to say, he remained silent.
Please try again.
I worry too much.
That's all they had.
She didn't mind doing the dishes.
Can you pick it up?
I have an ear infection.
I left my coat here last night.
Please stop talking.
You're such an idiot!
I'm sure everything will be OK.
How do I thank you?
Those who don't want to go, don't need to go.
How do you think that makes me feel?
This dictionary has been of great use to me.
You may leave your bag here.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I'm a little confused.
It must've happened that way.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
He can't do that.
It must've happened that way.
Anyone home?
It's your only chance.
Are you Tom?
Is he just a one-trick pony?
The light turned green.
If it weren't for music, the world would be a dull place.
She approached him with a smile on her face.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
Do you want anything to eat?
You don't have to explain.

Are you afraid of the dark?
It looks like Tom doesn't really want this job.
Are you mentally ill?
Tom is currently living in Boston.
That's what Tom promised.
How's your project coming along?
Before he died, he was almost blind.
He was ashamed of his tears.
I know what's right.
Why would you say that?
I just want to let you know that I can't attend this afternoon's meeting.
Do you know who killed Tom?
Replace the old tires with new ones.
I think you're lying.
The proof is trivial.
Drinking was his ruin.
Be confident.
They're lying.
It's hard to speak English well.
I never laid a finger on her.
I think there's something we're all missing.
The deadline is approaching.
Will you show me what you bought?
Go to sleep.
I lent him a magazine.
She says she is seeing things.
Come back home.
I never imagined I'd be working for you.
I do want to be your friend.
The plan is not yet finalized.
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
I'm on a paid vacation.
She tore his letter to pieces.
I don't even know why.
It will become much warmer in March.
I didn't expect you.
Look up the word in the dictionary.
They're mad at you.
I have almost no money now.
Come quickly!
That car dealership has a reputation for selling lemons.
He was very pleased with the result.
Where shall we eat tonight?
Are you laughing at me?
He fell backward.
They're free.
The streets were covered with snow.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
Can you put up with the way he behaves?
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Don't forget to let me know when it's time.
They are not very different from anybody else.
Thanks for stopping by.
I don't feel so special.
She was burning with anger.
He studied economics at college.
This is why I quit the job.
We're having a blast.
Dolphins are curious.
All men must die.
They handled it well.
That's close enough.
Are you blackmailing me?
I have bigger fish to fry.
This is how I solved the problem.
They're all fake.
Please open the door.
Are you looking for us?
Have you finished writing that song you've been working on?
I saw it with my own eyes.
I take my hat off to her for her effort.
That's not how you spell my name.
Tom works at a nearby restaurant.
I was thinking about getting married.
I know the real reason for his absence.
What kind of wine do you recommend?
I feel the same way about you.
Put this medicine where children can't get it.
Cloning people raises serious ethical problems.
Who needs a drink?
You seem happy today.
She left the baby crying.
We could not overtake him.
Those are your options.
Ask anyone.
Catch the ball.
Have you ever been in a traffic accident?

Can you translate this manuscript from French to English?
Who am I to second guess him?
The boss is very upset.
You all right?
Read all the instructions carefully.
Can you continue?
Tom and Mary are still young.
You got the date wrong when you were filling in the check.
Your letter made me happy.
It was broad daylight when I woke up.
Tom was kissed by Mary.
The temperature has suddenly dropped.
I'm not easily offended.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
Let's be happy.
Have you slept?
A good idea occurred to him.
Where do they come from?
Are you expecting someone?
I want to file a complaint.
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
Tom doesn't appear to be paying attention.
Since you're here, you can help me.
Try it once more.

Mention Mexico, and tacos come to mind.

He's really in good shape.
I feel more confident now.
It's because he loves me.
He was thrown behind bars.
Beware of jellyfish.
I've read all about you.

I don't know how you can tolerate doing this over and over again.
He was late to the appointment due to a traffic accident.
These gifts are for you.
What do you think she is doing now?
He's incredibly talented.
Tell me where you've been.

Are you imitating me?
"Who is in the car?" "Tom is."
If it were not for the air, planes could not fly.
I don't want to force you to go.
I didn't pull the trigger.
I'm pretty busy.
She made him do it.
The accident has caused many deaths.
Would you carry this up to the second floor for me?
Did he show you the picture?
She advised him not to go.
This train will get you there in half the time.
He told the truth.
We must sleep outside today.
She needed the entire afternoon to complete the work.
He took the job without giving it much thought.
I was chained to the desk all day.
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
I'm supposed to be the one helping you.
He might come tomorrow.
I can fall back on my savings if I lose my job.
Can you determine what happened?
You're not married, are you?
Tom is seldom ever on time.
No one will survive.
I'll never be young again.
We're leaving tonight.
I'd like to ask you something.
I was there the other day.
Tom boiled some water.
Do you still remember how to do it?
I'm sorry for what I have done.
Tom collects comics.
She has put on weight recently.
Please sign your name on the contract.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Who else do you know here?
You're not entirely wrong.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
Light the candles.
The two of us are finally alone.
What drives you?
I wish our classroom were air-conditioned.
I had an early lunch.
He thought up an excuse.
I'm very poor.
That's actually pretty cool.
Would you mind if I took a picture?
All the rooms are taken.
Do you have enough?
When did you find out?
There is a little milk left in the bottle.

Please don't waste water.
He had fun with her.
I can't do this work alone.
I wouldn't want to be a judge.
Let's do it.
Tom doesn't know where Mary parked her car.
She stacked the trays in the cupboard.
That's really a great idea.
Why didn't somebody call me?
Hey, open the door.
You didn't come to school yesterday, did you?
What do you call that?
Don't eat between meals.
That sounds familiar.
It's impossible to reason with a drunk.
You must do as I say.
A rope was thrown into the water.
We should observe the speed limit.
I could do this all day.
I'll call you back later.
I can see much better with these glasses.
I really must be going.
Mary won't listen to her friend's advice.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.

Do you want to go get a drink?
This is going to be a challenge.

I didn't want you to miss your bus.
They are Christians.
He looked as if he knew all about it.
The slave tried to escape.
Your cat is fat.
It was just a matter of time.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
I dozed off in the train and slept right past my station.
Don't cast pearls before swine.
We can't trust Tom anymore.
Can I tell you something very personal?
Get some help, will you?
Just relax.
I don't think you really believe that.
He lacks experience.
Need a lift?
Someone stole my bicycle.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like this.
You should have seen it.
I'd love to go on an adventure with you.
She sounded mad.
They were scolded by the teacher.
I would like to see the festival.
You have our respect.

Aren't you dressed yet?
What do you think of these shoes?
I called them.
He took out his handkerchief.
Do you really not know?
Tom denied any guilt.
We can't be sure about that, can we?
I don't have anybody else to turn to.

Are you seeing anyone?
What a strange dog!
There is milk in the refrigerator.
I just can't get used to taking orders from Tom.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
That's alright.
What is the most romantic city in the world?
What happened to your car?
I've upset you.
If this airplane were to be hijacked, what in the world would you do?
I'm a new student.
I think that's the best answer.
I believe you.
I have found your dirty little secret.
Tell me what Tom said.
He was in pain.
Have you ever eaten chocolate-covered popcorn?
What seems simple to you seems complex to me.
I'm mad at you.
I don't care if the early bird gets the worm, I want to sleep.
Tom won't know.
Who would you like to speak to?
I'm thorough.
I saw a dog swim across the river.
Your dog always barks at me.
I don't think I can make it to your party.
Is that all you want to say?
I don't think anybody can help me now.
It's not worth the money.
I want to take a nice long vacation.
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up.
It's a lot more difficult than that.
I can't tell you. It's a secret and if I told you, it wouldn't be a secret anymore.
What's that?
He is always late for school.
You are a student.
You don't have to go.
Mathematics is basic to all sciences.
I'm a good guy.
Hey, this is nice.
Will you put down that paper and listen to me?

Her oldest daughter got married.
This is your lucky day.
Girls are often judged by how attractive they are.
I told you before that I'm not interested in hanging out with you.
It's cold today!
I don't think I can do this anymore.
He's a man you can rely on.
I'll find another job.
You can't help yourself.
I find that offensive.
What's the bus fare?
Tom didn't offer me anything to drink.
I can't handle them.
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
It's a no-brainer.
How may I serve you?
It's all downhill from here.
I wish you'd stop doing that.
Doesn't that car look familiar?
His parents were furious.
Have you finished your French homework yet?
Do you know where Tom is going?
It's all your own fault.
He came by bus.
He repaired his watch by himself.
I get off here.
The noise kept me awake all night.
At least they listened to me.
There must be something else we can do.
Things have been pretty tough lately.
I won't quit, no matter what you say.

What a miracle!
Boil some water.
My father has been in good shape since his operation.
This is the same watch that I lost a week ago.
The plates are dirty.
Ah! That clears up everything.
Can you validate this parking ticket?
I'm not very busy.
We couldn't stop him from hitting her.
I gave you fair warning.
What language do you speak?
Don't take me for granted.
I know you're nervous, but rest assured, you won't feel a thing.
You don't get it, do you?
Maybe you should just leave Tom alone.
I'll stay here until ten.
Is it important?
Now that my brother is a university student, he has to do a lot of reading.
It won't last long.
She waved her hand to us.
She sympathized with those unfortunate people.
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
What do you do in the afternoon?
Is there anybody here you don't know?
He came out on top.
I was in the right place at the right time.
I'd like you to keep this a secret.
We gladly accept your offer.
Tom doesn't seem to have any self-confidence.
I forgot to write the address on the envelope.
If you translate from your second language into your own native language, rather than the other way around, you're less likely to make mistakes.
We're all devastated.
You need a drink.
I said it was OK for him to go.
Has something happened?
Take any train on track 5.
We stayed there for three months.
Tom wants to talk to you.
If John phones me, please tell him I'll be back by seven o'clock.
The girl was afraid of her own shadow.
Houses built with wood burn more easily than houses built out of stone.
We can't keep doing this.
I saw tears in his eyes.

I've been on the phone all afternoon.
Why doesn't Tom want to go with us?
I don't want to handle it.
Wash your face and hands.
I stood under a tree to avoid getting wet.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
He's asleep.
I'll be happy to work with you.
You will be able to play tennis better soon.
Tom can't make it tonight.
I saw the picture you took of that fish.
We expect good results.
I love jokes.
I often hiccup.
She was a middle-aged woman.
I want my freedom.
Hey, Tom, can I ask you something?
Do we need to wait for her?
I don't quite believe what he says.
She will be back within a week.
I'll call if I hear anything.
Why don't you share it with me?
I don't even like fish.
I think you're interesting.
We listened to his lecture on the radio.
I have read every book in the library.
How did they come by all that wealth?
I loved that book.
I was reading a book while walking.
They love Tom.
They're all dead.
We're wasting precious time.
Everything's all right now.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
I did nothing unlawful.
After work, I go right home.
I take a bath every day.
Shouldn't you go home?
Are you lonely?
She always gets her own way.
Can you please stop that?
I suppose you already know that's my car.
What day are you usually free?
I was there.
Tell me where she lives.
Do you know the family?
How much are they offering?
I really like that.
You can take your time.
Isn't it profitable?
It's supposed to snow tomorrow.
He is a quiet man.

I didn't sleep much last night.
Tom doesn't know what Mary was going to do.
Will you do it?
I know you've been trying to help.
They saw little need for labor unions.
You must bear in mind what I've just said to you.
A man must work.
It's ached before, but never as badly as right now.
I'm glad to see you back.
Tom, it's not your fault.
I have to go even if it rains.
I have connections in the government.
I find you attractive.
You made a fool of yourself.
He hopes to exhibit his paintings in Japan.
I finally gave up smoking.
What do you think of this plan?
Some people believe in ghosts.
There was a large audience in the concert hall.
Tom is still inside.
Tom used to be in a relationship with Mary.
It certainly feels like it's going to rain.
This is an easy sentence.
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
He must stay in the hospital for a week.
I plan on being early.
That's Tom's house with the red roof.
I couldn't do anything about it.
Why were you absent yesterday?
Sorry I couldn't come over yesterday. Something came up.
I suppose you're right.
It's not supposed to happen.
I think you know what I think.
I want to press charges.
Suddenly it began to rain.
We went for a walk.
Is everybody okay?
Don't tell me to shut up.
How would you like it if I hit you?
Have you asked if they want one?
I guess you know I've missed you.
I've almost finished listening to the album.
I get good grades.
I made a pot roast.
Stop me if you can.
I think you're cute.
I go for a walk every day, except when it rains.
Not a day seems to pass without newspapers reporting the war.
I dare say he is right.
Tom did everything within his power to save the children that were trapped in the burning building.
She was ashamed of her children's behavior.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
Have you received the letter?
I want to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
He did not listen.
We haven't caught the thief yet.
Now drink up.
We have no complaints.
You were perfect.
They're old.
That guy annoys me.
I thought you'd want this one.
I wasn't too sure about it.
This sentence contains an error.
Tom wanted Mary to say that she loved him.
"I can't bear to be doing nothing!" you often hear people say.
You're never too old to learn.
I've never had a traffic accident.
I ordered this swimsuit from France.

He blew on his fingers to make them warm.
Wow! That looks delicious.

I don't remember how we ended up in Boston.
Black suits you.
He's a chain smoker.
I should have tried out this electric shaver before buying it.

Soon, it won't be unheard of to live to 150.
I like to play basketball.
Do you remember me?
Tom seems to have trouble walking.
Maybe we should start.
I'll do it with you.
Are these all the same?
All of them died.
Five thousand dollars is a large sum of money.
Are you so stupid that you can't see it?
The whole town was in an uproar.
Half of the world’s population lives in cities.
My father is in his fifties.
I really want to thank you.
He ran off with his best friend's wife and hasn't been heard from since.
He asked his father to take him to the store.
Water covers about 70% of the earth.
I had to do my duty.
Just say no.
We want to protect this world we have.
This is just water.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
I'm really flattered to hear that.
She greeted me with a smile.
Who are you talking about?
You're too trusting.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
You're cool.
What's the problem anyway?
She is devoted to her three children.
Tom sent Mary a text message.
You're very curious.
What do you really think?
You have to go the rest of the way without me.
Tom certainly knows how to entertain people.
Her shyness makes me like her even more.
We're not home.
I never thought we'd end up like this.
He is a brave and cheerful boy.
She was wearing a negligee.
The police officer put handcuffs on the suspect.
I hate funerals.
I don't know if I'll be able to help you on Monday.
This car doesn't belong to me.
He's a bit rough around the edges.
He finally achieved what he set out to do.
That movie is exciting.
Don't touch this with your dirty hands.
Send the kids to bed.
The situation is deteriorating.
Won't you take a chair?
Please say hello to your wife for me.
She took her book.
I'll call him tonight.
I want to spend some time with you.
I feel worse today than I did yesterday.
Do you have nightmares?
My name is Tom and I'll be your server tonight.
Please turn out the light so that I can sleep.
No one would listen.
It all started on a hot summer night.
I want you to help me get out of here.
The war lasted two years.
That sounds like the kind of thing he'd do.
If you are to know a nation, you must learn its history.
No sailboat is faster than this one.
That was naive of me.
Look at that dog.
Why did he do such a thing?
I tried to save you.
I was really curious.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let me help you.
I didn't think I needed any help.
Please tell me what you saw then.
My job is giving me a stomachache.
Are you through with the newspaper?
Do you want to resign?
Would you mind if I have a look?
I feel sorry for her.
We're too old.
You won't stay, will you?
I'm not sure I want to do this now.
Our school burned down.
The children were so noisy that I couldn't study.
I couldn't walk.
They want this.
I must confess that my theory doesn't account for that fact.
I don't remember that happening.
I recommend you to go by train.
Could Tom have done this?
I appreciate all you've done for me.
How many of Shakespeare's tragedies have you read?
It's raining there.
If my brother hadn't helped me, I would've drowned.
He learned how to raise cattle.
I sat down next to him.
He had suffered some failures.
You're very attractive.
He fooled her.
She may spill the beans.
Do I know you?
Don't you think I know what people say about me?
There's no mention of it here.
You're very good.
Because of Tom, Mary has become depressed.
You obviously don't have time.
How about running?
He hung a picture on the wall.
I like these hats.
He was stunned.
Don't tell me what to say.
Either you or your friend is wrong.
There were no more than two books on the desk.
Let's meet halfway between your house and mine.
She showed me a letter written in English.
Tie your shoe.
I don't want to be your friend.
Let's wait here until she comes back.
Do you sometimes go abroad on your holidays?
Do you know where she is?
It is high time you went to bed.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
I have backstage passes.
What color are you going to paint Tom's bedroom?
I got a stomach tumor and had to have it operated on.
Tom is fishing for trout about a hundred meters downstream from here.
Are you sure of it?
Your answer is wrong.
Write carefully and legibly.
I don't think I can make it to your party.
I'll join you in a moment.
Buy low, sell high.
The public demands answers.
Christmas is only two weeks off.
If I were in your situation, I would do the same thing.
I asked her to make four copies of the letter.
Is that the train I have to take?
I don't remember, but I wish I did.
We drank a lot.
He was court-martialed for dereliction of duty.
Above all, logic requires precise definitions.
I made a lot of mistakes back then.
The answer to your question is no.
This clock gains two minutes a day.
I have different priorities than you do.
I am very glad to see you.
Tom certainly got the message.
This is the end of the world as we know it.
Tom would describe the house as small.
Everybody's so busy.
No one is in the room.
I don't know what you mean.
I ironed the handkerchief.
What is it you want to sell to us?
What do you think this is?
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
Valentine's Day is on Sunday this year.
I assume your mission was a success.
We're sincere.
Some civilians were killed.
You should cut up your meat before you eat it.
What's this smell?
He is likely to win the game.
I'm very fat.
Maybe he won't become famous.
Bring me some water.
I know your face.
He is a danger to society.
I'm tired of watching television.
How do you read this kanji?
At a young age, I had to learn to fend for myself.
Everyone is looking forward to watching the game.
I am sure this book will be of great use to you.
You can't change Tom.
Catch you later.
I just want you to think about it.
Tom doesn't want to be late.
I don't have a badge.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
Don't try to get up yet.
I would never have guessed that.
Are those explosives?
You're not dead yet.
His proposal was worthless.
Tom didn't accept my apologies.
Nobody's forcing you to do anything.
Tom handed the key to Mary and she opened the door.
Time flies like an arrow.
I can't force you to do anything.
Close the door, please.
Nothing lasts forever.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
How was your birthday?
Put some clothes on.
He hit two birds with one stone.
Most of my friends are girls.
Where do you come from?
Is this your dog?
What would you like to do today?
Call us.
I called her office, but no one answered.
No way!
She got married at seventeen.
I could have done it without your help.
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
Tom was mugged on his way home from work.
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
I want to get to know you.
She remained silent all day.
I heard shots being fired.
It's like one of those.
It may rain around noon.
Fear of failure prevents many people from reaching their full potential.
I am too tired to climb.
The war brought their research to an end.
He received me cordially.
Tom and Mary have been trying to come up with a solution to the problem.
I'm by your side.
I've got claustrophobia.
We're all angry.
Does she still have a temperature?
How much money do you spend on textbooks per semester?
One can't help many, but many can help one.
Is Tom still at school?
He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing.
I need you here.
You should avoid binge eating.
I don't want to be your boyfriend.
I don't know if you'll be here when I return.
If you want me to play the piano, I'll play the piano.
We see each other once a month.
I appreciate all you did.
She went to Germany to study medicine.
Is one of you Tom?
Would you like to come to my party?
Can you please tell me what time the train leaves?
I thought you'd gone and left me.
My father bought me a bicycle.
I don't want any fruit.
It is none the less true.
It doesn't matter.
You're very wise.
Don't you think it's wonderful?
He offered more than could be expected.
The temperature has been below zero for many days now.
At last, he solved the problem.
Having worked on the farm all day long, he was completely tired out.
What you spend time doing in your childhood affects the rest of your life.
I can't afford to pay so much.
We've run out of food.
A bunch of people were standing outside waiting.
Is he tall?
She is likely to live to be one hundred.
I knew you'd be mad.
I have a solution in mind.
How do I know this isn't another one of your tricks?
Would you like me to tell the truth?
I need more light.
Tom most certainly would not approve.
That's not funny.
That's lovely.
She was advised by him to lose weight.
How did you come by such a job?
I think he's attracted to you.
I think Tom is in his office.
Leave my family alone.
It's nothing short of a miracle.
We have no idea about his whereabouts.
I'm so confused.
Where has she gone?
That's my boy.
The road is too narrow for cars.
I'm just watching TV.
How do you remove red wine stains from your carpet?
I no longer need a loan.
These trousers need pressing.
Is Tom able to eat?
It's all yours.
I think Tom needs your help.
I beg you.
You must continue to train.
I don't care for coffee.
Why don't we call it a day?
Did you say something?
They basked in the sun.
Tom is extremely busy now.
My arm still hurts.
My father has already given up smoking and drinking.
I would like to go for a swim.
He is a teacher of English.
You will never defeat me!
They were unimpressed.
You're out of excuses.
Tom should know that.
Take all the time you want.
It was all a big lie.
He is sharp-witted.
I'm sorry, I really am.
I finished first.
You have to go.
What should I do to stop hiccups?
He wasn't there last week.
I had trouble finding my way back to my hotel last night.
Tom knows how to tell a good story.
How was the wedding?
She should be there at noon.
Their house is far from the station.
I am seventeen years old, too.
Please be serious.
Hold on a minute.
You will be able to speak English.
I knew you would do something great.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
I don't know how I know.
I think that's a great idea.
They won't find it.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Tom opened the safe.
I'm assuming this is your father.
The breakfast dishes were still in the sink.
I want to get better at chess.
Let's go to eat together.
The weather forecast was right.
Were there any problems?
I didn't consider the subject seriously.
Our team is still undefeated.
Can we speak now?
Be fair.
Preheat the oven to 130 degrees.
How old are the children?
I'm going to take care of it for you.
Why don't you love me?
All we can do is wait.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
You're very sophisticated.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
I used to go ice fishing when I was younger.
You knew this would happen, didn't you?
I have many friends I can talk to.
My wish is to be a singer.
I didn't move a thing.
My uncle has completely recovered from his illness.
The helicopter landed on the roof.
Did they live here?
What do you have against those people?
This is the perfect location.
They are both unmarried.
I plan to go there alone.
Tom is going nuts.
I couldn't stand.
That's why I came late.
Can you say that again?
What a stroke of luck!
I'm not a soldier.
You're a jolly good feller.
He's greedy and lazy.
Will you ever forgive me?
We're interested in observing the customs of different regions.
You know, I had a lot of fun.
It's impossible to do that.
I wouldn't be so sure.
There's no sugar.
I can't bear the thought of losing you.
Do you work here?
Turn your papers in.
I'll let you know.
I'm not sure what I was thinking.
Who's the woman with the red hat?
The girl resembles her mother very much.
You have no right to be here.
I don't like the way you're acting.
All of them went there.
You're such a mean man.
Her house is at the foot of a mountain.
Wait until your father gets home.
You should be more careful the next time.
Grab him.
Suppose you had ten million yen, what would you do?
Is that still my room?
None of the old trees survived the fire.
Aren't you hungry, Tom?
It's our only show.
We enjoyed ourselves at the seaside all day.
She thanked me for the present.
He has a Japanese car.
Are you happy with your weight?
That's woefully inadequate.
They kept talking all the time.
I have to make a decision.
You can't trust computer translation.
He wanted to buy a book.
Tom doesn't wash the dishes. He leaves that up to Mary.
Tom misses his wife.
It would be counter-productive to do such a thing.
The rainforests are disappearing at the rate of tens of thousands of hectares a day.
Why don't you love me?
I'd like to watch TV.
I want to make friends with your sister.
Have you got any ideas yet?
Tom asked Mary who she was looking for.
The letter was written by Tom.
Tom plays organ at our church.
Save me some ice cream.
Would it be ethical to sacrifice one person to save many?
You look like a cop.
The mirror is on top of the dresser.
I just want things to be normal.
Where are we going tonight?
Are they actually friends?
I like women.
Tom is only thirty years old.
Add a little milk.
Yes, it's true, but he doesn't need to know that.
It's worth checking out.
Those are very famous people.
Rabbits have long ears.
I'd like to drink something hot.
I didn't realize you were serious.
In any case, I'll inform you when he comes.
Where did you hide it?
New Year's cards provide us with the opportunity to hear from friends and relatives.
What do you think happens then?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
This gives me the strength to go on.
He's scared to talk to me.
I left in kind of a hurry.
Where do they come from?
How's your mother?
When I was your age, Pluto was a planet.
Don't get so excited!
Don't be scared to meet new people.
They were very confused.
Eliminating the deficit will be a very difficult job.
Tom doesn't know what's going on.
Shepherd tried to run and was shot.
I'm so sick of this.
That makes no sense.
She gave me a wonderful present.
That's the one thing I can't do.
When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person.
I don't want to quit this job.
You should begin right away.
You're finicky.
They're cold.
What would I do without you?
I think you really mean it.
You didn't make it clear.
The sky grew darker and darker, and the wind blew harder and harder.
He has a habit of keeping the door open.
I think you did the right thing.
Her long hair was completely wet.
He goes to school by bicycle.
I feel bad for that guy.
I'd like to go to college.
I was distracted.
This is the latest fashion.
I plan to tell Tom about you.
What are you staring at?
They must be happy.
His lectures are very long.
The city was bombed by enemy planes.
I like to fish in the river.
Where are you hurt?
Do your homework right away.
He had a lot of money in the bank.
Tom and I used to fight a lot.
I will have finished the work by noon.
I'm extremely happy.
We should have gotten married.
I should quit.
Bring me another fork, please.
He took a step forward.
I'm smarter than you.
They tapped the terrorists' phone lines.
I've just gotten home and had dinner.
I will not be defeated.
Two tears fell down her cheeks.
I don't want you to leave.
I have one thousand dollars in travelers' checks and five hundred in cash.
Practice what you preach.
We got up at dawn.
I called him, but a girl answered the phone.
Tom stole the ring.
The blockade by Britain and the other allies was very successful.
Did you find anything?
We all cried a lot.
I needed money.
Don't act like a know-it-all.
Since my mother was sick, I looked after her.
I need to take care of my kids.
Someone said Tom is looking for us.
It was a nice story.
I feel blue.
There is a cat under the bed.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
I took my shoes off.
Is that too hard?
I'll meet you at the bus station.
Leave that job to the experts!
That's all I can say at the moment.
I may have made a mistake.
I met him on my way home from school.
He ordered me to go alone.
You should receive them by the end of the week.
Dinosaurs used to rule the earth.
I rarely listen to the radio.
Tell me what happened.
I want a round-trip ticket to Chicago.
It's not hard.
My little brother always sleeps with his teddy bear.
Lunch is on.
You're such a liar.
Tom likes the ocean.
How much do eggs cost?
Please take a look at this picture.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
I don't mean to pry, but are you having problems at home?
I let the cat out of the house.
Tom and Mary were busy.
I know what your name is.
Don't play games with me.
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I'm sure that you'll succeed.
Don't watch too much TV.
Do you plan to stay long?
His wife died in childbirth.
Tom didn't really mean that, did he?
You're old.
Please don't leave valuable things here.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
I don't want to play golf.
I wish my father had lived longer.
He wasn't there last week.
Stand aside.
She's at the hotel now.
I think the prices in this store are way too high.
Are you going away this summer?
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
Nothing is going to happen.
Is the world more mad than usual this morning?
I wrote that.
She had a narrow escape yesterday.
You should allow an hour to get to the airport.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
It was very nice seeing you again.
Do you have health insurance?
I'm sorry I hurt Tom.
He admitted his mistakes.
You look busy.
That's not what you used to say.
How's the weather?
I was looking at her.
Be more careful from now on.
I'd like to kiss you.
I could never harm you.
I think you might want to check this out.
Do you like robots?
Is there anything you want to know?
We heard a gunshot.
Please excuse my being late.
Leave immediately!
You have everything.
I don't like to lose.
I have been living here for a long time.
We have to deal with that first.
The teacher gave way to the students' demand.
You need to stop.
She drives me crazy.
What are you up to?
Do you remember your father's birthday?
We don't have as much in common as I thought we did.
I'm going bald.
I'm really old.
I usually eat lunch at 11:30 to avoid the rush.
I want to know who they are.
She became a doctor.
I want the truth from you.
Students should try not to be late.
I'm still intimidated by you.
I thought you'd ask that.
Don't underestimate yourself.
Give me something to write on.
I help him.
Some people seem to agree with you.
Look, I'll show you.
I have enough money to buy this.
She took off her old shoes and put on the new ones.
Are we friends?
She was advised by him to listen to her doctor.
The computer is a relatively recent invention.
I know that Japanese songs are very difficult for us.
Do it when you have time.
The five of us stood in a circle holding hands.
I do not feel like doing it.
What time does the movie start?
He went to bed because he was tired.
English is not easy, but it is interesting.
I shoot the rabbits in my garden with a squirt gun to keep them away from the vegetables.
You never can tell what kind of job you might find.
I expect that Tom will pass the exam.
You look busy.
I'll make some coffee.
We have no way to verify this.
She pleaded with him to stay.
What has he done?
You should be more careful at a crosswalk.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
What is his business?
Why don't we share a room?
Don't rely on him.
His loss of memory is a psychological problem rather than a physical one.
This is my school.
I'm concerned with Tom's safety.
He had an accident and fractured his leg.
If you do this, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
It has become much warmer.
I can't just do nothing.
I hate studying.
You can easily judge the ripeness of a banana by the color of its peel.
The book is on the table.
Let's do it your way.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
I used to swim every day when I was a child.
Do you want me to be your bodyguard?
She suddenly fell silent.
She's worried about your safety.
Go away.
We're trying.
She closed her diary slowly.
He felt lost and uncomfortable.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Tom changed jobs.
Is it a recent picture?
Some newspapers distorted the news.
I think we should stop now.
Let's take a taxi.
Who would like to go first?
Are you still sleepy?
I have to go back.
I just got back in town.
I know what those books are like.
Whatever you do, don't push that button.
Two thousand people fit into this hall.
I can't believe you're doing this.
What happens if I press this button?
She turned to the left at the corner.
It's too narrow.
I don't know what to say.
You need to be careful.
Is your name on the list?
I hope you had a good time at the party.
You're not fat.
A square has four sides.
The Rhine runs between France and Germany.
The most beautiful girls are from Lithuania.
She may not come.
You're disgusting.
The more I sleep, the less I feel like working.
Thank you for your help.
Tom certainly fooled Mary.
She asked me about my mother.
You're very astute.
Don't make a sound.
He's still at work.
Who's this guy?
I made them myself.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Stay away from my daughter.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I want to find my own place.
I'd rather stay home and sleep all day.
I am glad to help you.
She advised him to take better care of himself.
She is proud of her students.
I can't concentrate with all this commotion going on.
I felt somebody pat me on the shoulder.
It was a weird feeling.
She didn't want him to play poker.
I remember meeting him in Paris.
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain.
Do you carry a weapon?
They accused me of being a liar.
I knew this would happen.
She died in a plane crash.
Anything is OK with me.
Can you still remember the time we first met?
Are you at work?
Are you envious?
It's still not ready.
You're the greatest.
We now know that the testimony he gave was coerced.
I brought a book.
Tom got a call from someone named Mary.
That's the eject button. Don't touch it.
I don't have any Canadian friends.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
Hang your coat on the hook.
I don't want to know any more.
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
This blouse is cotton.
I underestimated you.
I took care of it for you.
Does this bus go to the center of town?
I have been busy for two days.
I'll begin by asking a question.
I live just up the road.
I'm being held hostage.
He thinks he is somebody, but really he is nobody.
Help yourself to anything you'd like to eat.
Why do you want to go out with me?
Could you take me to a hospital, please?
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
She is too young to know the truth.
Everyone was speechless.
If you do your best, you're likely to succeed.
Do you remember the day when we met first?
Tom and I have nothing in common.
Where is my seat?
According to the contract you may take three days of bereavement leave for your uncle's funeral, but only one for your nephew's.
My work is finished.
I'm busy, too.
What movie was it that you told me I should watch?
Would you be willing to help?
She took the book back to the library.
I can't wait for you.
I can't believe you fell for that.
You're going to win today.
I don't date.
Tom wanted the job, but they didn't hire him.
The mayor addressed the general public.
Tom works at a pizzeria.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
I'm not in the mood right now.
What is done cannot be undone.
You shouldn't get married.
I can't believe you said that.
I think I'd like to be a better student.
I often lie about my age.
How could this be?
Could you bring us the bill, please?
Tom took the scissors away from Mary.
I'm being paid to do this.
The boy was afraid of the dark.
Everyone is hoping nothing bad will ever happen in Japan.
I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.
He's got an uncle who works in a bank.
Not everybody graduates.
I haven't broken any laws.
They're just students.
I'm out of breath after running up the stairs.
She screamed for help.
He's young and attractive.
I need nine hours of sleep.
Your parents can't keep us apart forever.
Most public places are simply not geared to people with disabilities.
I'm proud of my brother.
We found a nail stuck in the tire.
There is no excuse for such behavior.
We're not giving up.
We're not happy.
I asked Tom.
You're fair.
They kidnapped me.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
Did you write down the number?
You are responsible for the result.
I agree with everything you've said.
Tom doesn't want to see you.
It hurts here.
He's raking it in.
How is this possible?
It is never too late to learn.
We must have something to live for.
I knew someone would come rescue us eventually.
It's not that difficult.
Do you actually live here?
Tom is insanely jealous.
I'm looking forward to the party.
The whole nation wants peace.
This color is a bit darker than that one.
Don't let the kid play with knives.
I heard that a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
I probably shouldn't have done that.
One way to lower the number of errors in the Tatoeba Corpus would be to encourage people to only translate into their native languages.
He says that he wants to settle down.
We can't get out of this.
I require your assistance.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Everything is on schedule.
Lock the door.
It's hotter here in the valley than in the mountains.
We've already met.
See what I mean?
I hope you have brains enough to see the difference.
We don't want to take any chances.
Who made this box?
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
Do you think she's pretty?
This never gets old.
I didn't want you to get involved.
Is this a date?
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
He is completely absorbed in his business.
Their loss is our gain.
My waist size has recently increased. I guess it's middle-age spread.
Is anyone else going?
I don't have them yet.
He is old enough to drive a car.
Have you ever done any volunteer work?
What right do you have to order us around?
This is for you, Tom.
Tom stood there for a while.
He gets hives when he eats eggs.
I guess Tom wasn't really Mary's boyfriend.
Would you like one?
I baked it this morning.
I wonder if Tom has one I could borrow.
I would like to know how these substances are absorbed by the body.
You don't have an alibi for the day of the murder.
You don't have to go.
Tom took a bite of my apple.
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.
Get out of here before I call the cops.
Where did I put my coat?
Tom was like a brother.
It's not for everybody.
I'm from Tokyo.
Although she is rich, she dresses quite simply.
I hardly know anything about you.
I've got to get back to work.
She locked the door.
The cost of living is very high in Tokyo.
I have almost no appetite.
He pinched me!
He received a good education in England.
How long does it take by car?
I'd be happy to discuss it.
I suppose Tom told you what time he plans to arrive.
I'm so drunk now that I'm seeing two keyboards.
That's simply wrong.
It's time for dinner.
He lived there by himself.
I thought we already did that.
I just want to say that I believe you.
I am an artist.
I'm not writing about you.
The rumors were false.
Previously people believed the earth was flat.
Is it yours?
Tom doesn't think that Mary's performance was very good.
What would get their attention?
He's a nerd.
Both Tom and Mary were absent today.
I had no idea.
I want to show you something I've been working on.
I'm not writing about you.
I just got that.
We all deserve a chance.
I will do all I can for you.
Turn it up.
You got what you wanted, didn't you?
Who sent you?
They have a large house.
You're all right.
She is a beauty.
You didn't let me finish.
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
I feel lucky to have been chosen.
Here we are.
I wanted to say hello to Tom.
She doesn't know how to ride a bike.
You've already forgotten.
I hope we have fine weather tomorrow.
I believe things will get better.
This one's crowded, so let's take the next train.
Don't let the grass grow under your feet.
I know you're not like that.
I think we can handle it.
I have been learning English these four years.
Might I express my opinion?
I'm not in a mood to go out.
He drinks to excess.
It's part of life.
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
You alone can help me.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Mama cried.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
She interrupted him while he was speaking to my father.
I'm moving, so I need boxes for my things.
He has a scraggly beard and a bum leg.
Do you approve of what she is doing?
What do you enjoy most about learning French?
Is anybody ready for dessert?
I've never seen a whale that big.
I'm just going across to the flower shop.
There's somebody at the door.
I'll give it a try.
Come join us.
We have no secrets.
We'll make our announcement on Thursday.
What're you all dressed up for?
I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow.
I usually get up at six.
We have little time to waste.
Get out of my bed.
The earthquake caused widespread damage.
This doesn't involve you.
You can go there.
You don't sound very confident.
I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.
I don't know if I still have it.
Shut up!
I just want things to be normal.
Thousands of people were there.
I find it hard to get up early on cold mornings.
That twenty-kilometer run really wiped me out.
There's a lot on the line.
They embraced.
Endorse this check.
Try to see how far you can jump.
You can't see Tom anymore.
We had a mild winter last year.
You're totally ignorant.
He is unable to do it.
You are naughty.
I dislocated my shoulder.
The burglar shut the child in the closet.
You must not touch the paintings.
I trust you.
The stakes were high.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Tom doesn't smoke.
I must learn Japanese.
You shouldn't worry about that.
Summer has ended.
That's not my fault.
My father used to say that time is money.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Start reading where you left off.
Tom and Mary think they know everything.
When did you change your address?
Try putting yourself in your mother's shoes.
You shouldn't eat any fish that come from this river.
The toilet doesn't flush properly.
Let's see.
He was so immature, he couldn't resist the temptation.

Happy is the man who is content with his lot.
The girls fainted.
Maybe it was just a nightmare.
He's very ill.
Tom and Mary often work together on Friday.
I need you now.
Please tell me what I should do first.
I don't think Tom is in Boston.
Only God can help you now.
See what I mean?
Some kids broke into Tom's house and ransacked it.
Someone left you a message.
The district attorney is unwilling to proceed due to insufficient evidence.
Now it's time to make amends.
There is no reason why he should resign.
They lied to you.
I wasn't really doing much of anything, so I decided it'd be a good idea to walk down to the cafe.
I had a breakdown.
He has two daughters, both of whom are married to doctors.
My dog has been missing for three days.
I am not sure whether I will be able to come with you.
Is it clear now?
Did she show you the picture?
You're the one who trained me.
Maybe she is coming.
What floor do you live on?
Tom is probably not busy right now.
I'm probably just being paranoid.
No one informed me of his failure.
I'm powerful.
I want a cup of iced-tea.
You're clever.
I'll stay close.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
The baby in the cradle is very pretty.
You're fascinating.
Do you have a solution?
We introduced ourselves to each other.
That's one of mine.
He came from another country.
Correct the errors if there are any.
Do I need to go right away?
I paid for the drinks.
Tom didn't even want to eat.
He had to reduce the price of his wares.
Why is she here?
I'd like to confirm my reservation for the 30th.
All of the dogs were alive.
You two had a fight today, didn't you?
Did you call him up yesterday?
I'll leave it up to you.
What do you think about it?
Let's do it!
He told the children about his adventures in Africa.
This is hard for me to believe.
The contract is in the bag, so let's go out and celebrate.
That child is full of mischief.
When did you start writing songs?
What part of Australia are you from?
How long may I borrow this notebook?
All the flowers in the garden withered.
I'd never seen anything like it.
You're very efficient.
You're the only one I trust.
We're getting tired.
You're part of the gang now.
Have you chosen a topic?
The baby's sleeping.
The boy I love doesn't love me.
I will never forgive you.
Can you repair these shoes?
Don't you think this is ridiculous?
We have to make do with what we've got.
They asked me for something to drink.

You're very clever.
I take that as a compliment.

I want to find a box for this.

They look healthy.
I'm Korean.
Tom took part in a promotional event.
I'm irreplaceable.
Can I go first?
Could you just please answer the question? We don't have all day.
You're fussy.
Let's be honest. That joke was about me.
Tom is unbelievable.
All the names are listed in alphabetical order.
Don't respond to that.
Don't you want a little excitement?
We're getting out of here.
I'll kill the both of you.
It's hardly raining at all.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
Everybody's dead.
I make you nervous, don't I?
Do you want to take that risk?

You don't have to explain.
He's intimidated by beautiful women.
I am of the opinion that this is the way to do it.
It looks good.
Go with your instinct.
Have you washed the car yet?
Did that have any special significance?
What if I asked you to stay?
How about taking a walk?
Tom got back in the car.
This is the last place I want to be right now.
I'm fine. How about you?
How do I know you didn't do it?
I like all of them.
A crowd soon gathered around the fire engine.
When did you become a teacher?
This year, the winter is mild, isn't it? It's very nice.
I just don't want to die.
Something's going on here.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.

That was a good experience.

It wasn't an easy decision.
He refused to shake hands.
We'll start whenever you are ready.

He wants one.

You work harder than anyone here.
What are you majoring in?
I don't trust strangers.

When he saw the policeman, he ran away.
We all knew it.
Who were you talking with?
I suggest that you try to get some sleep.
Red wine, please.
He was killed in the earthquake.
I'm not deaf.
How many audiobooks do you have on your mobile MP3 player?
We haven't been invited yet.
If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.
I know where they will be this afternoon.
On the same day, Apollo 11 succeeded in landing on the moon's surface.
You must teach me what you know.
Please turn up the sound.
I miss you so much.
What keeps you going?
Onions cook more quickly than potatoes.
He works for an advertising agency.
They all did it.
Why don't you sit right there on the couch?
Tom wanted me to meet him at the station.
Does this make me look fat?
Tell me what to think.
Gas was escaping from a crack in the pipe.
He presented her with a doll.
She came back ten minutes after the explosion.
I have got to go now.
I didn't hear you come in.
I like that it is soft.
I wouldn't have dreamed of it.
He complained to her about the food.
He has good reason to get very angry.
We were both drunk.
So far everything is all right.
Come along with me.
At first, the Indians were friendly.
They are the ones who want to go.
The snow is melting.
I lost my key somewhere around here.
I have a bath every day.
I know where you live.
We need to go.
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
He was fully clothed.
He went over to the other side.
I came to the conclusion that something was wrong.
Don't leave me.
I don't have an answer.
It looked awful.
After much consideration, we accepted his offer.
You're afraid that I'm right, aren't you?
We'll stand.
Get some help, will you?
You can't prove that.
The wind is cold today.
If a brain can do it, a computer can do it.
Where are you going this afternoon?
I just want to be loved.
He always works hard.
We must pay the tax.
I go for a walk every morning.
We baked it together.
I'm going back home tomorrow.
He's addicted to drugs.
We still have enough time to discuss it.
My dog is dreaming of a cat.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Do you have Saturday off?
She pretended not to hear me.
This tastes like tea.
You're the only person who shows me any respect.
Are you kidding?
What're you good at?
I wish he would write more often.
I feel very chilly.
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
We can't have all those people over for dinner.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
Tom is the strongest.
They gave him up for lost.
I'd die without you.
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
I was afraid I wouldn't have the pleasure of meeting you.
It will not last more than three minutes.
Could you explain to me why you think these rules don't apply anymore?
There are a lot of fish in this lake.
Tom's dog is well-trained.
I will badly miss you if you leave Japan.
May I charge my cell phone somewhere around here?
You can swim, can't you?
I had a hard day.
Measure twice, cut once.
There was no trace of him.
Don't turn around.
I don't feel like laughing.
Can you help me?
There is a strong bond between the brothers.
Did you take part in the discussion yesterday?
Tom lives in a poor neighborhood.
I finally understand.
You're fortunate.
He is busy preparing for the entrance examination.
She earns more than she spends.
Tom behaved badly.
No one will ever find you.
I had broken my glasses, so that I couldn't see the blackboard.
We went to Russia.
I don't care what people think.
On an island in the Seine, there is a big church called Notre Dame.
I'm not gambling anymore.
It was just a fling.
My father was no less affectionate and tender to me than my mother was.
Tom forgot.
Tom introduced me to Mary.
I believed you.
It is useless to talk to him.
You'll give me away.
I looked at the picture.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I'm not going to talk.
I'm sure he'll be as good as his word.
My colleague doctored the report.
Now drink up.
Tom learned how to do that from his grandfather.
I started crying.
He buried his head in his hands.
Don't worry about what I did.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
I have not seen you for ages.
I must go alone.
Our teacher doesn't just speak English, but French too.
He no longer lives here.
You're not looking at the whole picture.
I don't mind at all.
The plumber used many tools to fix our sink.
I'd heard you'd changed.
It's an outrage.
I made hotel reservations one month in advance.
Did I give you enough time?
How come I've never seen you here before?
Central Park is near where I work.
A lot of people are dealing with hay fever now.
Did you find a job?
Tom bought a camera on eBay.
I like what you've written.
I'm not good at telling jokes.
We've said our goodbyes.
John Adams took office in 1797.
Wait a while.
How about making me a cup of tea?
We need more data.
That's a very nice suit.
I really like French cooking.
Tell Tom I'm sorry.
No one can help.
Would you like a drink?
Who do you know in Boston?
My driver's license expires at the end of this month.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
I leave that to you.
Allow us to do our job.
Can you handle it?
It'll be all right.
Tom thinks women in America wear too much perfume.
The appendix is about 10 cm long.
It's an ecological disaster.
I was attacked.
He went over to the other side.
I said I liked it.
I feel normal.
I guess this still belongs to you.
Copy this program on your computer.
Tell Tom I still have his umbrella.
I had little to do with it.
The boy is wearing glasses.
I want to have fun.
Is Tom working?
What was it that you did there?
He is one of the American presidential candidates.
You're in big trouble.
Oil is extracted from olives.
This cloth feels like velvet.
We already gave it to you.
I want to teach you something.
It's about time we went to bed.
I wish them luck.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Few people live to be one hundred years old.
I can't bear the thought of losing you.
What kind of software does Tom usually use?
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation.
I suppose you know all about it.
Tom's impeccable manners made a big impression on Mary's parents.
They all laughed at his error.
I'm as old as you.
The horse is mine.
She handed him his jacket.
How do you know what I heard?
I have a few things to finish up before I go home.
What is it you want to tell us?
All beginnings are difficult.
It's a good way to make friends.
It isn't too late for you.
The coffee is too bitter for me to drink.
I'll show that to Tom.
I would have told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
How many of them are there?
You never should've done that.
I'm dieting.
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry.
The bell has not rung yet.
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
They will agree on that.
I had my ears checked.
These shoes are hers.
You look good in a kimono.
The company manufactures a variety of paper goods.
It is their only choice.
The cops are searching for the missing documents.
I call her pretty often.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
Japanese is harder than English.
Is eating fish good for you?
The summit nations put free trade at the top of the agenda.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
Wring those clothes well before you hang them up.
There're no guarantees.
She is a cheerful giver.
"Thanks for your help." "It was nothing."
Reservations are not required.
He was a fresh face in American politics.
I explained the process to him.
My sister was a beautiful woman.
Did I ask you?
He has started to write a novel.
I am watering the flowers.
I have some English books.
You are doing very well. Keep it up.
Fighting won't settle anything.
I wish you hadn't done that.
He assumed full responsibility for it.
I know you can make it.
He went to the store.
This is not happening.
I'm not coming back home.
As for me, I have nothing to say.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
Fortunately, the weather was good.
When's dinner served?
In Christianity, Jesus is believed to be the son of God.
He sent money to help care for her.
Who made this pie?
Your watch is ten minutes slow.
I keep a diary every day.
The travelers stayed at a seaside hotel.
Tom isn't much of a dancer.
He has big problems.
Can you get my bill ready?
Stay out of the water.
I need to know who I have to give this to.
I always wondered what that noise was.
I love watching you cook.
He is absent from school.
Do you not like them?
It doesn't matter what excuse he gives me, I can't forgive him.
I have a daughter in high school.
My parents were furious.
We were present at the dedication ceremony of the building.
I was a little put out by this.
He would like to know whether you play chess.
He's such a sweetheart.
Yesterday was Sunday.
What sort of danger are we in?
This coffee is cold.
I'd like to speak to the manager.
I'm sorry to upset your plans.
We invited him to our house.
Most of the plain, simple, everyday things he desires can be secured by people of average means.
It matters little whether he comes late or not.
No one in their right mind would walk in those woods at night.
The corpse has a gunshot wound in the chest.
I didn't vote for anyone.
My brother earns half as much money as my father.
I'm already full, thank you.
She made me so angry on the telephone that I hung up on her.
He had a bitter experience.
You're going to turn a lot of heads with that dress.
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
I arrived there too early.
I had been studying music in Boston before I returned to Japan.
Your o's look like a's.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
I wish you had told me the truth then.
He is careless about money.
Don't move or I'll shoot.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Can I use this area to raise vegetables?
They're carnations.
Do you really want to go to the party with Tom?
His name is mud.
Do you think our team will win?
Tom no longer trusts Mary.
The horse ran through the fields.
They are both good.
He betrayed you.
He is not what he used to be.
It was his first trip as a captain.
I was chosen to do that.
Would you mind if I ate a piece of this pie?
You need to be prepared.
That's just what I want to hear.
I prefer to go by bicycle.
He asked me for my phone number.
What am I supposed to do with that?
I want you to sing.
They handled it well.
He fell into a deep slumber.
I think I'd rather walk.
Where do you write?
You look upset.
If I tell her the truth, she will never forgive me.
I thought you were broke.
I'm sure we can work this out.
I want to give you enough time to do that.
I don't understand your question.
I wonder what's inside the box.
You don't seem so busy.
How do you make a box?
He knocked on the closed door.
I need a heavy coat.
Better late than never.
That's what we all want.
She could not get over her fear of the dark.
That would be very sad.
I really need to talk to you privately.
Let me pay for your coffee.
I'm checking options.
Come quickly.
Tom has long blond hair.
Have you always been so selfish?
They're almost here.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
They're the cream of the crop.
How do you write your last name?
I want you to be here.
It's already seven o'clock.
Why didn't you just take the money?
I'll tell you afterwards.
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
He'll be back in two hours. In the meantime, let's prepare dinner.
The heater is broken.
She's nice.
Tom travels a lot.
You did nothing wrong.
What's all the excitement about?
My bag was stolen.
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
They all looked happy.
The hedgehog is a small animal.
I'm not perfect.
The locking mechanism has jammed.
Tom abandoned his family.
No one's that desperate.
The projector doesn't work.
I've been asked to forward this message to you.
Half of the students are absent.
I really enjoyed last night.
Have you done all your homework?
What is wrong with that guy?
You should be proud of yourself.
I will never forget seeing you.
You can rely on him.
Who was that who answered your phone?
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
Tom asked if you'd be there.
It's easy for him to make friends.
What number bus do I take to get to Waikiki?
Over three thousand people attended the concert.
I'm getting old.
Better to extend an olive branch than launch a missile.
I'm not hungry anymore.
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
The painting is deteriorating.
Tom drank a cup of coffee.
He has brought shame upon his family.
May I borrow a ruler?
We're going to try to get you full custody.
You are my friend.
You will be paid according to the amount of work you do.
I can take a message.
What a wonderful invention!
Mary wants kids, but Tom doesn't.
After much debate, we decided to spend our holidays in Spain.
Tom isn't sure where to go.
His accent suggests he is a foreigner.
What are these people doing?
Tom doesn't think I'm interested in what he does.
You have to take a shower.
Can you believe this is really happening?
Living on a small income is hard.
Be creative.
I thought you'd be older.
I won't tolerate that anymore.
Attach a recent photograph to your application form.
Curiously, a flower bloomed on the withered up tree.
She was crying.
Stop sucking up to the teacher.
I got there ahead of time.
When will he be busy?
Do you have any aspirin?
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
How long did you stay?
Is there someone with you?
It's pretty incredible.
Are you mentally challenged?
Do we need anything else?
When I got back, I found my car missing.
The area is built up now.
He worked hard.
Girls aren't welcome.
We all have arrived.
I don't enjoy traveling in large groups.
We broke up.
My brother works in France.
Tom was stabbed to death by someone on the subway.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
I saw Tom take your keys.
She runs a dance studio.
I prefer it this way.
What do you want now?
Can you supply me with all I need?
Most souvenir shops are filled with worthless knick-knacks.
He tried to choke him.
Tom can't swim as fast as Mary.
Look, I'm really busy.
The older one grows, the weaker one's memory becomes.
I don't know anything about what happened.
Are you retired, Tom?
He has an uncontrollable temper.
I didn't take any books from the library.
Most of us were veterans.
My wife wanted to adopt a child.
Take a look.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
I'm cooperating.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
Tom tried not to cry.
It's not my business.
There's no exit.
That's a really shallow thing to say.
Come back home.
I'm not going to work.
I can't put up with her any longer.
I don't understand what's happening.
Which is mine?
You can't pay someone to sleep for you.
We bought our plane tickets two months in advance.
Tom didn't want to testify against Mary.
I heard someone calling my name.
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
A car is a must for life in the suburbs.
Would you like to visit the city?
It's possible that Tom isn't telling the truth.
I don't expect you to forgive me.
He looks suspicious.
Tom didn't even have enough money to buy a cup of coffee.
It's just the two of us.
You're very good.
She is well known in both India and China.
I wish I could be more spontaneous.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
This is a dirty movie.
The telephone doesn't work.
I have something that belongs to you. Why don't you come over and pick it up?
Write in ink.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Don't worry about it, OK?
I don't carry cash anymore.
They had a spat yesterday.
I think you should see this.
What do you think of these shoes?
Did I ask your opinion?
I want you to take this with you.
I really like that car.
It is difficult to satisfy everyone.
Where's the source of this river?
We're not turning back.
How did you get here so fast?
Will you lend me your dictionary?
Say which one you would like.
The tree fell down.
Tom came too late.
We don't have to go.
Living here isn't easy.
I turned it off.
What if he fails?
Just keep moving.
He crossed the river.
I want everyone to bring their children.
I've worked as a waiter for three years.
I never told anybody about it, I swear.
Please think it over and let me know your decision.
Let's call it a day.
How about sleeping at home?
No students were absent.
What's the longest word in French?
I can't blame Tom for hating me.
You're Germans, aren't you?
Write to him right away.
Who broke this?
The house was deserted.
He doesn't look happy to see us.
He exchanged seats with the next person.
Extension 45, please.
I'm busy.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
I think he's happy.
She was advised by him to stop smoking.
How much is this ring worth?
They changed it very recently.
Don't you speak French?
I haven't really made up my mind yet.
We're in kind of a hurry.
The orange left a strange taste in my mouth.
I didn't graduate.
You could've been hurt.
Opinions are not facts.
Do you think anyone can see us?
She assured him that everything was OK.
She likes to listen to music.
I like children.
I'm quite happy.
You can make it.
Sometimes I wonder whether or not I made the right decision.
Be friendly.
She committed a crime.
Tom is very handsome.
He was tired, but he kept on working.
Mozart wrote brilliant, complex musical compositions as easily as you or I would write a letter.
I refuse to give up on this.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
I thought I heard you.
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
Is there anything I can do for you?
The plane took off at exactly ten o'clock.
We could wait.
My sister and I went to the castle.
We need to come to an agreement.
Is there space for one more person?
That rock band gives me a headache.
Let me know your address.
The doctor ordered me to stay in bed.
You have to stay fit.
He let us go.
Christmas is rapidly approaching.
He got across the river.
I couldn't figure out how to open the door.
Do you care for classical music?
Which season do you like the best?
After that incident, he never drank again.
Don't you smell something burning in the kitchen?
You're creative.
How much do I owe you for the cup of coffee?
That's all for now.
Can we go fishing?
He gives me a bad time, as he always does.
This coffee is too hot for me to drink.
I feel a lot better now.
I can't go to the restaurant with you tonight.
I will come tomorrow without fail.
When does the restaurant open?
Why do I even care?
That was fun, wasn't it?
You have only to ask for it.
The Union soldiers fought fiercely.
I wish I were as young as you.
How could it be?
I don't know what I was expecting.
I did not expect it to be that big.
Tom says he'll be a bit late.
I would prefer that you didn't submit this.
I was thrown off guard.
All the doors of the house were closed.
How did you get them?
If God is with us, then who is against us?
You must be cautious.
I am hanging up my shirts.
I can't do this job without you.
The apple trees blossomed early this year.
Do you think I'm ugly?
I'm in trouble now.
The hunter shot a fox.
It is dark in that room.
He told us he had gone through many hardships.
He whispered sweet nothings into her ear.
They danced all night long.
I thought there was somebody in the room.
Can you persuade him to join our club?
She goes to school on foot.
Tom has forgotten how to do it.
I finally caught up with my friends.
I studied hard so that I could pass the examination.
I like spring the best.
Tom likes to work in the garden before going to work.
Let me know as soon as he comes.
Don't you have any good news?
The police accused her of texting while driving.
They have just arrived.
Someone might see us.
Too many sweets make you fat.
I accompanied her on the piano.
I worked hard.
I want my bicycle back.
At the end of a working day, everybody is in a hurry to get home.
It's all your own fault.
It failed.
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
He is a very imaginative writer.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
Do you play in a band?
Tom can't be far away.
I lead a busy life.
You should start as early as possible.
You can't just keep throwing your money away on this kind of thing.
Where could they be?
Can I open my eyes now?
You're early.
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
Whether he agrees or not, we won't change our plans.
The day is almost over.
I gave you an extra hour and you still didn't finish the job.
I think that recording is important.
What is the address of the new bookshop?
Don't be so rough on yourself.
I want to know what that is.
She likes going to the library.
I think I can fix this.
See that this never happens again.
The explorers finally reached their goal.
He spoke with a typical Texan drawl.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to live.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
Too much of anything is bad, but too much good whiskey is barely enough.
That's pretty impressive.
I just got here a few hours ago.
They're not coming.
All of them will get a prize.
He thought it over and decided not to go.
Are you going to leave?
He participated in the debate.
He insisted that I join him.
I invited my neighbor to breakfast.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
She gave me these old coins.
How many kids do you have?
I'm your boyfriend, aren't I?
I'm married now.
You may bring whoever you like.
Quality is more important than quantity.
I'm not quite sure.
She ignored him almost all day.
Tastes in music vary from person to person.
This is reality.
How do you want to handle it?
A person who won't read has no advantage over one who can't read.
I'm not thirsty right now.
Let's find Tom before Mary does.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
I need to get something done very quickly.
Stay right there.
I'll guide you.
Tom's a great guy to hang out with.
Easy does it.
I have a terrible toothache.
You gave me your word.
Tom is almost ready to go.
I go right home after work.
I realized what was happening.
I can never stay angry at Tom for very long.
How's your old lady doing?
They caught him stealing.
What are you doing?
That'll never fly.
She is terrible at cooking.
She played a sonata.
Reading books will make you smarter.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Would you like go out for a drink after work?
This is not a game.
Do you know who they are?
What do you want me to do about it?
She described him as handsome.
Tom's sweating.
That is not a tiger.
Don't move or I'll shoot.
It's time to get down to business.
He's their only child.
It was shorter than she expected.
Nothing is as important as peace.
Finally, the bell rang.
He held out his hand to me.
I know a lot about it.
If you rest, you will be back on your feet again soon.
I owe you a lot.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
Does that suit you?
What are you lining up for?
This desk is a little too low for me.
I always try to tell the truth.
They were swimming.
He sent me a letter saying that he could not see me.
Are you lying to me?
I have been studying French four years now.
We're going to have to work together.
I rescued you.
He is too sensitive.
Do you mean you're giving up?
There was a bridge across each river.
He isn't perfect.
All the people who go to church believe in God.
I can't see anything with my right eye.
We'll help.
Let's take a short cut.
The soldiers guarded the bridge.
I must continue.
When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person.
That cloud looks like a rabbit to me.
Your method is different from mine.
Today is tomorrow's yesterday.
There is an urgent need for good legal advice.
I promised.
I'm asking you for your help.
He lost his balance and fell off the ladder.
Have you asked if they want one?
You should've gotten up earlier.
I'm in pain every minute of every day.
I missed you.
I have to get up quite early tomorrow.
We have a lot of English books in the library.
Even with his glasses, he doesn't see very well.
He speaks in his sleep.
The bullet found its mark.
I'm thrilled.
You're famous.
I can dance.
I wish I could see you.
You're not my friend.
She didn't like him.
What do you do for a living?
I didn't shoot anyone.
What're you doing?
Stay away from that place.
Please remain seated for a few minutes.
Give me your phone.
I feel bad about it.
You're not cooperating.
Her friends waited for her by the gate.
New blankets were distributed to the poor.
Nothing happened after all.
I anticipated his question.
The national debt has trebled in the last ten years.
I got one for Christmas.
What an exciting game!
She talked to the chairperson.
I'm your sister.
I'm going to buy a new car.
She does not like sushi.
To be happy, you should spend time with someone you love.
When will they give a concert?
I don't know if I want to do that.
Your bike is better than mine.
If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me.
I still have to try.
His wife is one of my friends.
I hope this isn't a dream.
I'm afraid we're out of time.
He was in the hot seat.
I've got a good idea.
Apples grow on trees.
He's coming closer.
He is the most obstinate child I have ever seen.
Both sisters are very beautiful.
He gave her a peck on the cheek.
If I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
I find you attractive.
I sold it for ten dollars.
I felt left out.
Can you pitch?
Those houses are 500 years old.
Tom just returned from Boston.
I didn't want to be presumptuous.
Reaction is not always the best course of action.
Do you have any money?
Tom Jackson is my favorite writer.
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
I live in Tahiti.
I don't think that he's right.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know.
Don't touch my car.
More than 3,000 people were at the concert.
I appreciate you stopping by.
I noticed that he had stopped.
What you need is a friend.
I study from eight to eleven.
You're probably thirsty.
I broke my right leg.
Don't worry. Everything's OK.
I can't tell you how much I've looked forward to this moment.
How are you?
He broke the law.
He was in prison on a charge of robbery.

Tell Mary I love her.
They all died.
My brother is stronger than me.
He is late.
I know your time is valuable, but could I ask you just one question?
No one's allowed in.
All the signs are that she is getting better.
We're done.
I might have done well on yesterday's test, but I do not know the results yet.
She was ready to give him back all his money.
Did I hear you right?
She is anxious about her father's health.
Who's going to drive me to the airport?

The production of vegetables is growing in our area.
You really should buy a new car.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
I saw you.
I can't go to work in these clothes.
It's a matter of priorities.
You can wait here.
I can't believe you really want to do that.
Would Tom like that?
I like to sing.
I don't think I can do it.
Can Tom read and write Japanese?
We're reliable.
Most of the policemen lost their jobs.
It's for you to decide.
No one knows anything.
He is tall and strong.
He appealed to us for help.
The whole world is watching.
You should always save money for a rainy day.
Show me what you have hidden behind your back.
She risked her life to save him.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
What is going on?
This is my book.
I'm glad I hired you.
The nurses are very nice.
You may have that opportunity.
We couldn't go out because of the heavy rain.
She attacked him with a pair of scissors.
You should apologize to him for coming late.
Take care and have a nice day.
I think I'm getting sick.
You could help me.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
You can sit down now.
I think Tom could learn a lot from you.
You can count on him.
I already did it.
I'm full.
I hate that book.
You're really awesome.
You have no evidence.
I wish today were Friday.
Give me a final answer.
Did you watch TV yesterday?
He is a good doctor.
I don't know why I even bother anymore.
I am amazed at your audacity.

Draw a picture of yourself.
Nothing could sway his conviction.
I really wish I could believe you.
My father came home at nine.
You were terrified, weren't you?
I wish my girlfriend would spend more time with me.
Could I borrow your car?
Can I go now?
At any rate, we can't change the schedule.
Everything went black.
Can you tell me what Tom said?
That's not what you want to do.
Stock prices fell quickly.
She's about the same age as I am.
You don't seem very sure.
Are you deaf?
Where are you bound?
Tom doesn't want you to share this information with anyone.
The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
We have mutual friends.
I missed the point of the joke.
The intersection where the accident happened is near here.
I'm not particularly impressed.
Give him a hug.
Stop being cruel.
He took his book.
There's no danger.
Tom came.
I have a tight schedule.
Can this wait until next week?
Do you mind if I go back to sleep now?
They all knew.
I'm getting hungry.
I didn't do what I was told to do.
The size of the universe is unimaginable.
I'd like to find somebody to take care of my children.
You are no longer welcome here.
Tom forgot the keys on the table.
Come on! We're going to be late.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
Will he ever come back?
I don't remember actually deciding to do that.
Would you care to join us?
I want you to know how sorry I am.
Watch me.
Are you certain?
That's not bad.
They looked very happy.
Tom met Mary on his way to school.
Tom isn't busy right now.
I had only one drink.
That company produces microchips.
The committee members are all present.
Why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
Tom just got back to Boston today.
I'm doing pretty well.
I had the same problem when I was your age.
He goes to the library to read books.
Are you dating anyone?
I was disqualified.
He is sure to pass the exam if he studies at this rate.
Let me put this in perspective for you.
You're safe now.
Don't touch anything without asking.
I relied on him.
She teaches English.
How's your business going?
Life as it is is very uninteresting to him.
I've never seen anything like this.
Did I hurt your feelings?
I'll graduate this year, I hope.
It was a pretty amazing experience.
He stuck his pencil behind his ear.
How can we learn the truth?
I don't even have a boyfriend.
There is a small garden in front of my house.
You came at just the right time.
You like everyone.
Tom is really motivated.
We are traveling on a tight budget.
The walls were painted light brown.
I have nothing to do with the affair.
I was right all along.
She moved my clothes.
I can't believe I let you talk me into volunteering.
Thank you for your present.
I think they saw you.
The opera starts at seven.
They acted on the information.
We will employ a man who can speak English.
Tom is very kind to us.
How are you going to do that?
Try it again.
That was awesome.
What do you plan on doing with the money?
Can I tell you something very personal?
He pretended not to be listening.
I'm on my way to visit a friend in the hospital.
I was forced to go.
You're taller than I am.
I'd have waited for you.
The rain stopped us from being able to play tennis outside.
Didn't you go out?
Do you have any further questions?
Let's move the bed.
I left my umbrella on the bus.
The rescuers searched the surroundings in hopes of finding the child.
I'm falling in love with you.
I reckon you should do it.
Even if it rains, I'll go swimming tomorrow.
Nobody can surpass him.
You're very astute.
I don't want people to hate me.
I have poor eyesight.
My doctor told me to put the eyedrops in my eyes three times a day.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
I messed up.
Tell me where you went.
You won't need those.
People always ask me why I do what I do.
I'd like you to be more punctual.
You must be cautious.
I have orders.
What's it look like?
Do you guys want to read what I wrote?
He has to study hard.

Give me back my hat.
Do they have money?
He owes his success only to good luck.
I hope that he will succeed.

I want to come.
I just want you all to know you can depend on me.
Do you feel like resting?
He has an eye for antiques.
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
I like rock.
I have some money with me.
You may as well go yourself.
Your story is hard to believe.
He promised to write every day.
Do I look busy to you?
Don't lose sleep over that.
Tie your shoe.
Do I need a reason?
I was deeply impressed with his courage.
"Thank you for your help." "It's my pleasure."
Where are your friends going?
I wish I had a reason not to stay.
I know they'll all want to help you.
How good are you?
You should be proud of yourself.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
We have to do better next time.
Tom says you've never been to Boston.
The storm destroyed the whole town.
I'm on my way home from work.
You must do exactly as I tell you.
I'm glad you're here with me.
Is everybody OK?
I'll keep that book for myself.
We're getting close.
Don't screw it up!

I didn't want to bug you.
I want you to do something about it right away.

I've never eaten Chinese food before.
This climate is having a bad effect on your health.
He visited his hometown for the first time in ten years.
You're stupid to trust him.

You can swim, but I can't swim.
I thought they'd heard us.

You've been selected.
She introduced herself to the people who were there.
He told me he would go to Venice.
This is most unfortunate.
That has nothing to do with him.

You must do it quickly.
I appreciate your support.

I'm always happy.
Will you send it by mail?
You didn't tell me Tom smoked.
He was the first to help him.
What do you think of Mary's new dress?
I loved that movie when I was a kid.
We're here to protect you.
That's what's driving me crazy.
How's your wife?
Let me check.
Stop playing hard to get.
Isn't that what I said?
Can you fix this or should I call a plumber?
Look it up.
Are you a registered voter?
The sound of a gunshot echoed across the canyon.
God made the universe.
Things might've turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
There's no limit.
Trust me on that.
What language are you speaking?
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I wonder if you understand.
I've been given permission to inspect this equipment.
What a colossal waste of time!
It is obvious that that is a lie.
I work in a flower shop.
He has many talents.
Is there enough gravy?
I have completely recovered.
You should know better.
Are you free for lunch?
After we finish digging the trench, planting the flowers will be easy.
I doubt the truth of the report.
Save me some ice cream.
You have no right to interfere in other people's affairs.
The old man tripped over his own feet.
I know you considered me a close friend.
I used to weigh seventy kilos.
Keep your hands off my bicycle.
A rope was thrown into the water.
He used his umbrella as a weapon.
My back still hurts.
Can I use a credit card for payment?
I hope it was worth it.
Have you seen my car keys?
I hope this data will be useful to you.
You're overconfident.
He will leave for the station an hour before the train leaves.
I wonder why we have ear lobes.
The storm prevented us from going out.
It was a warm day.
Don't trust him no matter what he says.
Could you please take care of my dog while I'm in Boston?
Since it stopped raining, he went out for a walk.
Tom and Mary are unbeatable at tennis.
Why don't you go help Tom?
Do you have shoes and socks?
I pointed at him.
Tom changed jobs.
You are not at all wrong.
Who was this picture painted by?
Don't use too much water.
I thought you said you worked here.
Hurry up, or we'll miss the train.
I just do what I can do.
Look! Two boys are fighting.
You're free.
We want you to be more careful next time.
I heard him humming in the shower.
Why was I the only one asking questions?
I don't like this weather.
Teachers often buy school supplies with their own money.
Some were under the impression that the judges had not chosen wisely.
It's bad for you.
I sat at the front in order to hear the lecture clearly.
He's an Italian teacher.
He was too drunk to drive home.
What do you plan to do?
They have no more wine.
Both sisters are very beautiful.
It is something my mother made.
We had to react quickly.
I saw his car make a turn to the right.
He might change his mind.
Stay out of it.
I'll have to go there tomorrow.
I got nauseous.
I thought it was funny.
They will have to cut down their expenses.
I've never gotten a speeding ticket.
This is for you.
My sister became a college student.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
The weather remained rainy.
I will do anything but that.
Can we go?
He is tired of reading.
I contributed.
I'm your friend.
It's convenient for me to see you at ten tonight.
If you help me, I'll try it again.
We have overlooked this important fact.
Do you remember what she said?
You don't speak English, do you?
Maybe I'll call you.
I'm the one who brought the subject up.
Why do you study French?
How much did that cost?
The real heroes are us.
Tom is totally ignoring me.
Continue digging.
She recognized him immediately.
A river runs down through the valley.
We can save a little time if we do what Tom suggests.
How do you stand this heat?
You can do that right now.
I just don't want any of these.
I love the way you kiss.
You weren't serious, were you?
I have to stay here.
She advised him to do more exercise.
I never thought about it before.
What shall I do with it?
Regardless what you say, I don't believe you.
A violent thought instantly brings violent bodily movements.
That could take days.
Would you like to hang out with us?
Here's the bill.
He let his books fall to the floor.
I can't get in.
It was determined that the plane crashed due to pilot error.
They slept in the same bed.
Come here by ten at the latest.
Without you, life is awful.
I want to hear you play the piano.
Tom tried to conceal the truth.
It's no problem.
I knew there was something different about you.
To tell the truth, I'm tired of violent movies.
I bought a pen for your birthday present.
We're quite certain of that.
Run for it!
I have to do what's right.
Tom often walks to school.
You didn't give me the correct change.
I'm already in trouble.
I want to talk to you, Tom.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
You're a nervous wreck.
What do you spend most of your time on the computer doing?
You're always saying that.
I tried to save you.
Tom takes good care of the birds.
Stay out of the rain.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
There is a clock on the wall.
Is this your bicycle?
You make it look easy.
That store no longer sells cosmetics.
She told him that her father had died.
That's a huge organ.
This is what'll happen.
I got the book back from him.
She was watching the dead leaves fall.
Can you break a 1,000 yen bill?
How are we going to get there?
She plays Bach.
I'll start with a beer.
She wants to marry a millionaire.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
He's under the chair.
I'm just tired.
I know what they'll want me to do.
He had a queer expression on his face.
I don't think I can do anything else.
Where exactly did you go?
I've already checked on that.
How did you get to know him?
Did you ask Tom why?
We have other things to do.
Tom asked the waitress for the wine list.
Forward this to everyone you know.
The machine was too complicated for us to find out the cause of the trouble.
I don't know which of you came first.
Not having a telephone is an inconvenience.
I'll be discreet.
Don't forget to mail this letter.
How many of us were there?
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
I realized I wasn't ready.
The ice will crack beneath our weight.
What does this image make you think of?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I fell in love with someone my parents didn't like.
I thought you were asleep.
I hate to complain.
She deliberately exposed him to danger.
Everyone agreed.
I hope you'll find this office satisfactory.
He wants to meet you.
Nothing is going to happen.
It's time to go.
I've already finished reading this book.
This house is very small.
I really think you should come.
I want to start over.
I'm a little busy.
I knew this would be hard for you.
You like her, don't you?
They knew how much danger they were in.
They tried a third time.
He was never to see his homeland again.
I thought you'd be grateful.
I wrote that.
How's your little sister?
I have plenty of ideas.
He looks old for his age.
You're demented.
We're tempting fate.
We're deluding ourselves.
Do you have any trouble with that?
I guess we were happy.
We need to add some statistics to the PowerPoint.
The rain has let up, so we can begin.
Tom doesn't want Mary to touch him.
The way Tom drives, he's going to have an accident sooner or later.
He advised me not to smoke.
Everybody had a hard time.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
Terrific!
That's probably true.
I will never tell a lie from now on.
She's much better today.
I missed my flight.
Why don't you tell me what to do?
That is what we want to know.
Can you hear us?
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
I confessed my sin.
Can I say this one last time?
I thought Tom was with you.
He applied for the job and got it.
The girls giggled.
I have a lot of books.
I don't blame you for doing that.
I will sue you.
How's the project going?
We were not invited to the party.
He's got the flu.
She wept bitterly.
Are we just friends?
We'll soon find out.
I got up early in the morning.
Am I supposed to believe any of that?
My mother is busy cooking dinner.
She was almost hit by a car.
Are you on holiday?
How old are your kids?
Please read between the lines.
I prefer plain materials.
Since it was so hot, we went swimming.
I had my licence renewed a week ago.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
I'll get back to you.
I really don't have time for this.
I'm sleepy, so I am leaving now.
A lot of tourists invaded the island.
I made you a pair of mittens.
Are you American?
The fugitive made a run for the border.
My phone rang again.
What a beautiful sunset.
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
Are you really that ignorant?
They can't believe it.
I remember returning the book to the library.
He gave me a good piece of advice.
She raced him down the hill.
You need to sleep.
He is likely to win the game.
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer.
Roll up your sleeves and get to work.
You can't blame this on us.
He ran so he would get there on time.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
He got the first prize.
She would often come late for school.
It has rained since yesterday.
That man is a soldier.
Please say the alphabet in reverse.
The thieves divvied up the proceeds from their heist.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
You could search the world over and never find another woman more beautiful than Mary.
You're careless.
Perhaps you can beat me.
She stopped our fighting.
Buy me a drink.
I thought it might be of some use.
He goes to sleep with the lights left on.
Can you make sense of what the writer is saying?
I'll be watching you.
I just want to be different.
She turned off the radio.
I haven't tried doing it that way.
"I don't have time to spend with my kids." "You should make time."
Can you tell me what this is?
Don't forget to write the zip code.
He became ever more famous as a critic.
My mother hates writing letters.
Are you telling me that I can't go?
He began to look for a job.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm eating.
The whale is a very large mammal which lives in the sea.
I could rip you apart with my bare hands.
It was surprising that she said that.
I wasn't invited.
No one knew what to do.
Do you have any cash?
She absolutely trounces me whenever we play Scrabble.
Tell me about the incident.
I don't like studying.
They are actors.
They forgot to wake me up.
We're out of ammo.
Would you like to come to my party?
How many of your students are here?
He has retired, but he is still an actual leader.
You can invite other people.
I woke up at five this morning.
Tom wondered when Mary had bought the milk that was in the refrigerator.
What was it that you gave him?
Don't you think it's strange that he's not here?
I couldn't enter because the door was closed.
He doesn't yet know the truth.
Peace talks will begin next week.
You don't want to get married either, right?
Can they give you something for that?
I can't wait.
I feel like I could cry.
My father failed in business.
I have just finished eating lunch.
What time is your curfew?
Tom is wiser than me.
This breaks my heart.
Don't back away.
Now it's your turn.
Where do you think we came from?
He is a nice person, to be sure, but not very clever.
The athletic meet was postponed due to rain.
Why are you out of breath?
He is proud of his collection.
Does anyone have a picture of this?
How do you access the Internet?
What day is it today?
Now that you are eighteen, you can get a driver's license.
I guess I shouldn't complain.
I cleared the table.
You're not very good.
We will have some visitors one of these days.
You are very insensitive.
There's no telling what he'll do next.
Our daughter burned her finger with a match.
We're enjoying ourselves.
You're a good journalist.
I regret saying that.
Let me open it by myself.
Have you ever dyed your hair?
I'm still suffering from jet lag.
No one is too old to learn.
This train runs between Tokyo and Osaka.
Did you get fired from your last job?
He has been the chief of his tribe for 35 years.
I want to know what it is.
Is everything all right?
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Don't go near the dog.
Why are you flinching?
I explained to the host that I had been delayed by a traffic jam.
I'm just trying to be friendly.
The village needs your help.
What would you do in my place?
He's bulked up quite a bit since he's been going to the gym.
I want to sort this out once and for all.
I tossed and turned all night.
In the end, they approved the proposal.
That is the same umbrella as I found on the bus.
Is everybody having a good time?
We must do away with violence.
I managed to catch the last train.
It seems logical to me.
I can't do it alone.
What's the meaning of life?
Turn the hose off.
You don't have to do it immediately.
I tried to warn you.
I didn't go to school last Monday.
You haven't eaten anything yet, have you?
All you have to do is wash the dishes.
One of the students didn’t come today.
Pull the rope tight.
I don't like silence.
Make a decision.
This is theirs.
I wonder if dinner is ready.
Have you finished your homework yet?
I want a book to read on the train.
He can drive a car.
It'll be easy to find someone to rent this house.
I'm a little behind schedule.
I saw you.
Please eat some cake.
Is he afraid of death?
I have a new red car.
Stop being so nice to me.
A rack of lamb makes a great meal.
Unfortunately, she didn't come.
How do you know that'll happen?
You're not telling the truth.
Correct the underlined words.
He cannot write his own name.
I had to refuse her offer.
He never got a holiday.
I wish I knew what it was.
When did that happen?
He mentioned it.
The dog sniffed her luggage.
Why did you lie to me?
We all know what happened here.
I think I look fat in these jeans.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
We enjoyed playing chess last night.
I may know someone who can help you.
I really am glad you're here.
Don't make me answer that question.
This chair is very comfortable.
I'm armed.
Work harder if you plan to succeed.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
Kyoto was the former capital of Japan.
He has a sharp tongue.
She succeeded in getting what she wanted.
How many people are in your crew?
I'm not sure of anything.
I respect your opinion.
I don't know that word.
Just tell him the truth.
I want to be pampered.
Did she have a hard time?
This camera is cheap.
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?
They formed a swim team.
The criminal escaped from the prison.
There was a food fight in the cafeteria.
This isn't your fault, Tom.
Don't rush.
I tried to escape.
We broke up.
I don't want you to go home.
Speaking English is useful.
You don't get it, do you?
The noise was deafening.
Timing is everything.
I'm afraid of dogs.
She had white shoes on.
Normally, we eat three times a day.
I can't believe you eat that stuff.
Tom tried to drink his problems away.
Where is the bus stop for the museum?
All of a sudden, it began raining.
China is the largest country in Asia.
When will you leave?
It looks nice.
You're too suspicious about everything.
Tom parked his car behind the building.
We want to talk to you.
That umbrella is Tom's.
I always arrive a little ahead of time.
I like the kind of music that Tom plays.
You're precise.
Let me read you something.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
I don't see the appeal.
They made her go.
Do whatever it takes.
This work is simple enough for a child to do.
She plays tennis very well.
I washed my feet.
Were they good?
Don't take your eyes off Tom.
She cooks well.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to kick you.
What's happening here?
Hawaii is a popular tourist resort.
Do both Tom and Mary understand French?
This medicine will do you good.
He is proud that his father was a famous scientist.
He was accused of murder.
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.
We should be proud of ourselves.
It was Tom that told me this story.
It was a resounding success.
I'd like to know the truth.
Are you going to buy the car?
You've bought more stamps than necessary.
They weren't invited.
I know now what we have to do.
I don't know which to choose.
It may well rain before tonight.
I think you must be getting tired.
I don't care what you do with it.
It was kind of you to help me.
I've finished all except the last page.
They can't get out.
Believe it or not, I went skydiving.
I drank a lot and can't remember much of what happened last night.
Does he have a dog?
I didn't get the job.
Take as long as you need.
He asked a favor of me.
It's not that different.
They said you were fired.
We can't just ignore this problem.
What is he hiding?
You bought it from Tom, didn't you?
The teacher recommended that I read Shakespeare.
Thank you for inviting me to dinner.
Why did they hire you?
Put your glasses on.
Something is different.
I fed the dog.
Come here right now.
Everyone likes her.
Don't keep me waiting here like this.
Did you think of that?
I respect you and your opinions.
Those pants are a little too tight in the waist.
I'd like to get the meeting started.
I'd been on my own all week and was starving for conversation.
I want you to be prepared.
Tokyo is bigger than Yokohama.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
Tom must be tired.
I don't do drugs.
This book is interesting.
She handed me a postcard.
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
What's your impression of the United States?
Did you see that car?
I can't believe we're going to lose.
I bought an electric car.
Just do your job.
She came near to me.
I caught a cold and was in bed yesterday.
Someone should talk to him and tell him what's what.
I'd like to have a room with a nice view.
I think you need some sleep.
I went inside.
They are both good.
She brought up the three children alone.
You should go now.
The protesters set many cars on fire.
I knew it was just a misunderstanding.
I hate this uniform.
I see Tom.
What did you say your name was?
Come on, try again.
Tom was upset.
I haven't had the honor of meeting him.
The goods were transported by ship.
I'll read it.
English is a means of communication.
The castle might be haunted.
The papers got blown away.
We're working at the moment.
Where are the meters?
He isn't married.
Mary wants both a career and a family.
We are worried about you.
We're going to discuss the problem tomorrow.
How many sisters do you have?
My wife is a good manager.
I stopped smoking and drinking.
It is fine today.
The dog bit the man.
I've been accused of murder.
Don't be so outraged.
Did you have any trouble?
Do I have to pay you?
It's a piece of cake.
I decided not to eat.
I hope Tom knows what he's doing.
I felt cheated.
Don't play baseball here.
I can't stand his behavior anymore.
The tree was felled with one hard blow of his ax.
He gave back all the money he had borrowed.
I appreciate your patience.
I'm out of shape.
Tom didn't even know how to say "thank you" in French.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
He laughed nervously.
I think we both know why I'm here.
It was not clear what she said.
Is this fake?
Are you about done?
That looks like it would be fun to do.
Don't make me do it again.
You're such a liar.
Bears like to scratch their back on tree bark.
I have to dress up.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
Tom sat in the darkness.
I was disappointed with his speech.
He is acquainted with the custom.
The soldiers laughed.
Don't you remember anything?
I feel like going out today.
That's a really wonderful plan.
I am so exhausted!
He can help you out.
We spent hours trying to solve the problem.
Today, I went to the doctor's.
She was about to leave.
It's good to see you again.
Is that what you want?
Tom said he didn't know the answer.
Nobody is perfect.
The storm caused a power outage.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Anyone can do it if they try.
They basked in the sun.
I can't go with you.
If you hurry, you can make it.
Look at the size of that thing!
Everyone waited.
A good lie is easier to believe than the truth.
Let's be best friends forever.
Just do everything Tom tells you to do.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Who is the man sitting at the other end of the table?
Hello, girls.
Everybody wants permanent peace.
The meeting was closed.
The company announced hundreds of layoffs.
All people can become friends, even if their languages and customs are different.
It was sweet of you to do this for us.
The rich are getting richer.
Don't trust what he says.
Let's play cards.
May I see your passport?
You are wrong.
She's nice to me.
Tom wants revenge.
Give me an example.
My mother is preparing dinner.
He tried to solve the problem, but had no luck.
Worms are sometimes beneficial to soil.
We nearly starved.
Where does this doodad go?
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
He stubbed out his cigar in the ashtray and stood up to leave.
Take care not to catch a cold.
I met him once.
It's my job.
I can't believe you actually did that.
There are some differences between British English and American English.
Please tell me what you know about it.
I want to help you, Tom.
Do you want sugar in your coffee?
Have you ever been there?
They won't help us.
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.
I don't like the way he speaks to me.
I regret kissing you.
Sorry, but it all came about so suddenly that I haven't got a handle on the situation yet.
Give me a piece of paper.
Something was wrong.
Do you feel like going out for a walk?
Out of sight, out of mind.
Take a little nap on the sofa.
Visit us tomorrow.
You don't scare me.
Did I hurt you?
He parties too much.
I saw him looking at me.
You don't look very comfortable.
It'll be tricky.
Will you dance with me?
Smoking is prohibited.
Oh, don't be like that.
Tom doesn't want to eat lunch now.
The stakes are high.
I'm not finished with him.
She lives with him.
She looks familiar.
Where's everybody else?
Everybody blames you.
I sold it for ten dollars.
She looked away.
I have a sharp pain here.
My daughter is often sick.
I like your place.
I didn't go.
They found out.
I owe him a debt.
What else do you have?
It's very kind of you.
Do you know whose car that is?
They didn't ask that.
I need to be alone.
There are few mistakes in your report.
Hurry up and you can still catch your train.
Tom wants Mary's approval.
He felt very lonely.
I borrow money.
He's a hunk.
Why are you guys so angry?
Just do what you've got to do.
She married a sailor.
Don't get so carried away.
What do they want us to do?
It is not easy to understand why you want to leave.
Play that song again.
I saw Tom hitting Mary.
I wonder if Tom is trying to kill me.
It is no use complaining.
Tom ignored our advice.
I was lucky.
May I open a can?
We have not yet begun to fight.
Business is so slow these days.
She refused to take the money.
How would you like your steak cooked?
"What were you two talking about?" "Nothing."
I never expected that to happen.
I have many friends who speak fluently, but still don't sound like native speakers.
This is my sister.
He grows vegetables in his garden.
We're studying Chinese.
This isn't a party.
This is classified.
Stop being so nice to me.
He's very skeptical.
Why don't you sing for us?
He maintained that he was innocent.
Advice is like salt.
This doesn't make sense to me either.
I feel sorry for you.
When did all this happen?
My daughter was cheated.
What do you think you'll do with your life?
Tom pulled out a pencil.
Please be polite.
This dress suits you well.
Did he show you the picture?
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
The exhibition was very impressive.
"May I help you?" "Yes, I'm looking for a dress."
I want you to talk to me.
There are no customers.
I'm still not sure.
Let me check your ticket.
I had no idea who she was.
I plan on being there in person.
I'm normal.
Don't hurt anybody else.
Tom wasn't violent.
He acquired French quickly.
If you do that, everyone's going to hate you.
I'll get you.
Are you responsible for this mess?
Are we leaving soon?
I ran as fast as I could to catch the train.
It was believed that the earth was flat.
Tom is a singer-songwriter.
They didn't find the bomb.
Keep your eye on the ball.
I was pleasantly surprised.
I really like you.
You're cuter than Mary.
I'm not going, and that's that.
Does anybody here have a corkscrew?
This paint comes off easily.
I know why you did it.
I left some stuff I need in the car.
We're all in the same boat.
It looks like she's got a lot of friends.
You could come and live with me.
I have no idea of what to expect.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
It'll be very hot tomorrow.
I had a job when I was your age.
I told you I'm not drunk.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
It doesn't look too hard.
We're less than halfway to the top of the mountain. Are you already tired?
I sat behind a very tall person at the theater.
Bartender, I'd like to have a drink.
Take good care of yourself.
I have an invitation.
You're so predictable.
You're the one who trained me.
Are you all nuts?
There was no one else on the road.
Tom wanted Mary to sign his yearbook.
I want this room cleaned.
You've still got all your life in front of you.
Let's see if Tom can help us.
It rained all day.
I think I know who did it.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
He appeared on TV last night.
I haven't been back here since that unfortunate incident.
I love both cats and dogs.
Who wants this?
Do you recycle?
I'm going to Paris in the fall.
Where is Mary?
Tom has been friendly to me.
My mother died during my absence.
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.
I saw them.
Are you happy in your house?
The school is closed.
The sisters hate each other.
That's too much!
You're old enough to know better.
It was a judgment call.
Raise your hand if you have a question.
You must make up for the loss.
He's about the same age as you are.
I wish I had been there with you.

You must study more.
That's him at the window.
You run very fast.
He writes to his mother every now and then.
I suggest you cooperate.
Are you leaving now?
You're not wearing any pants.
Trust me on that.
She put her head out of the window.
We hit it off right off the bat.

What if you're wrong?
At the next intersection, take a right.
I got out of the car at 40th Street.
I'm worried about the future.

That country has a trade surplus. It exports more than it imports.
Everyone is looking at Tom.
He felt sad because he lost his father.
Tom must've seen it.
You're no friend of mine.
Do you really mean it?
They never did an autopsy.
I really wish I didn't have to go to that meeting this afternoon.
Tom told me to be more careful.
I can only tell you what I know.

Let's go this way.
Maybe you were right.
She and I have about the same number of stamps.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
It rained heavily.
It's always been like that.
I think we need to postpone the meeting.
Like a good wine, he improves with age.
She calls him every night and talks for at least an hour.
May I be of help in any way?
Will it fit?
Give it to me straight.
Will you please wait on me, miss?

As far as I know, he is an honest man.
He sprained his ankle.
She didn't try to translate the letter.
I didn't say you were here.
Tom knows almost nothing about Mary.
You're not allowed to eat those.
What do I call you?
How did we get to this point?
She is busy at present and can't speak to you.
I didn't mean to interrupt you.
Now that you have finished your job, you are free to go home.
May I see two pieces of identification?
Is this a duty-free shop?

Ants and giraffes are distant cousins.
Traveling is a lot of fun.

I can't believe this is happening to us.
Who's on duty today?
You're really annoying.
The captain gave the order to abandon the ship.
I heard you switched majors.
He went to see her while she stayed in London.
He dislikes me.
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
Mary did it for free.
Did I miss something interesting?
I feel like I know you.
I woke up at sunrise.
I'm still sleepy.
Don't you want to be in love again?
Tom wondered why Mary had stayed in Boston.
Tom and Mary got back together after a trial separation.
It's nearly impossible.
He's a student of Japanese literature.
You can go anyplace you like.
The bar was packed.
Don't ask too many questions.
You came too late.
You're never too old to learn.
I think that you are twenty years old.
Did someone follow us here?
He had fifty dollars.
My wife really hates cats.
Our guest is waiting for us downstairs.
Stop flirting with my sister.
I don't need you to take care of me.
He can come.
After the storm, it was calm.
The fire burnt ten houses down.
Nobody's going to hire you.
We're a team.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
I don't mean to challenge your theory.
Pick a date.
Don't rock the boat.
She is the type men call "stunning."
What a strange story!
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
Tom introduced himself to everyone.
Is everyone recovering?
I think it's going to rain.
That's a good idea.
The squirrel climbed the tree.
At what time does it close?
She struggled to get up.
She likes painting pictures.
I'm heartbroken.
I'd be very grateful if you could help me.
It's already 7 o'clock.
She is living abroad.
Who painted this beautiful picture?
He became world famous.
Tom can't leave Boston until next Monday.
What have you done?
Smoking has a great deal to do with cancer.
A girl drowned in the pond yesterday.
I ate a light lunch.
He's thrilled with his new job.
Do you feel giving gifts is important?
Tom is not as smart as he likes to think he is.
I live nearby.
We went on a really long walk.
After a bit of googling, I suspect that what you said may not be true.
I saw Tom naked.
These boxes are heavy.
I like things just the way they are.
I cut myself with a hacksaw.
Strive to be happy.
Don't talk to anyone.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
I can't eat any more.
Are you sleepy?
How are the kids?
Was it difficult to make?
They ran through the streets naked.
She's not admitting her mistake.
I'm not a cop.
Are there any cute boys in your class?
You're full of surprises.
Everybody's in bed.
I don't know how they did it.
They escaped.
Children should drink milk every day.
I'd like my coffee weak.
He complains all the time.
He was punished for his crimes.
They're all here.
I have no idea where she lives.
Let her talk.
It was very dark.
Get to the point.
You've got a pretty good memory.
He was proud that he was selected by the people.
He did the opposite.
There's no need for you to study.
I really don't think so.
Tom knows that.
I'm confident that you'll succeed.
Are you up for it?
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
Why do you care so much?
If I knew how to use a computer, maybe they would pay me more.
Do you know how his father died?
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Drink some water.
I just cracked a rib.
Where did he do it?
Take it, or leave it.
We both competed.
We gave the car a push.
I'm really sorry to hear that.
He wishes to become a doctor.
That could be anything.
I had my reasons.
He washes the car every week.
Tom entered the restaurant where he eats about three times a week.
The medicine had no effect.
I said he could go.
I can't teach you anything else.
Why do you want to die?
You look strong.
You could get arrested for that.
Get out of the water.
I don't know what to do from now on.
Is there a youth hostel near here?
Are you tired of waiting in line?
I think it's time for me to walk away from this mess.
What have I done?
Did you hear it?
You're very busy.
We are not short of oil in this country.
Steel traps are illegal.
How old were you when your family moved to Boston?
Who's the boy swimming over there?

They live on the floor beneath.
French was the language of diplomacy.
You look so beautiful.
I love that idea.
The train was almost an hour behind schedule today.
Business has really slowed down.
Let me take a gander.
We need instructions.
That looks like it hurts.
Prices continued to rise.
Tom walks slowly.
This is a scam.
We had an earthquake last night.
The house is painted white.
They'll kill you.
You were drunk last night, weren't you?
Do you have a menu in English?
He's crying.
I'm going to take a bath.
I don't want to hear it.
What's the matter? Just tell me.
You don't need to say anything.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
She dumped me.
I'm working on it.
That wasn't my idea.
Now he has nothing to live for.
I knew we'd win.
Keep your hands still.
I want to buy you a drink.
AI stands for artificial intelligence.
Your mother died yesterday.
Let's list all the reasons we shouldn't do that.
There is something about him I don't like.
I am very tired from the hard work.
I think we should sell our old car.
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
My life is almost over.
I was satisfied.
I no longer believe it.
My sister is engaged in social work.
Do you understand me?
Tom had no choice but to quit his job.
You must be starving.
We're very satisfied with it.
Why don't you stay and drink some wine with us?
The thief stubbed his toe on the door.
I was speechless.
Several students were absent from school because of colds.
I've been way busier than expected.
Tom came to my office to ask me for money.
It's dishonest.
Your proposal is worthy of being considered.
Aren't you convinced?
I'll have a white wine, please.
I wonder when the Civil War started.
You're very busy.
Is this your room?
Please don't forget to mail the letters.
Where's the bakery?
We'll all be there together.
I need space.
Flip to the back of the book for the index.
Who's your girlfriend?
According to the paper, there was a big fire in Boston.
My father's hobby is fishing.
What's your favorite hot weather food?
They were plainly dressed.
I had trouble falling asleep last night.
I guess you must be very hungry.
He shot at the bird, but missed it.
I love buying on eBay.
There's going to be a math test tomorrow.
He does not live there any more.
How could you do this to them?
It's very difficult even for a Japanese to put on a kimono.
I'd like to say a few words by way of apology.
Nobody came to my rescue.
He believed that the earth was round.
I went out even though it was raining.
Hurry! Tom says it's urgent.
Do you mean to go?
Where exactly did you go?
I'm not convinced.
They have nothing left.
He looks like your brother.
You don't seem very concerned.
Yesterday I bought a book.
Tom tried to stand up, but he couldn't.
It's too late to turn back now.
I bought that book for Tom.
We have plenty of time tonight.
The first step is the hardest.
I want to return your money.
I remember it as if it were yesterday, but in reality it was fifteen years ago.
It was sort of fun.
Is he a friend of yours?
I disagree with this completely.
I am not a morning person.
You only live once.
I was bored with his speech.
Here is my key.
You must not give up hope.
Go to your room!
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
The fight is over.
She's suffering from a serious disease.
What is the reason for that lie?
They did a good job.
We're very different.
Mother bought me a nice dress last Sunday.
Could I work part-time?
My brother is a college student.
Can you help me, please?
I have an urgent message from Tom.
What else have you got going on?
He felt ill at ease.
Hundreds of thousands of people were out of work.
She ordered the book from England.
She majored in economics.
I keep having this dream about drowning.
I was deeply affected when I heard of his death.
Please let me off in front of that building.
Cars, buses, and trucks are all vehicles.
I don't have all the facts.
The water is deepest here.
I would like to eat now.
What's so funny?
It's not enough.
The table is green.
I think we've met before.
I jumped for joy when I heard the news.
You're very forward.
Tom comes from Boston.
There's not enough food for all of us.
I showed him my room.
You're a funny guy.
Do you still have feelings for her?
Many economists are ignorant of that fact.
I was going to take a nap.
Does that seem wise?
Please don't waste water.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
It's not cool.
The report is being prepared by the committee.
Because of that virus, many elephants lost their lives.
He not only speaks French, but he speaks Spanish, too.
He must find work.
Ignore them.
When did your father come home?
They're looking for you.
Hang on a bit until I'm ready.
I don't understand why you want it.
Tom may have missed the bus.
Someone is knocking at the door.
What are you wearing?
Does Tom speak French fluently?
Are you ready to party?
Tom was obviously worried about what might happen.
Get me something to eat.
What was your name before you changed it?
Did you call him up yesterday?
How many people did you kill?
I have a craving for fresh fruit.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Are you a doctor?
Tom and Mary both wanted a lot of kids.
I don't see it that way.
You don't need to know that.
Money isn't the only thing that matters.
He collected a lot of stamps.
You don't have to answer that.
It's not for the faint of heart.
I like watching movies in French.
Japan imports a large quantity of oil.
I have already written a letter.
They found out.
You must have been surprised to meet your teacher in such a place.
It's all a big joke.
They knew how much danger they were in.
He had to leave the village.
Tom is already waiting.
Stop crying like a girl.
I can't go back to prison.
What a jerk!
The earth is a lot larger than the moon.
Do you want something to eat?
The whole school agreed to the proposal.
I think it might rain today, but I could be wrong.
Where do we go now?
She is about my age.
I hope you're well rested.
It would be better to try.
The poor acoustics in the hall severely affected the audience's enjoyment of the concert.
It's not a big room, but it's beautiful.
He made me carry his baggage.
I wasn't making fun of you.
I can't remember doing that.
Is there any reason not to go?
How much did they give you for your old car?
The telephone rang several times.
This is a heartwarming movie.
Take anything you want.
Do you really think that?
Could we take you somewhere else?
Are you mentally ill?
I have attached a Microsoft Excel file.
Didn't you promise never to tell a lie?
How have you been getting along lately?
I love you more than anyone else.
Close the door, please.
He's going to regret this.
I thought you were working.
Do you have a guilty conscience?
I haven't got all day, you know.
I didn't try to kill anybody.
That wasn't what Tom meant.
We've seen her.
Ancient customs are dying out quickly today.
Tom didn't have the courage to admit that he had made a mistake.
I think we'd better start over again.
We should've warned Tom of the danger.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
I caught Tom by surprise.
Thank you for your present.
There are a lot of books in the library.
I thought we should leave.
Have you eaten anywhere interesting lately?
The telephone was invented by Bell in 1876.
She looked ghostly.
It is time to feed the sheep.
He tried in vain to open the locked door.
In any case, it's none of your business.
She left home after three days.
A Japanese would never do such a thing.
Cicadas aren't harmful to humans.
He advocated the reduction of taxes.
We'll all be hungry, so be sure to bring enough food for everyone.
I found a nice restaurant.
You can do whatever you want to.
I've spent all the money.
I'm pleased with his performance.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
Where do you want us to go?
I've been waiting for you for three hours!
I'll do anything to make it up to you.
We're still here.
How far are you prepared to go?
She took a trip to Paris.
Once isn't enough.
How do you say "hello" in French?
Does this medicine actually relieve pain?
Tom is very stubborn.
I remember reading this novel before.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
Atomic energy can be used for peaceful ends.
Don't go without a hat.
We all like cycling.
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
He stayed there some time.
That's the reason he became angry.
Loneliness and being alone are not the same thing.
He promoted the idea of world government.
The mother and daughter represented two generations.
How long do they wish to spend here?
Does he like me?
Did you read what I wrote?
That would be a mistake.
I'm not worried about them.
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.
At least they listened to me.
Could you hand me the remote?
I was all by myself.

Don't forget to put out the fire.
Which program did you watch yesterday?
Zap it in the microwave for thirty seconds.
My uncle came to see me.
I need a few minutes alone.
I suggest we hurry.
The day will soon come when we will be able to predict earthquakes.
We all cried.
He helped me carry the chair.
How about taking a walk?
He entered my room.
I'll be whatever you want me to be.
I can't believe you just said that.
We're all working hard.
She was on the verge of tears.
I don't like it when you swear.
He's not very good at it.
I hope that you will help me.
Stay down.
Take care of yourself.
The policeman aimed his gun at the man.
What's our destination?
What should I do if Tom calls?
I just can't get used to this.
Have a look.
This building is on the verge of collapsing.
When is the party?
Tom arrived three days ago.
This is like fighting someone with one arm tied behind your back.
Let's not be too hasty.
I also like painting.
She covered the mouthpiece of the phone with her hand.
I was flat on my back for a week with a terrible cold.
As soon as he returns, I will tell you.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
Who are your parents?
Humor me.
It's very easy to use.
He took off his coat.
I think you and I need to have a talk.
I think we'd better do that.
They spent the night on the beach.
They arrived at the hotel.
I'm slow to adapt to new situations.
Just be glad you're OK.
I love your dress.
I think you were right.
I have been reading this for a few hours.
What are you all doing here?
It's not very far from here.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
Tell me again when the concert begins.
Everything is now back to normal.
Everyone seems to be nervous.
I like skiing much better than swimming.
What are you doing in my room?
I didn't want to be seen.
I thought you had it all figured out.
He focused on his studies.
The doctor advised him not to smoke.
What you don't know won't hurt you.
We saw nothing strange.
If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand.
Isn't this place great?
This reminds me of Tom.
Do you have a receipt?
How many hours of sleep do you need?
Many of these things were not needed.
Tom isn't joking.
The audience looked bored.
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.
He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
I just can't live without you.
This elevator's capacity is ten people.
No one here seems to want our help.
Elves have pointy ears.
She almost passed out.
Will he come to the meeting next week?
I mistook him for my brother.
What's going on down there?
It’s hard to quit smoking.
It rained a lot that winter.
From the moment he arrived, everything changed.
There is a lot of crime in big cities.
What happened?
She doesn't have any friends or relatives to take care of her.
Is there central heating in this building?
I remember meeting her somewhere.
If you have an indoor swimming pool, you're probably pretty rich.
We never speak French at home.
I love the way you talk.
I have a poor appetite.
I think we need those.
What does your son do?
Nobody could explain how the thing was made.
Aren't you at least curious?
Cats have nine lives.
I've got to stop eating such sweet ice cream.
How long did he live in Ankara?
Apparently, there is nothing that cannot happen today.
I know all that.
It's a fast growing city.
You had a good weekend, didn't you?
I have to admit I'm curious.
They've had plenty of time.
Stop being so nice to me.
My duty is to protect everyone here.
There's a rumor in the air that the firm is going into bankruptcy.
She is brushing her hair.
They might be taller than you.
I thought he loved you, but as it is, he loved another girl.
No one knows the fact.
I can't believe this is all happening.
What do you mean by it?
He made up an excuse.
There must be some kind of problem.
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today.
I can't read your mind.
The goods will be delivered free of charge.
We had a really good time.
I don't think I can eat this.
Tell me about your daily life.
I lived in this house as a child.
I can't do it.
This book will give you a clear idea of the American way of life.
Why didn't you call me up?
Where are the shoes?
Tom loves his work.
I've got company.
They'll be rooting for you.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
It would've been nice if Tom had told us he'd be late.
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
I want to take notes.
Her slurred speech was an indication that she was drunk.
You never told me that.
Would you like to dance?
Faith is taking the first step, even when you don't see the whole staircase.
I needed a break, so I took one.
We're really good.
I didn't know apple trees grow from seeds.
We hope to do better this week.
I can't imagine why.
This chair needs to be fixed.
Do you like mine?
Ask her when he will come back.
After he said it, he was ashamed.
Obviously, Tom didn't want to go.
Our fate is in your hands.
Someone will do that job.
Why did you buy it?
I didn't buy them.
Why did you listen to them?
I guess I'd better start packing.
Where's everyone else?
My parents made me go there.
I have to go back to the office.
I'm real careful.
He lives somewhere about here.
I haven't slept well recently.
I got sick.
Tom brought a blanket.
The road came to a dead end.
Sooner or later, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself.
He does this all the time.
Tom is a professional baseball player.
Please leave.
Please let me try it again.
You must not stay up late.
I'm innocent.
He doesn't look happy.
Let's spread the map on the table and talk it over.
She's a dog.
You may go.
He is thick-headed.
Just observe your cat and you will get to know him.
I can't believe I did this.
We said nothing.
I made her cry.
You're very attractive.
Everything is going to be different now.
I talked to my friend in the FBI.
Did you volunteer us?
They didn't offer me anything to drink.
Can't you do anything to stop them?
It matters.
Why don't you come visit us?
Did you vote in the last election?
Is there a washing machine in the house?
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
Don't waste your time on trifles.
Tom trusts you.
They agree.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
It's nothing.
How soon can you have this dress ready?
Did I give it to you?
This is my wine.
This sounds familiar.
Don't expect overtime.
He was silly enough to believe her.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
Do I have to study?
We shared the profit among us all.
They're going to torture Tom.
Your car has a broken taillight.
I'll call you right after the meeting.
Zurich is considered to be a major financial hub.
You should try to see it.
Bring the water to a boil.
I sent it to you two days ago.
They loaded the truck.
That guy is an outlaw.
I exercised.
Keep an eye on it.
I think you'll want to hear me out.
I have a lot of money at my disposal.
I'm still not ready.
I always enjoy listening to classical music when I have some free time.
I dried my face.
The mail is delivered once a day.
There is no cure for lovesickness.
Give me something to drink.
My grandfather was wounded in the war.
What do I get in return?
Where did you guys go?
Tom left the building.
Come whenever you want.
He will succeed without fail.
I thought you were one of us.
Rabbits like to eat carrots.
Her voice doesn't carry.
Some people never grow up.
You are watching TV all the time.
I can't wait for Valentine's Day!
Let's go eat. I'm starving.
I was very confident.
I am eating a sandwich.
Tom wants to go home, but he can't.
I hate cops like him.
Tom always wears sunglasses, even indoors.
You are not a child any more.
Try and do better next time.
What have you done with the books?
He was unable to move.
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
We were outnumbered.
I bought many books.
We all know how this is going to end.
This isn't where I parked my car.
Tom's not a nice guy.
Let me take my coat off.
Does this mean you won't be sleeping here?
It shouldn't be a secret.
Just tell me what happened.
Tom is hardly ever at home.
I'm strongly opposed to a compromise.
How will we feed everyone if the world's population keeps rising?
I couldn't keep from snickering.
We enjoy talking.
He told me that you were right.
She was only 18 when she graduated from university.
I am forced to do it.
Would you like to join our team?
I'm behind him.
I'm glad to hear that.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
We'll get you a place to stay.
You were perfect.
Learning foreign languages is boring.
You are busy now, aren't you?
Tom drives everybody up the wall.
Do ants have ears?
Is Tom still interested?
He deals in used cars.
Rwandan rebels are pushing their offensive south as fighting continues in the capital Kigali.
I went, too.
I don't really have a cold.
Let's just do it.
I think I'd better call Tom.
All good things come to an end.
I'll miss your cooking.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
She passed by without seeing me.
I just remembered.
Who is your favorite actor?
Thanks to you, I spent all my money.
You've been a good audience.
You're not ready yet, are you?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
That's one of them.
Don't step on my toes.
All the players were in position.
The player faked an injury.
Fortune smiled on him.
I know these students.
What's your favorite number?
I don't often think about the past.
Fortunately, the shark bite didn't hit any major arteries.
Who invented the piano?
I don't care what's happened.

Her mother will continue to work.
Time is money.
Don't believe everything that you hear.
Someone is singing.
I love your daughter.
That's why I need your help.
I feel very comfortable with you.
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
I have plenty of theories.
She didn't feel like eating lunch.
I can't imagine a world without electricity.
Do you think those are real?
I couldn't finish it.
Do circuses still have freak shows?
That's all I want.
She must be on cloud nine.
That's weird.
I don't take any medication.
That was a great party.
The boy is thirsty.
She likes birdwatching.
That's what makes this so difficult.
Some people like him and other people don't.
Speaking in public makes me nervous.
I had him write it.
You can go wherever you want to go.
Let me check.
There were a few children in the room.
It almost worked.
Are you sure they can do this?
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
The withdrawal symptoms are more severe than I thought.
Have you been smoking?
We learned English.
I never thought Tom would do something like that.
He finished his dinner because he didn't like to waste food.
Tom does all his work at night.
I guess I just got carried away.
I'm driving.
This cow is not branded.
We skied down the slope.
You look tired.
We live in an apartment.
She got angry.
She lives in an apartment alone.
I don't see how it can end well.
Let me remind you of something.
Do you have any pencils?
Was he still here when you arrived?
I see you are ready.
I'll be glad to come.
It was rather funny.
Tom couldn't find Mary.
You should try it on.
Don't you read the tabloids?
How did you get interested in art?
I want to know where they hid the money.
Just get off the stage.
You are taller than she is.
He made up his mind to go there alone.
All I want is money.
Who is to say that what we did is wrong?
Greek is not an easy language.
Don't tell me to relax.
Let me go with you.
Just answer the question.
You're right about that.
This is not a trap.
Language acquisition requires creativity.
How much does this tie cost?
I think I can solve this problem by myself.
I like working for this company.
I'm glad someone told me.
You'll have to cook more food.
How rude of you!
Where's the rest of the money?
I miss that place.
I wasn't hired.
I'll show you the way out.
She showers every morning.
You can't handle this alone.
I'd like to go somewhere else now.
He has a butler and a cook.
Do you feel like having a drink?
Can they see me?
Are you already married?
Is that your car in the driveway?
What I really want is something hot to eat.
Where did I put it?
He had the gall to ignore my advice.
I wonder if a human will ever be cloned.
He didn't say a word to me all day.
Pardon me for saying so.
Haven't you eaten yet?
I stayed in bed all morning.
I had a quick breakfast.
I watch very little television.
Grab him.
The lights are on.
I took care of it for you.
Don't be so negative.
We've been talking about this for hours. Can we just drop it?
You're starting to warm up now.
I will stay there.
She says she will come.
Tell me what that man is like.
Let's try again.
I didn't think it was a problem.
I don't want to be your friend.
Tell Tom that I'm angry.
He died from overwork.
What makes you happy?
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
We couldn't do that.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
Do you have plans for tonight?
Tom didn't help me.
Do you have a twin sister?
Throw me the ball.
I knew it was serious.
She sang better than him.
It'll just take three seconds.
Don't come back until you've done what I've asked you to do.
Come play with us.
Where's my book?
Do you know me?
This was not the deal.
One of us has to go.
I know these people.
Gunshot residue was found on Tom's hands.
Are you enjoying it?
Call me anytime.
I hid it in my sock drawer.
I forgot to lock the drawer.
Was I polite enough?
Can someone give me a lift?
The thief used a screwdriver to break into the car.
Did you get fired from your last job?
I can't believe I'm graduating this year.
What if you gave a speech and nobody came?
Beauty is but skin deep.
I told her that she was right.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
"Will you help me?" "I'll be glad to."
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
Don't judge me too harshly.
This is my first time, so I'm a little nervous.
I need you to see this.
Why did you get so angry?
I said some things I wish I didn't.
Put the garbage outside.
That's really all I know.
It's nothing to write home about.
They agreed to start early.
We can see his house over there.
Are you hurt?
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Please hurry. I don't have all night.
Your order is ready.
Take off your clothes.
Are you going to go or not?
I'll go look.
I need to keep my eyes open.
Don't try to do too much.
I found this under your bed.
We won the match.
I will stay there.
Stop whimpering.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Sorry, I couldn't help it.
There is no way to confirm that he is alive.
Life without love has no meaning.
I expected you home an hour ago.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Where did you have the suit made?
She is my daughter.
I'd like to sleep late tomorrow.
Aren't you sick of eating here?
Don't worry. We have plenty of water and food.
Either is acceptable.
It's a lot of fun playing outdoors.
You really are something.
He is going to run for mayor.
He had no distinguishing features.
How are you feeling?
I can't believe it's raining again.
She's upset right now.
I kind of anticipated that.
I wasn't serious.
Get some sleep, okay?
I'm not saying anything.
We depend on each other.
He's an excellent kisser.
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
What song was Tom singing?
We lost.
After much consideration, we accepted his offer.
Whose son are you?
Let him go!
He was surprised to learn this.
The lawyer's job is to prove that her client is innocent.
At the moment, I have a pretty good job.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Wouldn't you rather sit by the window?
There may be a problem with Tom.
The book you gave me is very interesting.
Someone stole all my money.
Tom is married.
I don't sound like that.
I owe him $100.
He was given a gold watch as a reward.
How did you learn how to play the violin?
He is full of new ideas.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
May I use your phone?
She'll succeed for sure.
Tom is very hard on himself.
They're all here.
How come you didn't call me last night?
I could be next.
I can eat anything but onions.
This site is quite useful.
Do you have any books to read?
The child sat on his mother's lap and listened to the story.
Are you seeing anybody right now?
He went over to the other side.
I've been accused of murder.
They carried water in buckets.
Would you have time to help me with something?
You're very efficient.
I've been to Boston countless times.
You don't sound very confident.
Did you see the transcript?
We went too far.
English is a Germanic language.
Is she a computer programmer?
No one could deny this.
Do you speak English?
This is plagiarism.
We'll decide by voting.
How could I forget you?
Tom found my bicycle.
I love it!
I need more power.
Is the bank open?
Neither of us wants to get married.
I make a point of being punctual.
She failed every time she tried.
Get in the car.
There was only one case of chicken pox at the school.
Tom knew that Mary was studying French.
I'm a deeply religious man and believe in life after death.
I feel like throwing up.
The joke was at my expense.
This happened more than three days ago.
We exchanged phone numbers at the end of the gathering.
Please show me another one.
Be content.
He denied that he had accepted the bribe.
Tom is at work, isn't he?
Are you joking?
I enjoy it more each time.
I figured you could use some help.
It won't be that hard.
You had better go to the dentist to have that tooth pulled out.
Is that really what you want?
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
Tom can't see without his glasses.
I doubled over with laughter.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
She taught him the tricks of the trade.
All that you have to do is to wait for his reply.
I simply don't know.
The urban population of America is increasing.
I feel kind of tired.
Can I change the channel?
I'm coming right home.
Read it to me.
She accepted his gift.
You're on the right track.
I thought that would be a great idea.
I have to deal with this alone.
She's made up her mind and refuses to be talked out of it.
Someone is calling you.
Where is the boy?
That's a good reason.
I have to borrow some money.
Tom ordered a drink.
My cat is following me.
Close the door behind you.
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.
Where should I put it?
I just want to make it home in one piece.
Luckily nobody got killed.
How much TV do you watch?
I'm quite happy.
Your cat is overweight.
Did he stay very long?
He is now on his own.
I gave him what little money I had with me.
I like picnics.
Tom doesn't sing very well.
I want you out of my life.
I suggest we take the stairs.
They don't want you to know.
We could go there now.
What are you going to do during the summer holidays?
They agreed to work together on the project.
Tom may never be able to walk again.
Do you know what he said?
Tom doesn't know anything about that.
Has Tom been arrested?
The news made me happy.
She got the ticket for nothing.
You must respect your elders.
What have you come up with?
No one believes him.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
Don't give up the fight.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I feel honored.
I think you'd better come back home.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
I thought I'd dropped something.
The accountant would not concede the mistake.
I think that I was followed by someone.
I'd like to swim in this river.
He turned pale with fright.
He left a minute ago.
Remain seated, please.
Take a screenshot of just the highlighted text.
You're totally ignorant.
Tom was poor.
We have room for thirty people.
This clock isn't working.
He lives in a gated community.
How can you be so cruel?
Take this to your mother.
What does this device do?
Don't write me such long letters.
They can't fire you.
However, I'm not good at speaking English.
It is easy to answer the question.
I feel bad that I can't come today.
Don't share this with anyone.
How do you tell them apart?
This could save many lives.
My mouth is dry.
She took my joke seriously.
I think I might join you, but I haven't decided yet.
My customers never complain.
You're the teacher.
Tom will be happy to see you again.
Tom was cruel.
I'm smarter than you.
Tom can come back here anytime he wants.
I deserved that.
In bad weather, one can easily catch a cold.
I think it's time for us to leave.
I really liked what you cooked for me.
I asked her if she could go to the party.
It was the best night of my life.
She is a student.
I'm sure Mom will get mad.
You'd better not argue with Tom.
Don't try to stop me.
Do you have other family?
I've been waiting for hours.
He painted the ceiling blue.
No one left.
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer.
Do I need to go right now?
He is amusing himself by playing video games.
I'd do anything for those kids.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
The locals are very hospitable.
My room has three windows.
There's no wind today.
You're right about that one.
You lied to me, didn't you?
Give me a glass of water.
Does he know how you feel?
Things got weird.
He has to have his blood pressure taken every day.
They dealt with the prisoners kindly.
Are you happy with that?
We should love our neighbors.
There's nothing wrong with it.
It seems to run in the family.
We will fix this.
How often do you shower?
I want to cut down on the time it takes to process records.
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders.
I live right around the corner.
Your composition is the best yet.
We dined at our uncle's.
Spending time with your family should be your priority.
Tom eats rice almost every day.
The last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain.
We are going to travel by car.
Tom left me.
He likes animals.
The building was heavily damaged by fire.
Stop. You're making me blush.
We're sensitive.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Keep the child away from the pond.
I looked Tom in the eyes and told him the truth.
I think you're in danger.
I can't understand why you are so critical of him.
You cheated.
Why don't you join us?
It won't stop raining.
She is happiest when she is at home.
Can you empty the dishwasher?
Pork doesn't agree with me.
I'd like to sit near the front.
I was lost in the crowd.
I don't like being surprised.
No practical joker should be without a whoopee cushion.
You need to go.
Don't forget to ask follow-up questions.
They just want someone to blame.
You don't have to apologize.
He calculated the expenses.
Both of them started laughing.
We could all see it coming, couldn't we?
I made a bad decision.
A stranger spoke to me on the bus.
I'm shaken.
I arrived at school on time.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I really should have called.
Did you understand me?
She was unable to completely give up her dream of traveling abroad.
Tom bought Mary an expensive umbrella.
The dog looks hungry.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
There's no urgency.
My feet are small compared to yours.
The stars are shining in the sky.
How late do you stay open?
Never tell me a lie again.
We've just got to keep talking.
It was real hard work.
I truly didn't know you felt this way.
Tom died in prison ten years ago.
There are some apples in the basket.
Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
How's your job?
Do you let your children drink coffee?
Get to the point!
She always smiles at me.
I wear designer clothes myself.
He seems to have been rich.
Is he American?
Where should I put my laundry?
I just found out last week.
We don't need him.
What is he like?
Is there anyone who can pronounce this word?
Stop acting like such a weirdo.
I need a breather.
Did you volunteer us?
Remember these rules.
I'll look after your child while you are away.
If the medicine isn't working, maybe we should up the dosage.
You must think this is funny.
I want to know the whole story.
I hope it'll be fine tomorrow.
I had a good teacher.
He's adorable.
Do you mind my smoking here?
I never thought it would be so exciting.
This spoon is for soup.
She got her master's degree three years ago.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
That was different.
What age was she when she first drove a car?
People were lined up around the block waiting for the theater to open.
Could you please reschedule the meeting at a time that is convenient for you?
I want to know all the details.
If you have a fever, you should go to the hospital right away.
I canceled my appointment because of urgent business.
Be merciful.
Airplanes land at airports.
We need to be more realistic than that.
She's a lot smarter than she looks.
I don't want it anymore.
I made a fortune.
How do you think it made me feel?
Tom usually comes on time.
When were you thinking of coming back to the States?
Are you going on foot or by bus?
Tom bought me everything I wanted.
Don't bother to answer this letter.
What she said is wrong.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
I give you everything you ask for, but you never seem satisfied.
The fence is painted green.
Among the guests invited to the party were two foreign ladies.
How many books do you have?
We have enough time to catch the train.
I'll live on welfare.
She is distantly related to him.
The English language is undoubtedly the easiest and at the same time the most efficient means of international communication.
The boy made a paper plane.
Is the staff meeting held on Monday?
Can they see us?
I'll stay out of your way.
I've already filed my report.
You're very busy.
They sat on a bench in the park.
I fell down really hard and got a black bruise on my knee.
Tom said he wanted to talk.
I don't see any bruises.
He's a bigot.
You'd better take care of it.
That would've been embarrassing.
I attempted to swim across the river.
I'm not taking no for an answer.
My older brother is watching TV.
Please heat the water.
Does she have a boyfriend?
He will be coming to the party.
He keeps on asking me for money.
I let the cat in.
I like your hair.
It's computer-generated.
I don't know why Tom didn't do it.
I've been here since Saturday.
Please sit here.
You need to wake up.
How far are you prepared to go?
Tom, someone is here to see you.
There is an urgent need for better communication.
Which hat do you want to buy?
I saw the man knocked down by a car.
I'll just get you started.
I might as well get a head start.
Who are you waiting for?
Few girls can even speak to him.
Tom felt his phone vibrate.
It didn't go very well.
He is not as well off as he used to be.
Tom has been talking on the phone for an hour.
That's never happened to me before.
Casualties were inevitable.
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.
You are blushing.
We'll never make it.
I closed my umbrella.
I have another job now.
The train wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be.
I'm following the guidelines.
Tom has a big mouth.
They know things these people want to know.
I figured I'd find you here.
I hate it when you pretend like you don't know me.
He is outgoing.
I feel like throwing up.
The food was finger-licking good.
He was very puzzled.
How long have you been in Kushiro?
Computers are capable of doing very complicated work in a split second.
It tastes like chicken.
Should I wait for you here?
I'm listening to Björk's latest song.
I can't hear you well.
I just cleaned this.
The boss outlined a three-pronged approach to turn the fortune of the company around.
Why did you stop?
We had a lot of rain last year.
Whose room is this?
His speech impressed us very much.
Nobody showed up today.
I thought you went home.
I have no clue what you're talking about.
I didn't say I wasn't going.
Use this.
He did not want her to leave.
She accompanied me on the piano.
I need someone to hold me.
He is known as a rock singer.
I am worried about him.
I want something to read on the train.
That's strange.
None of this makes sense.
I have been wanting to ask you a question.
We should take a break and have some tea.
Don't drive under the influence.
It will be ready soon.
I belong to the music club.
She wore a beautiful dress.
He doesn't work here anymore.
He decided not to go.
Tom took the sheets off the bed and put them into the washing machine.
We found the boy fast asleep.
I loved that car.
The man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital.
In a few days, the baby will be able to walk.
Were you one of them?
He is in his early thirties.
She spends more time thinking about work than doing it.
Just tell them no.
We were very excited.
My home is your home.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
He is an authority on the humanities.
I can do a lot of things.
John and Mary have known each other since 1976.
You can't blame yourself.
Do you mind if I ask why?
You're really awesome.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
We're still not sure.
Don't you see what you've become?
Watch out for that man.
Do your homework by yourself.
It can't wait until tomorrow.
You're not as smart as me.
Tell me how the robbery went down.
I can't keep doing this.
We'll try not to let it happen again.
She moved out of her parents' house.
How thrilling!
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
A cold spell gripped Europe.
He bought a dozen eggs.
They all entered.
They were scared to do it.
I'm in Paris.
A Persian cat was sleeping under the table.
It was no laughing matter.
She spends a lot of time practicing the piano.
We're all out of booze.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
How can you not like horses?
I suppose Tom told you what time he plans to arrive.
You may still do it if you want to.
Everyone's watching.
I don't want to be chosen.
I want to watch you dance.
The sum of two plus three plus four is nine.
I thought you were injured.
You are morons.
Could you please tell me again when the meeting is supposed to start?
Tom paused to catch his breath.
He pushed me gently.
This fact proves his innocence.
He has a Toyota.
She spoke through an interpreter.
Why are we laughing?
The door is locked at nine every night.
He is one of my neighbors.
Was anyone else injured?
I like your smile.
We're dedicated.
Thanks for your help.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
I don't think I can do it.
Do you have a problem?
I've finally got the whole set!
I could kiss you.
What has made you decide to work for our company?
The secret of life is hanging around until you get used to it.
He picked it up carefully.
Please say hello to your parents.
The match was cancelled due to the heavy rain.
I hope he will get better.
Tom propped his bicycle against the wall.
I took a week off.
I've seen this picture before.
I thought you were smart.
I wasn't able to remember the title of that song.
Can I take my jacket off?
Did you bring a weapon?
I've got a question.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
I overslept again.
I built a new house.
Economy cars save you money.
It's a little scary.
What would the world do without tea?
How many do you need?
The painter died young.
What are some foods you usually eat with soy sauce?
He's your friend.
Never be this late again.
He was always trying to provoke an argument.
Isn't this wonderful?
Is that all of them?
Why were you holding his hand?
He did not like children.
Where are you going this afternoon?
We were kids together.
I'll meet him tomorrow.
They're waiting for you.
If I eat too much chocolate, I break out in pimples.
Tom fastened his seat belt.
The door is locked at nine o'clock.
I think you need help.
Please accept this little gift.
You must go up the hill.
She got no answer from him.
They cheat.
Some of them were wounded.
I want to find a way for us to be happy.
We all need to stay together.
Children play in this park every day.
Tom eats too much junk food.
I finished writing the report.
Just stay away from my daughter.
Can anyone report anything good?
This is the very dictionary I've been looking for.
Do you want to tell the jury what happened?
A bear will not touch a dead body.
What did you call me?
Please show me your notebook.
He is no longer welcome here.
Does anyone want some more pie?
That noise is almost driving me mad.
I have very few books in English.
I'm sorry for what I did.
Tom isn't a professional musician.
You never listen. I might as well talk to the wall.
My father has been dead for ten years.
He is foolish.
We took a walk along the river.
He often reads far into the night.
I thought I'd never hear that.
They're really ugly.
She must've been beautiful when she was young.
What can I get you to drink?
He won't call this evening.
Won't somebody please help me?
It's just the right size.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
I'm declaring an emergency.
Where would you like to go?
She advised him to give up smoking, but he wouldn't listen to her.
Tom built his own house.
I often meditate on the meaning of life.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
The dog growled.
I never thought I'd say that.
I have a stomachache.
You're the love of my life.
I like the way this flower smells.
I saw some small animals running away in all directions.
We're just talking.
It's doubtful if we'll finish in time for Christmas.
I try to please everyone.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I want to be at home.
We can still win.
Where does that road lead?
He looks older than my brother.
What does she do?
You're putting me on.
I'd like to sing you a song.
Do you know where she lives?
There were all sorts of group activities.
Make it smaller.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
He trusted you.
You didn't tell me everything.
I wish I could paint like that.
We postponed the event.
That's all I need to hear.
It was very different from what I had imagined.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
I've been saving up to buy a new saxophone.
I haven't seen him since then.
We're ready to go.
He has no redeeming traits.
My house is covered by insurance.
Hurry up, and you'll catch the bus.
Nobody else has a chance.
Let go of my arms.
I want to know why you're late.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
We can meet.
I left as soon as I could.
I have to talk to you alone.
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
He is eager to become famous.
They were never to return to their country.
You will soon cease to think of her.
The windows are open.
I cannot lend this book to you.
Do you plan to buy that car?
She rarely talked to anybody.
I love hiking.
Don't say such things.
He doesn't want you to know.
I read about it in the paper.
Life is full of ups and downs.
This question is too difficult for me.
How do you prove that?
Inoue doesn't like computers.
I'm not as rich as I was.
You can sit down if you want.
Go grab a drink.
He's a slob.
The temperature has been below freezing for several days.
Who are your parents?
People have a tendency to underestimate their future needs.
I don't think this is funny.
My house looks to the south.
I hope that it'll work.
You guys look lost.
I have plenty of time, but not enough money.
Children like fairy tales.
Guacamole is a dip made from avocados.
I brought you red roses.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Great minds think alike.
Don't blame the victim.
You're selfish.
Prices have jumped.
From the look of the sky, it may begin to snow tonight.
I really enjoyed last night.
The more you study, the more you discover your ignorance.
They weren't at home yesterday.
Have you figured out the cost?
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
She can't ride a bicycle.
Stay calm.
I thought you were working.
We're both planning to be at your party.
She stared at me.
Everyone's relieved.
He has a very dry sense of humor.
I felt left out.
I'm very glad to see you.
He works as a translator.
Is there a zoo in the park?
I know that you are a teacher.
We can't allow Tom to do that.
Heaven knows we've done everything we can.
I've never heard of you.
I tried everything.
I think we should all go inside.
I need my privacy.
Her viewpoint is limited.
That's how I injured my ankle.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
Don't tell me what I can't do.
Would you step aside?
Many companies advertise their products on TV.
Can I ask you a question?
What a relief!
He cheated me.
I'll be there Monday night.
I advise you to be punctual.
Metal contracts when cooled.
I felt the same way.
He tore his ligament.
A house without books is like a room without windows.
Would you have time to help me with something?
How many bags do you have?
They never pay any attention to me.
Tom and Mary agreed on a price.
Do you have a tattoo?
I want a written report in my hands first thing tomorrow morning.
Oh, I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
There was a heavy rain yesterday.
I'm a member of the team.
You can't imagine doing that, can you?
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
He has a passive character.
He's acting on his own.
I just don't want your dog in my house.
Hug me.
Have you told me everything?
Thank you for coming to meet me.
This dress would look good on you.
I just got here last week.
She gave birth to a pretty baby girl last week.
I'm doing this for them.
It's been a long time since I had such a pleasant surprise.
Everything is possible.
Try not to splatter the ink.
Don't forget your stuff.
Tom laughed at some of Mary's jokes, but he thought some of them weren't very funny.
Tom showed us his photo album.
Do you ever think before you open your big mouth?
I'm really tired and want to go to bed early.
What should I do now?
I don't like your boss.
Let me help you.
Say which one you would like.
I wish I could explain it.
My cell phone has a built-in digital camera.
Enjoy your weekend.
Everyone does what he wants.
I had no doubts.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
Give me a drink.
He is a spoiled child.
I prefer to eat alone.
Someone scratched my car.
Do you love each other very much?
We buy CDs.
What was all this about?
I've got plenty of customers.
I don't know what's happening.
He knows how to cheat people.
There are several exits.
I really wish I could be there with you.
Will you have some coffee?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
It's for you to decide.
I never get invited to parties.
Most signs are written in English.
Where were you all night?
I forgot my lunch and bought a sandwich at school.
Never tell anyone.
Don't let your feelings show.
I can't conceive of living without him.
We'll share.
I'm calm.
I have to go to work now.
You're making a big mistake.
They couldn't agree on anything.
Not every question deserves an answer.
Ignorance is bliss.
Tom is also studying French.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their natural talents.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
I was discouraged.
Tom doesn't have a home.
She especially likes music.
Enjoy your holidays.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
If the phone rings again, I plan to ignore it.
I wanted you to win.
Ten is ten percent of one hundred.
You cannot do this.
Don't let me influence you.
No one is at fault.
Where can I park?
You can see from his chin that takes after his father.
You don't sound very surprised.
Isn't that childish?
It's very dark.
You shouldn't look down on him.
You can't attend? Why not?
Don't make me angry.
I don't think he has anything to do with the matter.
I forgave you a long time ago.
Is that deliberate?
Tom has decided to propose to Mary.
I feel feverish.
Almost all of my neighbors are nice.
Tom had to swallow his pride and admit that he needed help.
An expert was called for advice.
Tom knew that Mary had done her best.
I gave it my best shot.
I want you to take this with you.
There are some people who think it's a bad idea.
Who is currently the richest person in the world?
They rented the room on the second floor to a student.
Why didn't you dance with him?
The nation was growing.
I suppose I shouldn't have said that.
I'd like to ask you about a student of yours.
I learned something today.
Can I park my car here?
Why are you being mean to me?
It's been taken care of.
My doctor told me to quit smoking.
I will be glad to help you anytime.
I'm not sure he wants to talk to me.
When the bell rang, the teacher ended the class.
You could at least try to be a bit more polite, even though it's not like you.
Her mother has made her what she is.
Police arrested one man.
The house is built of red bricks.
Can you figure out this problem?
The baby was naked.
I just got an idea.
Can you help me make a snowman?
Where's all that money going?
What's going to happen?
Tom killed Mary because he found out she had started the fire that had killed his family.
Have you read today's paper yet?
I'd like to explain everything, but I don't think we have enough time.
I am 19 years old.
Are you sure they can do this?
I still have some homework to do.
Well done, Tom.
What does it contain?
Is Tom aware of what he did?
That may be an important clue.
I was speechless.
My father must do the work.
Do you like Wagner?
Tom bet Mary that he could beat her at arm wrestling.
That feels amazing.
Since I was sleepy, I went to sleep.
Creationism is a pseudo-science.
Do you want to come over tonight?
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
I don't like being interrogated.
What an interesting theory!
We made sacrifices.
Which one should I use?
It's a rainy day, so we can't play outside.
Would you like to go dancing?
This is insulting.
Tom looked at the ground.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
I have no will power when it comes to exercising.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
He left her all alone.
Do you have a dictionary?
I want you to talk to Tom.
Be careful crossing the street.
It happened while I wasn't looking.
You are hilarious.
Who taught you to write?
I have been working for this newspaper for 4 years.
Thank you ever so much.
I've just eaten so I'm not hungry.
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
I didn't like my teacher.
He's spending too much time on the computer.
Get on your knees.
I didn't really want to do that.
What did it look like?
Is it happening?
It is good to see you.
I'm not bluffing.
From now on, let's keep in touch.
Are you sincere?
The tall man wore a pink carnation in his lapel.
I've always wanted to meet you.
Nowadays children do not play outdoors.
It was the end of winter, and the weather was very cold.
I brought dinner.
I'm really not very good at French.
Where's the closest pharmacy?
Did you read it all?
Don't tell anyone we're doing this.
You're not allowed to eat those.
We're not going to make it.
Take your time. There's no hurry.
You're very observant.
He went to some place or other.
I feel lost without you.
She also speaks French.
I'll get there before you will.
She listened to him.
Tom is chubby.
He may have missed the train.
Have a good time.
That fact can't be denied.
She was barred from the club.
I stopped to smoke.
I hugged her.
Have you ever given money to a beggar?
Come in.
Tom maintained that he was innocent.
What a big truck!
You're always singing.
You don't know everything.
I'm looking forward to the return of spring.
Turn the lights out now.
We've been friends.
I'm exhausted.
I really don't understand what's so funny.
She's busy.
Let me check my wallet.
It's never been done before.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
Give me a hand.
Her laughter echoed through the house.
When does it open?
I had hoped we might become friends.
A new difficulty has arisen.
Were you even tempted?
Tom told me that Mary was good at playing the piano, but I didn't really believe him until I heard her play.
Let me go!
There are no other options.
Are these all the same?
How big you are!
Just water, please.
I know it's a lie.
He made a vivid impression.
I never win.
She will be a beauty when she grows up.
It should be like this.
There's nothing more fun for me to do than to talk with him.
You're one of them, aren't you?
Pull over here.
You're taller than me.
He walked across the garden.
Take a seat.
Does that float your boat?
Do you think it will be nice out tomorrow?
His ambition knows no bounds.
It must weigh about thirty kilograms.
I can't let the matter drop.
His way of speaking annoys me.
I opened one eye.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
Your life may be in danger.
I recognized his face.
You need an ambulance.
Can I go to bed now?
Tell me which one to choose.
Which book do you need?
She reminded him to go to the bank.
In order to swim, you have to learn to tread water first.
Would you please open the window?
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Those are all important.
I want to watch this.
I'm always careful.
There's almost no water in the bucket.
Don't disappear on me again.
He got a prize for winning the competition.
It takes more than one swallow to make a summer.
Keep focused on your work.
I wanted to pay.
You must consider what kind of work you want to do.
Don't be so impatient.
His knowledge of geography is insufficient.
He was not pleased.
He always mistakes me for my sister.
I'm waiting for him to get back.
I've got lots of questions.
What are you crying for?
What do you have in mind?
Why shouldn't I do it?
I understand I can get a bus to Disneyland from here.
Don't lie. Be honest.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
You have changed so much that I can hardly recognize you.
Tom spends a lot of time on the beach.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
My girlfriend doesn't like scary movies.
Don't forget the drinks.
I speak a little Spanish.
I don't have a younger sister.
I'll apologize later.
This book is small.
We have no money.
Have you ever heard of Nessie?
Anything could happen.
Correct my spelling if it's wrong.
That's really impressive.
That's lame.
I can confirm this.
I don't care much for coffee.
You're twisting my words.
She claimed to be the owner of the land.
Which cup is yours?
Coming here was a mistake.
Are you saying my life is in danger?
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Tom wants to show you something.
You seem to have thought of something else.
What time do you think he'll come back?
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
I said nothing about the matter.
I wanted you to see that I'm not all that bad.
Tom poured some cereal into a bowl.
Is that what you were talking about last night?
No one knows her name.
My fate is in your hands.
You should act more calmly.
There's still a bit of it left.
I quite agree.
How did you get to be a cop?
I am not always free on Sundays.
There's no hope.
Do you like writing?
Tom didn't sleep all night.
Welcome to the club.
We had some good times.
You're almost as tall as Tom.
The furniture was dusty.
I don't have a problem with this.
I rescued you.
My teacher is a stickler for grammar.
Don't worry about making mistakes.
I shouldn't have logged off.
Did you bring the book?
He's a kind person.
That's our house.
What did I tell you?
Do you think Tom can find it?
Can you crank up the heat?
It might just be a coincidence.
You must let me handle this.
This vending machine was destroyed by hoodlums last night.
We enjoyed watching the fireworks on a bridge last summer.
Tom is your uncle.
Is your new computer working well?
His family circumstances were such that he became a teacher out of necessity.
Are you on dope?
Does it hurt anywhere?
His speech lasted three hours.
Help us, please.
The train was almost empty.
You look perfect.
He looked very tired.
"Do you like cake?" "Yes, I do."
When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least six different jobs.
"The phone is ringing." "I'll get it."
The wind calmed down.
You're resilient.
She goes to the movies once a week.
I deserved it.
I'll catch the next train.
Tom is saving money for a trip to Australia.
She practiced typing every day.
I deserve that.
I need a little help here.
This is an important letter.
I felt the same way.
I miss you badly.
I'm afraid there isn't any coffee left.
I'm attracted to him.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
She pooh-poohed the idea with a disdainful wave of her hand.
She'll tell him about it when she comes back.
She advised him not to eat between meals.
I like butter better than cheese.
We have no more in stock.
Many children were playing in the park.
Why did they hire you?
Why didn't you say something earlier?
My family are all well.
He stood with his back to the wall.
I remember the first time we met.
The teacher told them to stop fighting.
We helped them out when we could.
I want guards posted here and I want them here now.
I buried it.
Guess what I want to talk about.
We found out that he was her father.
After he came back from service in Afghanistan, Tom was plagued by flashbacks and nightmares.
My parents were proud of me.
Are we being charged with something?
Cook for me.
It's because I love you.
Turn the hose off.
How much does this cost?
He's old enough to be her grandfather.
I ran into a tree.
Could you get me some cough drops?
You should stop drinking.
I had left the key in the office the day before.
Did you have fun last night?
I think you should talk to someone.
Grab the end of this rope.
You like rain, don't you?
Do you know Tom Jackson?
The jury is hung.
I think they know you.
He can't afford a new car.
Save me a seat.
You're wasting both of our time.
I'm remodeling.
What did you answer?
I can't love anyone but you.
We found it here.
He brought me coffee, when I had asked for tea.
He caught a big one.
I had a headache, and I took the day off today.
Don't ramble.
I'm a little short this week.
Keep your eye on him.
I can tell you things you won't hear from anyone else.
When you get on the highway, shift into fifth gear.
Who can afford to buy such an expensive house?
You're forgiven.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
Don't forget to flush the toilet.
I must have tried on everything in the shop, but nothing looked right on me.
I saw Tom going into the cave.
You gave Tom the money he asked for, didn't you?
I have seen that girl before.
I didn't ask you to do that.
The maid made my bed.
We'll all be here for you.
He felt it was his duty to go.
We have a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
He doesn't like to eat fish.
I'll be right there.
I want to help if I can.
Your ideas about the government are different from mine.
He provided them with food.
Go down this road until you get to a traffic light and then turn left.
I told you to sign the document.
"How old are you?" "I'm sixteen."
Sometimes I can't really grasp the meaning of a word.
They're mad at you.
I want to learn Korean.
I don't know what this is about.
I need envelopes.
The fridge is empty.
It seems to be working.
We all escaped without injury.
They each received a present.
Do you want to install this free browser add-on?
What do you want?
She went to the hairdresser's.
Please say the alphabet backwards.
We have enough data.
She spends over a third of her time doing paperwork.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
My cholesterol levels are high.
What's your favorite color of hair?
It's a good start.
He told her that he loved her.
I'm not in any danger.
He tried wooing her with love poems.
No one agreed with him.
I don't know what Tom said to Mary.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
I don't even want to be here.
You were the one who gave this to me.
I understand what you mean.
It's a popular idea.
I hope your wish will come true.
She has a daughter named Mary.
He borrowed a lot of money from the bank.
Stop harassing me.
I'm starting to feel desperate.
Who do you trust?
The cat sat on the mat.
I've spent most of my life here in Boston.
Were you drinking?
I dislike all of them.
They don't listen to me.
Think of what you are reading while you are reading it.
You don't seem very sure.
One third of the friends I grew up with are dead.
It smells delicious.
Will you leave the door open?
I was born in October.
They're armed.
Tom didn't come to school yesterday.
Why don't we go together?
I don't need your permission to do this.
It's not like it used to be.
What did you talk about?
He was making a speech, but he abruptly stopped speaking when he heard a strange noise.
I didn't know she was married.
There was blood on Tom's shirt.
Is that so?
It's already time to go home.
Thank you so much for coming by.
Where's the Red Cross?
Can I be excused?
The bell had already rung when I got to school.
The doctor gave me a shot.
Why are you angry?
I'm asking you to tell me how you feel.
You never have any doubts, do you?
I gave him advice, to which he paid no attention.
When are you going to come?
She called him a liar.
That's what you've always wanted.
Quit acting like a baby.
You're the oldest.
Tom drinks a lot.
I rented out the guest bedroom.
Used car salesmen are a disreputable bunch.
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
I'd like to speak with my lawyer.
How unlucky I am!
It is true that I was head over heels in love with her.
Sometimes I don't get you.
The flag is up.
You're not that crazy.
Did you turn off the heater?
Have you ever had a narrow escape?
I love the sound of her name.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
This type of thing never used to happen here.
Are you sure?
The enemy is weak.
Please pass me the salt and pepper.
I don't understand why Tom is here.
That can't be good for you.
I think you're too picky.
Let's discuss the matter here.
Take mine.
The street our hotel is on is the next one.
Please don't tell anyone.
Did I hurt your feelings?
I want to make you happy.
We'll all be hungry, so be sure to bring enough food for everyone.
We're the same.
I wonder where she lives.
Show us what you've got.
We have to ask everybody this.
The word is no longer in use.
Handle this very carefully.
He will be back in ten minutes.
I'll treasure it.
I don't like this weather.
She froze at the sight of the big spider.
He never believes in paying any more for a thing than is necessary.
You have to hold back.
Could we have a table by the window?
You have a lot of books.
You don't seem too sure.
He would be very glad to hear the news.
I think we need to talk.
Ten years have passed since he died.
Who are you?
She's dieting.
The sky was completely dark.
The two of them were never to meet again.
I'd like to be in Paris.
Please be careful.
We're careful.
We're close friends.
Did you hear that a burglar broke into the neighbor's house?
No means no.
I don't have as much money as you think I do.
Can you think of anyone more suitable?
I'm in bed.

My girlfriend was crying.
I broke up with him.
Tom opened the car door to get in.
I've got someplace I need to be.
We arrived at the airport three hours before our flight.
I've failed.
Did I hear you right?
He is acquainted with the mayor.
You'd better not go.
Don't be so greedy.
Don't tell me what's possible.
I still haven't heard from him.
It's been warm the last few days.
Do you know where he went?
I'm afraid I've run short of coffee.
Have you ever been on TV?
Why would somebody want to live there?
It's really not that hot.
How about another piece of cake?
He pretended to be asleep.
He's waiting for you at home.
I bought you a present.
Sometimes I see him at the club.
I nearly blacked out.
Don't you think it might be a bit too expensive for us to buy?
Do you know who he is?
What do you want to say?
We found a beautiful, blue lagoon on the far side of the island.
Their goods are of the highest quality.
She did a good job.
I've come this far, so I'll keep going.
I really appreciate you meeting with me.
I have a boiled egg for breakfast every day.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Why not just tell Tom?
How did this happen?
He worked hard to promote peace.
You have to do it again.
I don't know where they are.
We could all be dead tomorrow.
Can I get you something?
I have to go to the toilet.
The two teams fought very hard.
We're all cowards.
His health has been getting worse since the accident.
I'd like to dance.
No one can hear us.

When did that happen?
Does that window open?
Are you relaxed?
Both Tom and Mary are my friends.
Walk ahead of me.
I pretended to work.
I've got to see a dentist.
What cold drinks do you have?
I'm one of your students.
Every Monday, I have a face-to-face meeting with my manager.
He carried the box upstairs.
They all entered.
What's your secret?
It reminded me of you.
He's a very nice boy.
They trusted you.
I think it's necessary for him to go there.
My father is not talkative.
I can't tolerate Tom's behavior.
If I were a bird, I would fly to you.
Please take some of them.
Is that why they died?
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
Don't sleep with the windows open.
I forbid that.
Nothing in the world is stronger than the will to survive.
They got the short end of the stick.
I'm often told I don't look good in a skirt.
I think I can.
My birthday falls on Friday this year.
I'm no quitter.
May I see the wine list?
She has a gift for prophecy.
Will it rain tomorrow?
He acted like a lunatic.
I wonder where to hang the picture he gave me.
Keep in touch.
Computers are better than us at playing chess.
I know how important Tom is to you.
I like blue.
Thank you for your gift.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
Here's a photo of her.
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
What shall we eat tonight?
Tom can't help you now.
I hope I haven't offended anyone.
Please hurry. I don't have all night.
I almost dropped the plates.
I'd like you to tell me what happened.
There isn't any film in this camera.
Don't share this with anyone.
She sued him.
We are happy to have you join our team.
At first, everything seemed difficult.
Do you want me to wait?
My cat loves catnip.
I think it's very likely that they'll arrive next week.
I will ask him about it tomorrow, then.
I am impressed by your recent advertisement in the New York Times.
Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that something like this would happen.
You should quit smoking.
I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor.
My knife has lost its edge.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
Tell me where you went.
You're running a big risk in trusting him.
You should listen to his advice.
The weather is threatening.
Children don't like to take a bath.

I guess that's right.
They're in danger.
You're a funny man.
I know what they're paying you.
She loves children.
He went deaf as a result of an accident.
Did you hurt yourself?
Tom will never agree to that.
We're not through yet.
He is not himself today.
Don't say another word.
Do not do that.
His wife has started to work out of necessity.
You're too polite.
Tom is wearing a black hat.
Communicating more to the point and directly would help everyone.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
We can't have you working for us.
I figured everyone was hungry.
This is a very nutritious lunch.
I thought you didn't want to go.
The rope broke under the strain.

You are the one.
Where are you now?
Have you got any ideas yet?

The results of the experiment were not as we had hoped.
I read about him in the newspaper.
Quit talking, will you?
He plays the guitar very well.
That's not going to help.
Tom always treats me like a child.
Since it's very cold, we can skate.
I know that's not true.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
You must be less impatient.
Did you go to Tom's funeral?
The trees are beginning to bud.
After hearing the sad news, she broke down in tears.
Don't worry about what others say.
Tom should pay what he owes.
My dog ate a paper towel. I wonder if he'll get sick.
Where did you get all these?
I think that fact is very important.
The hours are terrible.

I can't afford a pay cut.
He needs an umbrella.
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
Your idea sounds like a good one.
How long does it take by bus?
Don't take it out on me.
I saw somebody.
Could you please bring me a clean knife?
You don't have to go to the party if you don't want to.
He's the perfect man for you.
You are a troublemaker.
Don't call us, we'll call you.
You have to use tools.
This will never happen again, I swear to you.
You could have told me.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
I'm going to do my best.
Where is the book?
I meet him at the club from time to time.
I'm a bit of a reader myself.
I come from a small town in Australia.
We arrived first.
Maybe we can make a deal.
I outrank you.
Let's start with the easy stuff.
You should protect your eyes from direct sunlight.
Why did you guys break up?
Where is the police station?
They couldn't help us.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
My mother is a lawyer.
I think it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to do that by yourself.
I received your letter yesterday.
What is the name of this river?
I've got a pretty vivid imagination.
I have been to the library.
This is the lover's lane.

My parents persuaded me not to travel alone.
I want you to write to me as soon as you get there.
Let go of my arm.
Help me print this.
Am I hired?
I could really get used to this.
I don't believe one word of it.
How can it be done?
She witnessed him being killed.
Everybody's having a good time.
What are you waiting for?
Maybe you were right.
Tom has just resigned.
I want to know where Tom went.
We're uninsured.
I'm not persuaded.
It's never happened to me.
I never liked that one anyway.
I promised him to keep it secret.
He does it fast.
Don't you think I would like to do that?
It took me more than a week to put the model ship together.
Are you listening to me?
It's too bad you can't come with us today.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
Aren't you embarrassed?
Tom doesn't know much about Indonesia.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't like Tom.

I think it's time for me to show you how to do that properly.
The hunters aimed at the elephant.
I heard that he gave himself up to the police.

You sound like you don't want to be an archaeologist.
I took what she said literally.

His name is very difficult to remember.
My GPS works very well.
It was the most painful thing in my life.
I've finished.
I need you for just a second.
I shouldn't have accused him of stealing the money.
What did it look like?
I just bought these shoes.
Chess and checkers are favorites with them.
The boy has never been to the zoo.
He gave it a new name.
She spent the weekend by herself.
She looked after the child.
Which is the heavier of the two?
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
Who punched you?
She wanted a piece of cake, but there was none left.
We hope this will be to your satisfaction.
They need investors.
She was too tired to keep on working.
You could do it if you really wanted to.
You must not give up hope.
Can you tell me a little about yourself?
It's kind of boring.
There's the rub.
Come with me now.
I'm concerned.
Please help yourself to some apple pie. I baked it for you.
You should not do such a thing.
I want to get to know you.
Tom has three kids.
I hear music.
He had the gift of prophecy.
Did I tell you that already?
Are all the windows shut?
What a big eater!
I've worked all my life.
Show me some others.
Tom didn't choose the same thing Mary did.
Please write your name here.
I only did it for your own good.
My father grows rice.
I suggest you leave.
I realized what was happening.
Well, Tom, shouldn't we tell Mary?
I was thinking about the plan.
If you eat three square meals a day, your body will have the energy it needs.
He went so far as to call me a liar.
It was very nice seeing you again.
I need to find out who he was.
Why do you use this font?
It began to rain cats and dogs.

I'll tell you a story.
Do you enjoy studying?
Tom did time for armed robbery.
I just want to get a little fresh air.
I'm retired, too.
I've been to Hong Kong once.
He's going to join our club.
There was no one home.
What I want to know is how to do this.
We could go out together like we did last year.
I am sure of her success.
Are you kidding?
Tom asked Mary to look after the children.
Stay away from my daughter!
There's our bus.
I just thought you might want to go skiing with us.
What is critical thinking?
I don't know how they do it.
I prefer to go alone.
Are your parents home?
Should I call an ambulance?
How did you know that man was a cop?
It is imperative that we find another way out of this situation.
We ran out of gas.
I forgot to call him today.
Are you drinking green tea?
You must study your whole life.
He's crazy about her.
The wedding will take place next spring.
I'm tired of it.
What he needs most is a good job.
I had to get some money.
She went on speaking.

She has a cottage by the sea.
I hated school.
We're newlyweds.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I had some time to think about what I had to do.
Do you deny that you went there?
I want to know what I can do right now.
Don't try to be a hero.
I absolutely must know what you're planning to do.
I've done this before.
I don't think Tom can deal with the situation.
She made him happy.
Who ordered that?
I think that it's too big.
Tom gave his all, but it wasn't enough.
Tom is now older and wiser.
He was covered all over with white paint.
I feel sorry for her.
I mean what I say.
Stop showing off!
We were left behind.
Tom still wants you to help him.
The hotel has a homey atmosphere.
Long, long ago, there lived an old man and his wife.
Turn around, please.
My children live in Boston.
Tom is in prison for a crime he didn't commit.
I heard you switched majors.
She painted the walls white.
I can't change how tall I am.
Can you prove it?
I never thought I'd see your face again.
It's fun to ride a motorcycle.
You have my word.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I don't want to be killed.
He broke the rules.
Is this what you want?
It is no good to you.
Tom hasn't been married long.
I don't want to offend you.
What he said could possibly be true.
Did they hurt you?
Many Americans still had money they had saved during the war.
Keep focused on your work.
She likes these cats.
I'm going to get myself some coffee. Do you want some?
Pass me the butter, please.

Tom has some nosy neighbors.
I want a boat that'll take me far away from here.
I need the key to decode this message.
You have friends who can help you, don't you?
I was fortunate to find a good job.
Do you want to tell me what this is?
Our office is on the northern side of the building.
Whose guitar is this?
I trusted him with the money.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
I don't know what you want me to say.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
Is Tom aware of what Mary did?
Let's take a trip to New York.
It is not easy to find the way to the park.
You're so picky.
Things were never quite the same after that.
It was just the beginning.
I asked what was wrong.
We saw Tom on the beach.
He has completely avoided being sentimental.
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
If you didn't eat the cake I made, then your sister did.
They are not sisters.
You don't have any proof.
If you get bit by a rabid dog, you'll need a tetanus shot.
Will you show me the book?
He got lost while walking in the woods.
Look up the new words in your dictionary.
All taxpayers have the right to know where their money goes.
Do you play any instruments?
Do you really want me to go to Boston with you?
Why is she sulking?
Are they all strong?
No problem!
The government explicitly declared its intention to lower taxes.
It's all right. I can wait.
What do they call their baby?
That's good for a first try.
This is unusual.
The teacher was disappointed at my answer.
She is attractive.
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks.
I feel giddy.
You still haven't told me what your phone number is.
Don't break my heart.
I almost drowned.
There's no solution to this problem.
She may not wait any longer.
I think it's time for me to discuss the problem with her.
Tom looked very tired when I saw him yesterday.
I have to dress up.
She refuses to say more about it.
I'm afraid I can't save you this time.
Have a nice day.
I've promised Tom I would help.
We can handle that.
You can stay with us for the time being.
I did something similar.
Mary will stop at nothing to achieve her goal.
Women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition.
Whenever he comes to this place, he orders the same dish.
Who is sitting at the other end of the table?
It's hard for me to talk to Tom.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Mind your own business!
Take the garbage out.
She advised him to go there.
The door was closed.
I plan to never get married.
Please smile.
Does he live here?
Do you have more than one copy of this key?
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
You aren't like the others.
He advertised his house for sale.
He didn't believe it at first.
There was music.
It's hard to understand his ideas.
You're sneaky.
What a perfect night!
Can I get you a drink?
Why do you let Tom to do this to you?
I do not feel guilty.
I'm sorry, I forgot to do my homework.
I think life is what you make it.
Let me help you with those groceries.
You are a good boy.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
How did you get interested in art?
The twins are as alike as two peas in a pod.
We'll work.
Can you distinguish her from her sister?
I'll go and get your coat.
Could you lower your voice please? I'm really hung over.
It smells bad.
I was pleased.
Why did you tear the cloth instead of cutting it with scissors?
A merchant is a person who buys and sells goods.
Laughter is infectious.
On behalf of the company, I would like to express our hearty thanks to you all.
I think I ate a little too much today.
Have you been waited on?
The world is a crazy place.
I'm not here to fight.
I asked the butcher to trim all the fat off of the meat.
Do you like mine?
He got dressed and went outside.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Any one of us could do it.
I'm homesick.
Tom saw a play in the new theater.
My father is not always free on Sunday.
I'm very disappointed in you.
There's very little paper left.
I think Tom has a valid point.
You're not telling the truth.
The bank was run by private citizens.
I hope this doesn't ruin our friendship.
Can we do this another time?
Bring me a chair.
I surprised myself.
Make another appointment at the front desk.
Our music teacher advised me to visit Vienna.
It tasted sweet.
Let them do their job.
Every dog has his day.
What did they hit you with?
I do not think that she is at home.
Malaria is carried by mosquitoes.
My bag is very heavy.
Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
Can you make it safe?
I think they saw us.
It all happened quickly.
I didn't say you did that.
Have you been out at all?
I just wanted to see what would happen.
I don't remember that guy's name.
No man escapes death.
Last week my mother came down with the flu.
Anybody can read it.
I just want to be prepared.
The contents of the four registers are preserved by the called subroutine.
You're not welcome here.
I didn't even notice you.
I need a Kleenex.
I'm sure Tom had his reasons.
Everyone's lying.
They're all gone.
She helped me pack my suitcase.
She did it again.
I stayed home to rest.
How long have you been out of prison?
Where do you want to go?
They never found out the truth.
I have to take a bus to go anywhere.
Several guys were hanging around in front of the bar.
I wonder if Tom knows Mary's phone number.
We're not your enemy.
Tom is voting.
You were my friend.
What do you want to study?
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
Tom bought a Chinese-Japanese dictionary.
I'm not sure I follow what you're saying.
The world population grows by close to eight million per year.
Do you eat three square meals a day?
Have you done this before?
We found it very hard going back to our base camp in the blizzard.
I've never done it like that before.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Did you get his letter?
He is angry with you.
Let's not let our imaginations run wild.
The problem will resolve itself eventually.
Time travel is impossible.
I'll always be here to help you.
I didn't call an ambulance.
Mama cried.
I'd like to ask you about a student of yours.
Things are not what they seem.
It was childish of him to behave like that.
I'm behind schedule.
Have you tried that before?
A beer, please.
I wonder if something has happened.
Tom pulled a box from under the bed.
I went swimming after I woke up.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
Do you own a house in Italy?
I really want you to hug me.
They were stuck in the elevator for four hours.
Leave the room as it is.
You should mind your own business.
You'd better be careful what you say.
Did you see the transcript?
Don't let this information leak out.
She struggled to get up.
My grandfather likes to walk.
She is in her hotel now.
He left his keys in the car.
I met him about noon.
I feel very sorry for him.
He's enjoying himself.
I consider myself fortunate.
It was fine all day.
I bought the book yesterday.
Are you crazy?
You're not upset, are you?
Do you know how to tie your shoes?
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
How long can a dead language survive?
I'm sorry.
They live in a mansion.
I don't think I can answer that.
You don't have to come.
I want to make sure there is enough.
Did someone die?
Can I show you something?
He refused to shake hands.
He wore red pants.
She decided to go.
He and I walked together.
I think you need a lawyer.
They're going to try.
Did you fall in love with her at first sight?
I'd like to reserve a table for two.
I'm a bit short of money now.
Keep your head low.
You're wrong in this case.
How long will it take?
He wants to go out with her.
I know her.
Give them to me.
I'll never forgive you.
Why didn't she tell me?
He's a bit jealous.
That never was an issue.
Are you still scared?
What's their story?
They never gave up.
Tom didn't know he'd hurt anybody.
She speaks ten languages.
I've made lots of friends.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
That's enough.
Why do you want to do that anyway?
She is crying.
I ate on the bus.
We spent hours looking for it.
I think it's time for me to abandon that idea.
I had to get everyone's attention.
Tom didn't seem very busy.
Can I have a bit more milk?
So, do you like it?
You're very wise.
They've been at it for hours.
Thirteen passengers were hospitalized.
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
I ran into a friend on the bus.
Is this the place where your mother works?
I can speak French.
Will you show me your album?
I'd like you to help me install this software.
Tom reloaded his gun.
We can't see anything.
I fell in love with a girl from Vienna.
He was in good health last summer.
Please turn off the light.
A mere glance is not enough for us to tell one from the other.
Tom got out of prison after 30 years.
Our team is likely to win the game.
We have two ears.
I don't like living in the country.
Abandon ship!
They are very cheerful.
I have a reservation.
I must postpone going to the dentist.
Tickets for today's game sold like hot cakes.
It's sort of strange.
I don't have enough money to advertise.
He was scolded by his teacher for being lazy.
I want your answer by the end of the day.
I think I can answer that.
I learned how to use a hammer from my dad.
Is a thousand yen enough?
I'm not expecting special treatment.
I don't know what's happened.
Let go of my arm.
I don't think I've ever eaten anything that you would consider disgusting.
Mary felt happy when she learned the results of the election.
Tom often contradicts himself.
He can swim like a fish.
Anyone can ask a question.
What exactly do you plan to do?
Raise up your left hand.
How did you happen to see them doing it?
I didn't know you were awake.
Please tell me where the marketplace is.
Tom insisted on going alone.
The new tax law is full of loopholes.
A dictionary is an important aid in language learning.
I was almost afraid to talk to you.
Isn't that enough?
Have something to eat.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
They were caught in a blizzard.
We are doing business with many countries.
Things escalated quickly.
I felt strong.
How long did you sleep last night?
Who were you dreaming about?
My sister is engaged to him.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever held in my arms.
Tom brought Mary here.
Don't be so impatient.
Tom certainly fooled me.
I'm confident that you'll succeed.
All of a sudden, the lights went on.
What's this all about?
Do you have bread for lunch?
Take as many cookies as you want.
I'll never forgive you as long as I live.
When she saw that they had no schools, she started one.
The loss adds up to more than one million dollars.
Nothing lasts forever.
Tom is angry a lot of the time.
Learn to walk before you run.
We all had the same idea.
I am looking for my brother.
It's his, isn't it?
I don't need to go to college.
You can come if you want to.
This is my mother.
Don't make me say it.
Can you see that small house?
I have good news in store for you.
I haven't eaten anything substantial in 48 hours.
She cut the cake into six pieces and gave one to each of the children.
Not knowing what to say, I kept silent.
Prepare to die.
I'm the youngest in the family.
I don't know what happened.
I remember the event as vividly as if it were just yesterday.
Improved medical technology has been one of the spin-offs of the space program.
He demanded that I should pay the money back at once.
I didn't know you still had friends at the IRS.
It was an extraordinary year.
A teenager sometimes acts like a baby.
You don't need to stand up.
He has white teeth.
I like you.
She saw him at the station.
I was unarmed.
She had a pleasant dream.
I prefer to do it on my own.
They don't have to go to school today.
Father is angry with me.
It's not that strange.
We are defenseless.
Please remember to turn off the light before going to bed.
I'm glad we agree on something.
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
Which drinks don't you like?
Many Peruvians have the habit of chewing coca leaves.
I really want to understand.
Would you like me to go there with you?
How was your summer?
The noise gets on my nerves.
Take care not to catch a cold.
The landlord changed the locks.
I'm just looking out for myself.
My room number is 5.
We crossed the river by boat.
Could I have some coffee, please?
What a beautiful town!
You shouldn't say that kind of thing when children are around.
I don't think anyone really expected you to help.
Tom goes swimming almost every day.
Tom isn't sure what time the party starts.
I'll show you around the town.
Let him in.
We heard the door close.
I feel well today.
Where exactly did you go?
This is useless.
I may not be able to cope with those problems.
My brother went to the United States to study law.
Come and see me.
Come and see me right now.
He had no luck in finding work.
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
Tom can't have gone very far.
Play that song again.
I just wanted to see if I could do it.
They addressed me as doctor.
They ran through the streets naked.
When do you mean to start?
You don't want to be an editor?
You gave me your word that you would look after them.
I've come here to help you.
I have no money on me.
You never cease to surprise me.
Someone called.
They can't hurt you.
Stir the paint with a stick.
The desk drawer is open.
Why are you asking this?
Are you suggesting another theory?
That makes things clear.
Tom didn't respond right away.
It's got to be now.
We don't have that.
The cat was basking in the sun.
It has to stop.
Your threats don't scare me at all.
Please bring me my bill.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Come with me, will you?
Who are you talking about?
Be merciful.
They missed the deadline.
He kept the invaders at bay with a machine gun.
I looked out the window.
Do you believe in God?
After work, Tom is always tired.
Do you own a computer?
Tom has no insurance.
Tom is determined to lose weight.
He's probably sleeping.
I don't hear a thing.
She went to a movie the other day.
I like summer the best.
Ask her when she comes back.
I am a university student.
This is a bit too tight around my neck.
Thanks for bringing me here.
Hold your breath, please.
He closely resembles his father.
Tom teaches history.
She couldn't keep from crying.
I have no one else to turn to.
No matter what happens, just keep smiling.
I can't tell you how long I've waited for this.
Is that what you really want to do?
I'm sorry that I didn't reply sooner.
Don't worry. I'll stay with you.
I thought you wanted this back.
His brother is more patient than he is.
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I can't be killed so easily.
Tom works at a hospital near here.
I got up at seven this morning.
He rejected our offer.
Eating too much fat is supposed to cause heart disease.
Tie your shoelaces.
Tom is guilty of stealing.
How long are we going to wait?
No extremely fat man has ever attempted such a thing.
I just went home without saying anything.
I meant you no harm.
I had a horrible day at work.
We were amazed at the excellence of the boy's drawings.
You burnt a hole in my coat with your cigarette.
Here we go.
I already did that.
He had plenty of money for his trip.
It may rain tonight.
How do you know what color it is?
You don't have a choice.
She gave him all of her silver.
It's a small price to pay.
You're incredibly talented.
We did nothing wrong. It was only a kiss.
They will survey the desert island.
She is never late for school.
I ran ahead to warn everybody.
He is walking now.
We are doing business with many countries.
Show me your tattoo.
Judging from her appearance, she seems to be very rich.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want you to think I was stingy.
Tom has enormous potential.
I know a few words of French, just enough to be understood.
You can't put off doing that any longer.
You're unambitious.
Our marriage is over.
Don't take any prisoners.
He must have missed his usual train.
I feel ashamed.
I'm not even a little hungry.
I have to change into my work clothes.
This is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
He pocketed the company's money.
I will deal with them myself.
You must keep this machine free from dust.
Nothing makes Tom happy.
He raised the glass to his lips and drained it at one gulp.
I can't stand kids.
I have read the book before.
About how much money do you need?
He has enough money.
The ball hit him on the left side of the head.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Everyone should have a hobby.

There are a number of nice restaurants near here.
It's ridiculous.
Get a job so you can support your wife and kids.
His ideas sound crazy.
She gave him all of her money.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
I'm glad to be here.
I was scared stiff.

Have you arrived at a decision yet?
Tell me if you're going to give it to him or not.

Leave out this word.
I will wait for you at the bus stop.

I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
Tom glanced at the others.
Which one would you take?
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
Tom has what it takes to be a good teacher.
What have we done to be punished like this?
I feel like singing.
Do you have any other questions about the matter?
The lubrication system was poorly designed.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
I used to look up to him, but not anymore.
It's a very stressful job.

It isn't much of a car.
No one could solve the puzzle.
"Where's your book?" "On the table."
I am doubtful of his success.
The company is in the red.
So what're you saying?
I thought I'd never see you alive again.
Tom can reach me at this number any time of day.

Have you told Tom you're here?
Nothing can stop him.
I have had my hair cut shoulder length.
Commit these words to memory.
I'm adamant that you should go.
I just thought that you wouldn't want to go.
Do you know where they come from?
I put on my shoes at once.
You're impatient.
Whose books are these?
My left arm is asleep.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
I like winter.
Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up at 6.
He must be an honest man.

Tom asked me to bring my own eating utensils.
I was told that we have to bring our own water.
Do you go to school by bus?
What do you plan to major in in college?
When do you want to eat?
I was really young when I met you.
Is she all right?
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a teacher.
Tell me which you want.
I was bored, so I wandered around town.
The ball rolled on the ground towards me.
I can't believe you're considering doing that.
Why don't we order pizza?
He was so tired that he fell right to sleep.
Someone told me that.
I can't believe you actually did that.

My whole body is sore.
He was too old to swim.
Let's hope Tom doesn't try to do that without some help.
I thanked Mary for her help.
That's sweet of you.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
It's like being in a candy store.
Tom shook my hand.
What else did Tom say?
The experiment seemed to be going well.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
I, for one, don't believe what she said.
I don't know what your problem is.
Why don't you stop worrying and get some sleep?
They could've killed you.
You've always got to be ready for an emergency.
I would be very grateful if you would help me.
Don't rub it in.
I feel very sick. I want to throw up.
I can't turn it on, because the switch is broken.

Take care of your grandfather.
I'm no friend of yours.
Is there something you haven't told us?
I like baseball.
Keep your eye on him.
Can't you do anything to stop them?
Prices have gone down.
This dictionary is mine.
I sharpened a pencil with a knife.
He began to make excuses.
I look forward to our next meeting.
It makes no difference whether he comes or not.
May I have a road map?
He had been living in Nagano for seven years when his daughter was born.
She is no ordinary singer.
Why not start now?
How are you?
I broke off the engagement.
His neighbor will care for the children while she is away.
By the way, what's your address?
That's a very difficult question.
Sorry, I forgot.
Whether we go or not depends on the weather.
Will you lend me your CD player for an hour?
Another thing that is required is a dictionary.
She was the last person I expected to see in such a place.
That's a beautiful piece of meat.
Above all, watch your diet.
I don't know when I can get away.
Are you students?
He's looking for a job.
Have you ever wanted something so much that you'd do anything to get it?
Mary knitted Tom a sweater for his birthday.
People with rheumatoid arthritis symptoms should be careful about what they eat.
We took a walk along the river.
He rejected our offer.
Will you please show me the way?
Is he sleeping?
He drives a car, doesn't he?
Tom must be excited.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
I was lucky that I was able to find a good babysitter.
I pulled a muscle.
Why are you being mean to me?
I think what Tom is doing is amazing.
A butterfly is a mature caterpillar.
Could you keep your eye out for my car keys?
She was a bridesmaid at the wedding.
It's gradually getting colder.
I got to know her through one of my friends.
He knew it all along.
He went to the store to buy some oranges.
I say it's time for a change.
One can't live without water.
I'm not eating this fish.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
I felt good.
Are you up?
I always confuse which side is port and which starboard.
We're all prisoners.
This isn't possible.
I guess I could give it a try.
I got years of experience in courtrooms.
I'm making a snowman.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
They entered into a heated discussion.
We still have a few hours left.
He had a terrible experience.
I know you're richer than me.
I change my underwear every day.
Do your parents speak French?
Can you turn that down?
Just remember to have fun.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Tickets are available online or at the door.
If you want to, we'll go.
Be attentive.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Dance with me.
I can give you something for your pain.
Steel production will increase 2% this month from last month.
Do you know of any good restaurant near here?
She brought up two children.
If walls could talk, what stories would they tell us?
Tom was one of the invited guests.
That isn't possible.
This book is so difficult, I can't read it.
What do you do on Sunday?
This is a real popular item.
Remain seated, please.
They have a problem.
Don't lie. Be honest.
There are no more bullets in my gun.
It's all in my report.
You've turned up at the right moment.
I feel bad.
I'm having trouble focusing.
What exactly is that?
I have no appetite.
Tom never comes.
Who wants hot chocolate?
I hate mosquitoes.
He has a small advantage.
He's feeling really low.
Now go have fun.
That door won't open.
He attended the meeting in place of his boss.
Do you think students are given enough time to eat lunch?
How much are you being paid to do this?
Did you stay home to study for the test?
No one moved.
I never would've shot you.
I can't believe you eat that stuff.
This is an old letter.
He makes mistakes like everyone else.
It is cheaper to go by bus.
We had to wait until she found a chair and sat down.
I found my bicycle gone.
Tom listens.
Come down here and eat with us.
Do you know my name?
Could you please repeat that?
Do your parents know about this?
Have you already eaten?
He was accused of theft.
I will testify.
I'll cover for you.
It really annoys me when you do that.
I don't see your point.
Please turn out the light so that I can sleep.
Were you blindfolded?
It has to be tomorrow night.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
He breathed his last.
They tried to discourage him from going.
They climbed down the tree.
We must cancel our trip to Japan.
I'd never played that game before.
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
What's your major?
I figured you'd want to know.
She advised him to take a rest.
Why are you alone?
Tom always tells the truth.
You're making a big mistake.
She needs him more than he needs her.
How much money do you want?
I'd like to ask you to help me.
I like watching TV.
Do you know the man staring at you?
They'll all be here tonight.
It hardly ever snows here in the winter.
Nothing will determine our success as a nation in the 21st century more than how well we educate our kids.
I'm not discounting that possibility.
She taught me how to swim.
I'm breaking up with my girlfriend tonight.
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me.
You're old enough to know better.
"Are you a teacher?" "Yes, I am."
He's a good liar.
No students went there yesterday.
They have many friends.
I would lay down my life for you.
What time did your friend go home?
Did you have a good time yesterday?
They are sensible girls.
Don't send me home, please.
We haven't had to deal with this before.
I saw one.
You owe Tom an apology.
I met them.
Where have you been all this time?
I don't find that comforting.
The weather is terrible today.
Who did you meet there?
I thought they wouldn't like you.
I want to read this book.
I am in no position to do anything about it.
She insulted him.
She said that she was happy.
Let me know what you want to do.
What kind of music does Tom listen to?
He went backstage after the show.
I hadn't thought about that.
She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
They painted the fence green.
People live only about 70 years.
Speak a little louder.
Have a nice flight.
She doesn't know how to swim.
That's not what I'm afraid of.
I've forgotten my email address.
The train arrived on schedule.
I never read the book.
I remember when we used to never eat vegetables that we didn't grow ourselves.
The only thing that matters is that you weren't injured.
I'm optimistic.
Tom is vulgar.
It doesn't look right.
I want to know who told you that.
He decided not to go.
Where is the logic in that?
I prefer to go alone.
She has long hair.
The boy remained silent.
Do not oversleep tomorrow morning.
When do you intend to start?
You'll get a lot of presents on your birthday.
The bicycle is mine.
I was going to run over the notes one last time, but there wasn't time.
You're not married, are you?
My arm still hurts.
I like Boston a lot.
Your answer to the question turned out to be wrong.
Even though I ate three bowls of cereal for breakfast, I'm still hungry.
Almost no one believed her.
I'm going to buy you a watch.
He is an intelligent boy.
Take your umbrella with you in case it rains.
Tom buttoned his coat.
You're such an idiot!
Stand aside.
Dust off the shelf.
You should know that by now.
What do you do for a living?
I got dizzy.
I want to cook for you.
They joined forces and fought the enemy.
All sales are final.
I had a strange dream.
They look confused.
I'd suggest that you clean up a bit before your mother gets here.
You can't keep something that big a secret.
They come from the same country.
I want you all out of here.
Don't make me blush.
They got it.
Take whichever you like best.
Have a drink.
I still need to renew my passport.
Tom wants me to apologize.
I would like to kiss you.
You don't know how lucky you are.
He has a very good sense of humor.
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
I have not eaten breakfast yet.
When did I ever hurt you?
That was our first encounter.
We haven't found it.
Tom collects antiques.
How would you describe yourself?
I'm sick and tired of reading.
You're very generous.
I just got your message.
You need to be more patient.
Go away before they see you here.
He got through with his work.
You seem distracted today.
We're out of money.
I want a rematch.
You are blinded by love.
What's wrong with being nude in your own house?
I give you two permission to do whatever you think is necessary.
I want to talk.
Are you here to help us?
Everyone knows his name.
Tom won't remember a thing.
There are many people in the park.
I don't know when he'll come.
That's a tree.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I asked Tom why he wasn't planning to go to Boston with us.
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do.
Am I making myself clear?
What do you want to talk about?
I get along with everybody.
I work as a consultant.
You'd better go.
Read what's on the label.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Please turn on the radio.
Hundreds of animals were killed.
That student's studying sociology.
If I'd known what you were going to do, I'd've tried to stop you.
I shouldn't have walked home late at night by myself.
It will cool down tonight.
We must obey the rules.
You sound tired.
Maybe your earring is under the table.
I think it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to escape from this prison.
I was exhausted from work.
I got fined.
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
The contents of the box are listed on the label.
You look perfect.
I can do it all myself.
You should stick those pictures in your album.
How long would it take to swim across the river?
I love performing.
Stay out of my way!
Do you remember us?
I guess you're right.
We should save money for a rainy day.
Everything on top of the table started rattling when the earthquake hit.
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
Do you want to rent your house?
He was acting on orders.
How does this disease spread?
Mother is in the kitchen.
Tom knew what Mary had done.
I thought you needed money.
Tom will tell me everything eventually.
My father is far from artistic.
This is what you're supposed to do.
Have you had a thorough medical checkup within the last year?
I think Tom didn't understand you.
Where's convenient for you?
Do you think he made that mistake on purpose?
She promised not to tell anyone.
Everyone started clapping.
I already sold that.
We should spend our time creating content for our website rather than wasting time worrying about minor cosmetic details.
You'd better watch what you say.
I don't know.
I would hate to become just a housewife.
What do you call that?
You are the only one who can help me.
I have nothing to report so far.
He was busy yesterday afternoon.
You can rest.
Let's go to the flea market tomorrow.
Tom missed it.
You're free of all responsibility.
I wish I could remember his name.
Tom can't tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine.
People are dying.
A little louder, please.
I think that he is right.
When I got home, I had a nice, ice-cold shower.
The weather is cold all year here.
We couldn't help but think that he was dead.
I know how to drive a car.
I've never been there.
Do your own job.
Tom's body was never found.
How do you know they're looking for us?
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I will go abroad next year.
Don't you like Chinese food?
Nobody loves war.
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
I'm proud of you all.
Thousands of people became victims of this disease.
Your work has greatly improved.
What does this sentence mean?
She made jam from the apples.
She spends way too much time surfing the web.
As far as I know, there is no such word.
She's not a child.
I felt bad about what I did.
Let's not waste this chance.
No matter how hard you may try, you won't succeed so easily.
I had a good time during the trip.
Never confuse art with life.
He sneaked around to the back door.
I don't want to go with you.
All the passengers got seasick during the storm.
The street is clogged with traffic.
I haven't seen you around before.
I heard a woman scream.
There was a discussion on the measures.
What are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to propose to her.
Do you want me to shuffle the cards?
Start reading where you left off.
We shall try to answer the following questions.
We got along famously.
I eat lunch here two or three times a week.
Don't pull my sleeve.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
He fell off the horse.
You look perfect.
He loves attention.
That's the problem we have to solve.
He's feeling much better.
He has not come yet. He may have missed the train.
Tom's excited.
This dress suits you well.
They will cut down on their expenses.
I'm still in shock.
Advances in science don't always benefit humanity.
I wanted to make new friends.
Keep your hands up.
How did you find out where Tom lives?
Don't just stand there.
Their way of thinking is behind the times.
Don't take yourself so seriously.
She complained about my low salary.
Tom understands what you don't.
Please back me up!
I didn't know you had a sister.
You look just like him.
He waited for him until 10.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
It's a matter of pride.
Haven't you seen the doctor?
Most people can't tell the difference.
There is a bank in front of the station.
You didn't let me answer.
This is your dog.
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
You think I don't know what's going on?
Mary is studying in her room.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
That's the last thing I remember.
That is our school.
I think you might need my help.
Don't blame me.
Stop yelling!
Read as many books as possible.
Did you make up your mind?
Every morning she gets up early because she has to cook.
Tom went down to the basement.
Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything.
Am I allowed to use this?
I'd like this meeting to last no more than twenty minutes.
I am from Brazil.
A well-made cup of coffee should require no cream or sugar.
They say that he knows the secret.
Fish cannot live out of water.
Her attitude disgusts me.
I've got some chores to do.
May I be honest?
It's your duty to finish the job.
Were you busy yesterday?
It was a bad movie.
I like these.
Congratulations!
Could I have the bill, please?
I just fainted. That's all.
When I got out of prison, I couldn't find a job anywhere near my home since no one would hire an ex-con.
"Anything else?" "No, that's all."
Would you bring me another one, please?
I really hope things work out for you.
Don't leave your stuff behind.
They were spending money.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.

I've never heard of such a thing.
He reads a great deal.
One of the best ways to help us is to translate from a foreign language you know into your own native language or strongest language.
Let's visit my grandpa this weekend.
I remember those days.
I got fined.
Tell her that I am treating a patient.
He asked my mother.
No matter how hard he tried, my opinion didn't change.
This child solved the complicated mathematics problem easily.
I can't figure out how to transfer MP3 files from my iPod back to my computer.
I don't know where he went.
I'd like to run a few more tests.
We thought that you were married.
Are you ready to begin?
He is seeking employment.
Could we sit?
She felt like crying.
I believe in what they said.
They started the meeting without me.
He lives in the next town.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
A book not worth reading is not worth buying in the first place.
She cried all night.
A "renovator's dream" in real estate parlance generally means that the place is a real dump.
I was terribly offended.
Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
You'd better not go there.
I want you to know that I believe you.
That is a pure waste of time.
I'm ready for tomorrow.
I've been gone for a long time.
They spoke briefly.
We don't want that, do we?
He gave me a penetrating gaze.
This car is very expensive.
You can't tell anyone about this.
Could you do me a favor?
It's my father who stopped drinking.
He has an incurable disease.
I thought you said you couldn't eat raw fish.
I want to spend more time doing things that make me happy.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
It was his first trip as a captain.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Tom.
Isn't that ours?
I can't see him either.
It reminds me of the good old days.
You don't look like a millionaire.
I love traveling alone.
I'm not sure anything happened.
He had no idea what to expect.
All the lights were on.
It started raining just as I was leaving home.
Tom and Mary are getting married in October.
Tom doesn't look pleased.
If he studied hard, he would pass the test.
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
Come home before dark.
This is a big deal.
I can't believe I'm still alive.
Tom didn't look as happy as Mary.
My father and mother were sitting under a tree.
I don't have a computer.
A selfish man thinks of nothing but his own feelings.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
I was too stunned to talk.
My sister's hair reaches to her shoulders.
He has quite a few records.
A GPS device can pinpoint your location anywhere in the world.
You were jealous, weren't you?
The widow was dressed in black.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
I want to hear more about your trip.
That is no business of his.
I'm untalented.
There's a rumor going around.
Would you like me to repeat the question?
I haven't seen you in ages.
A crowd collected to watch the fight.
I didn't like my teacher.
I no longer wish to be your husband.
Can you help me wash these dishes?
What kind of meal did you eat?
You're turning red.
I don't think I can help you.
I think you are mistaken.
Be confident.
He squinted.
Show them to me.
Tom likes to go to the beach.
We got separated.
They both laughed.
You're the only one I trust.
The park is located in the center of the city.
I like English.
We have less than five minutes to evacuate the whole building.
He's a little taller than you are.
No matter how hard I try, I will never be able to catch up with him.
What do you say we go there?
Tom put the thermometer on the wall.
You can't keep talking to me like this.
I did something wrong.
They saw us as they were getting off the train.
When was it finished?
I said get out.
My dream is to make it as an actor in Hollywood.
You don't need to go there.
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
Copper conducts electricity well.
I read an exciting story.
Let's pitch the tent while it's still light.
Tom doesn't like taking risks.
They had a heated argument.
It's not my job to do that.
Some stores discount the price.
The patient's in the hospital.
That might depend on your point of view.
Have you seen the dog? He wandered off a couple of minutes ago.
I wish I had eaten something else.
I'll go to Paris when I have the money necessary.
She fainted, but came to after a few minutes.
We lost, but we had fun.
You've been busy, haven't you?
Where's the catch?
It's not right.
Do not be shy. Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
Soon it will be gone.
I demand satisfaction.
I'm not good enough for you.
They didn't swim because it was cold.
I don't have any nice clothes.
Tom was going to help us.
It's not natural for a mother to outlive her child.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
He reached for the dictionary.
I will never forget seeing you.
You can get a loan from a bank.
I'm shy.
Stay calm and do your best.
We agreed on a price.
You've been very kind to me.
He took a picture of the beautiful landscape.
The students all laughed.
Is this your dog?
I don't like his hat.
I'm a little bit hungry.
Are you working today?
We're worried.
I concentrated my attention on the subject.
You're not normal.
I had some help painting the fence.
Would you lend me some money?
I'd like to go with you if you don't mind.
I meant to look it up.
I'm sorry I shot you.
The teacher caught the student cheating on the examination.
The rain lasted three days.
You cannot be serious.
I don't have the slightest clue.
They hid themselves in the shadows.
Tom put the screws in a small plastic bag.
This smells good.
It's not our responsibility.
The cold weather extended into April.
It's obvious to everyone that he's a genius.
I'll borrow us some tools.
Now I'm used to it.
I've got to learn some new songs.
Advance two steps.
She quickly opened the letter.
I hope he's all right.
I'll find someone else to help me.
My idea is different from yours.
I never should've come here.
I'll answer all your questions.
Where was this picture taken?
This camera is less expensive than that one.
I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager.
It took me a couple of hours to solve this problem.
I don't think Mary is as pretty as her sister.
I'm the one who brought the subject up.
Why don't you repaint your house?
I heard the news on the radio.
No one seems to care.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
I lent Tom my camera.
I have to answer his letter.
I'll be singing a song at Tom and Mary's wedding.
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than to get permission.
I'm trying to talk to you.
His speech made no sense to me.
I'm sorry about last night.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
Only God can help you now.
You shouldn't break promises.
She looks as if she were drunk.
A bird is known by its song and a man by his way of talking.
I can't tell you what happened.
Mary took out a loan in order to pay her debts.
Tom killed a man.
I don't know you.
Why did you put off the printing of my book?
It is man's destiny to suffer.
Did you have fun last night?
I am better.
Can I tell my father what you want?
Tom asked Mary to lend him some money.
Don't read my journal.
It is questionable whether this data can be relied on.
You'd better get up early.
Many languages use English words.
There were some boats on the lake.
Get out of the car.
Keep away from that pond, please.
I'm used to working all night.
We're paying.
Please make yourself at home.
Now we wait.
Don't ask questions, just come with me.
Tom backed out at the last moment.
If you want me to help you, all you have to do is ask.
When did you notice that?
You're very efficient.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
He is five feet tall.
Money doesn't necessarily make you happier.
I have a lot in common with him.
Can you tell me what is happening?
Can my daughter go to school?
Does it hurt when you chew?
I'd like nothing better than to do that.
Try it again.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
I didn't want to believe it myself.
I think it's time for me to get a new pair of glasses.
I'll be around.
That's the other reason I'm here.
I let my guard down momentarily.
She wanted to wash the dirty clothes.
This was Tom's idea, wasn't it?
Life is too short.
Which club do you belong to?
This could become a big problem.
Everybody wants to be happy.
It's really cool here.
I don't feel well.
I can type 50 words a minute.
This is the reason I disagree with you.
She put up the new curtains today.
What do you have planned for the afternoon?
I want my money returned immediately.
If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry.
I never thought he was capable of doing something so cruel.
He settled down in his armchair to listen to the music.
Tom didn't know why Mary needed to borrow thirty dollars.
She didn't like him at first.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
She is everything to him.
I'm glad you see it that way.
Let it be.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
I can survive.
How much will you get?
No matter who comes, don't open the door.
Is there something in particular that you want to drink?
It's a little dated.
I think he likes you.
Mastering a foreign language calls for patience.
I just got up.
The DNA test cleared him of all charges.
You don't seem very pleased.
It sounds easy.
Do you know who he was?
France is in Western Europe.
I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.
They were in the shower.
You may choose one of them.
Jump as high as you can.
I heard what Tom said to Mary.
We are going to make up for lost time by taking a short cut.
It's a bargain.
Tom was disappointed in Mary's performance.
Tom is not fond of pets.
You should run for president.
My sister's going to kill me.
I will fight.
It's better you don't know.
No one in his class can run faster than he does.
Compared to you, I'm just a beginner at this game.
The three-day discussion was worthwhile.
Would you like to tell me something else?
I am so sick.
Whatever happened to your pride?
I never see you without thinking of my father.
The moon came out from behind the clouds.
She gave him a watch.
I rewrote my report.
Poverty does more to bring out the worst in people and conceal the best than anything else in the world.
Can't you ride a bicycle?
Do you honestly believe that?
Tom is on the phone.
Do you eat a lot?
We should be proud of ourselves.
What kind of food do you usually eat?
The storm prevented us from arriving on time.
France used to have many colonies in Africa.
My father quit drinking.
I wonder what she really means.
A horse is an animal.
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
We are sorry for the interruption.
I read the book.
Why would you want to share this type of information with people you hardly know?
I am exhausted.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
They're lucky to be alive.
He often takes me for a drive.
Please do not walk on the grass.
Don't be so noisy, please.
Tom told me that the book was interesting.
I am taking a bath now.
It's all your fault.
Tom and Mary studied together.
I'm beginning to feel guilty about it.
You're out of booze.
He drank detergent by mistake.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
He's your friend.
We have to warn him.
What do you want to be?
He did not work on Sunday night.
He is clever indeed.
She has good control over her class.
It's the law now.
I bought an old lamp.
They demanded that the mayor should resign.
I need food.

Do you have a moment?
You're going to love this book.
I believe we can get that done.
Did anybody see you?
What did it feel like?
I want you to come to my wedding.
Do your homework right away.

"How much did you pay for this?" "About 20 euros." "Wow! That's incredibly cheap."
They are crazy about jazz.
I had a very tight schedule last week, but this week I'm relatively free.
It'll happen.
I'll call the chef.
She was painfully thin.
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
I won't be running for mayor.
It is necessary for you to study harder.
I'm baking!
Stop acting like a baby.
Are you sure you know where Tom's house is?
I'm too tired to drive.
Would you consider this a good proposal?
Come in. The door is open.
I never said that I wanted that.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
None of them said anything.
I'm afraid of heights.
I have lots of ideas.
I feel kind of sick.
I was moved to tears by the story.
Would you like a cup of milk?
He touched my hand.
Why are you out at this hour?
That's reason enough.
He was like a father to me.
Is she your only daughter?
I had some work that I needed to do.
I suggest you get some rest.
Everybody loves music.
I think God is a woman.
What was the first concert you went to?
Try not to think about it.
The press is interested in his private life.
He married a farmer's daughter.
I don't know what you're so worried about.
The picnic was called off because of rain.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
It began to rain, so he did not have to water the lawn.
You are free to do as you please with your money.
She has absolutely no enemies.
I am sure of his passing the examination.
You're overworked.
She has a piano lesson once a week.
Tom left the room without saying a word.
The income from this source is tax-free.
The poor child was born deaf and dumb.
Have you ever been run over?
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
What have you come here for?
I can't tell you what we did last night.
I remember seeing you last year.
The airplane landed on my father's farm.
You're no different.
Tom often goes fishing.
I love you people.
Did you catch what he said?
Did you foresee this?
I want the whole world to know that we're in love.
The last part of the trip was across the desert.
Tom drank lemonade.
Tom told us to take our time.
Didn't you hear me calling?
Don't feed the dog.
I need a pen.
I'll sleep on the futon.
You won't regret this. I promise.
I wish I had eaten lunch before I came here.
Tom had his wallet stolen while he was in Boston.
The organ started to play.
Do you think the situation can improve?
I'm going to see her tomorrow.
I love you guys.
Tom seems so nice.
I don't intend to get mixed up in your business.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
I don't know how else to say it.
Wait!
How did you obtain this painting?
He deliberately broke the glass.
He was standing at the street corner.
Do you mind if I turn off the light?
This job is kind of boring.
That's just what I'm going to do.
Don't let me ever catch you doing something like that again.
I am well acquainted with him.
Does Tom have a job?
Do you hear any sound?
Tom mistook me for my brother.
Are you accusing me of cheating?
If you touch that wire, you'll get a shock.
Try to stay awake.
I've never trusted him and I never will.
Machines may one day think, but they'll never laugh.
She is stubborn.
Can we get started now?
I was alone.
How many men named Tom do you know?
He wants to marry my daughter.
That song reminds me of my childhood.
Call me at the office.
Could you show me the way to the station?
I need something else.
Tom gave Mary half of the apple.
If you can't have children, you could always adopt.
How long does it take by car?
I just don't feel that way about you.
Admission is free for children.
I don't know how Tom found out.
We're not from around here.
It may rain tomorrow.
My father is in his room.
Tom is talking.
We could see enemy ships on the horizon.
A number of tickets are sold in advance.
None of them is alive.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
Don't open it, please.
All you do is criticize others.
The situation has deteriorated.
I'm not surprised you don't know the answer.
I did it the way he told me to.
He got up early so he'd be in time for the train.
We're all unique.
Eat whatever you like.
Times have changed.
I hate this apartment.
I am more beautiful than you.
That should be enough.
It will grow old.
I'm prepared.
This is required.
Did anybody call on you yesterday?
Are you afraid of me?
Let's talk over a cold beer.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
Tom is watching golf.
Eating yogurt with a fork is somewhat difficult.
I lied to you the other night.
She gets hives when she eats eggs.
Tom is chubby.
They all died.
I don't see what's changed.
Is that you?
Be respectful.
Don't you have a sense of justice?
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
Tom was alive.
What did I get?
The tiger was killed.
Tom is obviously worried.
He made no reply.
He can speak a little English.
I don't think we should drink this water.
I suppose you're hungry.
Tom is really acting strange.
It was a stroke of genius.
We don't have the same values.
I've forgotten.
You can't keep talking to me like this.
No one seems to know the answer.
France was at war with Russia.
I want you to come work here at our company.
He is a true gentleman.
I can't believe we won.
You go on without me.
You must meet with her.
He looks very worried.
See you all tomorrow.
Tom and Mary raised three children.
Keep this window closed.
I know it's a lie.
The roses in my garden are beautiful.
He looks suspicious.
We don't want to give too much away.
You still haven't told me who he is.
Which CD do you want to listen to?
I have to take an exam.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
It's still early. We should all just chill for a bit.
Do you have a copy?
He got a broken jaw and lost some teeth.
I had a feeling you would be late.
Go home now.
It's easy money.
Did you see him go out?
I caught my finger in the door.
The check, please.
I've come to speak with you.
The meeting finished at nine.
I'm tired of Boston.
Words hurt more than fists.
This car is easy to handle.
I just don't know what to do.
I have amnesia.
A cup of tea, please.
I can't do anything.
Nobody had ever heard of it.
It works like magic.
Please leave.
I'm not a thief.
He was petting the dog.
I can't tell you yet.
I kept the seat warm for you.
I'm yours.
I think Tom wants more.
Look at this.
I'll pack.
Those shoes won't do for climbing.
I've painted the ceiling.
He was robbed of his youth.
I haven't tried.
I don't lend my books to any of the students.
The top spun perilously close to the edge of the table.
There's a problem with the plane's landing gear.
You're the laziest person I know.
I'm just trying to make a buck.
I put some cookies on the table and the kids ate them right up.
Would you care for more coffee?
She flatters herself by thinking that she is beautiful.
She does not like him.
I was late for the meeting because of a traffic jam.
Turn up the volume.
Have you tried Japanese beer?
The teacher is strict with his students.
I want for you and me to be happy.
He works as a ghost writer.
How are things coming along?
I love this group.
No one has yet found the fountain of youth.
I have no desire to understand what goes on inside your head.
I think Tom is in love.
Could you get me another beer?
Pay at the cash register.
I have a week to do my homework.
I let them go.
Why don't you run for student council?
I'm sort of tired.
I'm afraid this key does not fit.
It's not a gift.
My car is parked outside.
I've never told anyone that.
My sister married her high school classmate.
We're a married couple.
I live in the city.
Nobody had to tell Tom. He already knew.
She showed me her room.
I have no religion.
We don't have a problem.
I don't want anything happening to you.
Cats are smarter than you think.
I feel like another person.
I love you the most.
Don't act surprised.
I did warn you.
Tom, are you a dog person or a cat person?
I've been asked to become the manager.
What's the matter with you?
I really don't know where to start.
I'm trying not to cry.
How did you find us?
Have you already spent the money Tom gave you?
I've been watching you study.
Tom was in love.
I returned the knife which I had borrowed.
Just follow your heart.
A bird can glide through the air without moving its wings.
Anything you say may be used against you.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
I was very glad to hear the news.
You don't have to pay.
Mixing with people at a party can be terrifying for shy people.
That is no business of yours.
How much did it cost us?
She has a natural talent for music.
He always leaves home at seven.
You will soon get well.
She was never disrespectful to me.
I hate myself.
You're probably too young to understand what is likely to happen next.
I figured it would be easy to do.
The American flag has fifty stars.
Basho was the greatest poet.
I'm familiar with the situation.
How's your kid doing?
This film is a masterpiece.
Did anyone else feel that?
It's bad weather, to be sure, but we've seen worse.
He went out the window.
Tom knows how to repair computers.
City life suits me very well.
We shook nuts from the tree.
You must gather further information.
Get your clothes on.
I also wanted to know.
Tom is trying to learn French.
I'm not apologizing.
Where's the oar?
Don't you think this suits me?
He asked her some questions.
Japan is made up of volcanic islands.
When did you hear the sound?
When did you buy it?
There is a dog on the bridge.
I thought you'd left.
We're old friends.
I am tired of listening to his long speech.
I need a bigger challenge.
The weather has improved.
I had nothing to do with that problem.
Please give me a sheet of paper.
Is there anyone in the room?
Why are you crying?
What do firefighters do when there are no fires?
Tom needs help now.
That would be unfortunate.
We aren't related.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
I think we all know what's happening.
What's this really about?
I figured I'd find you here.
I want to join you.
You have to tighten those screws.
I don't think children should drink beer.
She's the most popular girl in the class.
I figured you must be hungry by now.

You're not alone.
You should have done it with us.
You're talkative.
I'd like to help you reach your goals.
Do not interfere!
I think this machine is in need of repair.
All this bickering is starting to fray my nerves.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Has Tom been fired?
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
She asked me what had become of him, but I didn't know.
It's not as easy as you think.
Tom got up and walked to the door.
Did you do your work?
He came back from China.
Will you join us?
Why does everyone hate me?
Miniskirts have been out of date for some time.
Now I'll add the finishing touch.
That's something of an understatement.
This is where I brought my girlfriend on our first date.
I didn't understand what was happening.
I know who's pulling the strings.
He showed me the ropes.
That house is for rent.
We are going to have a meeting here tomorrow.
Tom could no longer control himself.
Fur provides animals protection against the cold.
Can you recommend a place to stay in London?
Why did you turn away when you met him?
There's no coffee.
You look smart.
We all have jobs to do.
They won.
Spanish is spoken in most countries of South America.
Please bring me the book next time you come.
Do you have paper?
You continue making the same mistakes time after time.
It was a revelation to me.
That car belongs in a museum.
He doesn't know how to write a letter in English.
I'll invite whoever wants to come.
She is always finding fault with her husband.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
I never thought about it that way.
I'm delighted to meet you.
He's not a very meticulous guy.
You need to save the princess.
He speaks English fluently.
I'm not a good liar.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't love him anymore.
I'm no match for you.
Are you joking?
What time does your class end?
Every man has his price.
Stay with us for a few days.
You should be a writer.
I don't actually believe that.
There wasn't much traffic.
There he is.
You want me to show you how to do it?
I advise you to be punctual.
Get me another lawyer.
She hasn't cleaned her room yet.
Has anyone ever broken your heart?
Tom got into the cab.
Will you have another cup of tea?
I lost my way in the forest.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Don't take any chances.
If you are not satisfied with your share, I'll make it a bit more attractive.
I want to write this down.
I'd like to make myself useful.
This is how I made it.
What did you do this time?
Make him work for it.
You should have consulted me first.
Tom can speak French.
May I tell you a little secret?
You look surprised.
I lost my job on Monday.
You're out of control.
Is Tom drunk?
It's all the rage.
They are probably all dead now.
We should do better.
You aren't allowed to park there.
I shouldn't have to tell you to do your homework.
We were all devastated.
She talked childishly.
We're getting nowhere.
The tea is hot.
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
You've been suspended.
He asked that we be silent.
He is not what he was.
That cost me a lot in the long run.
I took Tom to the hospital.
All of a sudden the sky became overcast.
This road goes to the park.
Please read after me.
We'll think about it in due time.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
It's not worth worrying about it.
I just miss him.
That's what I like to do.
What did he do after that?
I need a breather.
Are you studying chemistry?
You must find work.
I want something to write on.
I'd like a raise.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
How many teams are there?
You're so talented.
Please come to my office in the afternoon.
I thought you were older than me.
There's been an accident.
You will know soon enough.
Tom needs open heart surgery.
I expect a subway station will be here in the future.
Don't you want to come along?
We see him every day.
Thanks for your quick answer.
There's no one but me here.
Nothing could stop him.
I have two jobs.
Explain that to me.
Do you translate lyrics?
He believes in Santa Claus.
You can take either book.
Please do not enter the room without knocking.
There is an urgent need for shelter.
Are you through with the newspaper?
Give me a glass of water, please.
Give me your keys.
You can't just not pay someone for work you hired them to do.
The governor cut the tape and opened the new bridge.
I feel like I'm making progress.
I told you it was dangerous.
I wanted to show it to you.
Does this mean what I think it means?
I think you're drunk.
I blew on my hands to warm them.
It's all mine.
This summer is incredibly hot.
Everyone waited.
In short, all our efforts resulted in nothing.
The streets in Tokyo are full on Saturdays.
I don't usually write this kind of song.
They didn't so much as hint at it.
I had something planned.
Help us.
Tom left Mary alone in the car.
If you don't go, I won't, either.
How did you learn to speak French so well?
That's not your fault.
I just want to know what I'm getting involved with.
I had a crush on you when we were in high school.
I get along well with my neighbors.
What do you desire?
Tom comforted Mary.
Just don't drop it.
I think you'd better give up.
I can't kiss you now.
You had better go.
I'll get them.
I've done some things I'm not proud of.
We must study English.
Hey, don't touch anything!
I never imagined meeting you here.
You were drunk last night, weren't you?
The man aimed a gun at the policeman.
I am not used to being spoken to in that rude way.
You should not go alone.
Do you mind if I get started?
I had a dream about him.
Did you have a good sleep?
Almost everything has gotten better.
If you don't want to talk about it, that's okay.
What is it that you want me to do?
He put the skis on top of the car.
I've made lots of friends.
I wish you hadn't told me.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
You don't give up too easily, do you?
No one else laughed.
She looks unhappy.
Try to control yourselves.
There's no point in waiting.
He likes to just sit around and play video games all day.
After breakfast, we went out for a walk.
She told me everything.
You can leave the room now.
I'm already married.
I saw her last week.
He's kind of shy.
I don't know what I was thinking.
We went due north.
I had my car stolen last night.
Do you wear a kimono?
He went upstairs to her room.
All you have to do is to join us.
Could you please fix this?
Tom likes making paper airplanes.
Did you really do that?
Do it yourself.
It is not his business.
You're very attractive.
The eggs are still hot.
She could not get over her husband's death.
Exams are right after summer vacation.
She's too old for you.
I found it difficult to put it into practice.
No matter how fast you may walk, you can't catch up with him.
I wish you had come with us.
I have no idea where I am.
That's the problem with doing things your way.
I really can't be late.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
She pleaded with him to stay.
We had no drinking water.
This place is all right.
I'm wasted.
That's what makes me nervous.
That's not your job.
We've just spent two weeks apart.
I took him out for a walk.
I rang the doorbell.
I can't believe I won.
Tom volunteered.
She must be forty or so.
He is second to none when it comes to debating.
I really appreciated your help yesterday afternoon.
Ten people were injured in the accident.
I was thinking about getting a divorce.
The wind has died down.
You must have thought of something.
I can do it if you give me a chance.
This problem may be solved in a variety of ways.
It's better to be crazy than to be boring.
Life is not perfect.
Can I see you a second?
I shouldn't have gone there by myself.
I do hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
All the money put together still won't be enough.
He can't handle it.
I wasn't drunk.
How do you live like this?
Tom got these tickets for free.
Is it done?
You're not upset, are you?
I don't know whether it is true or not.
It rained hard yesterday.
I want them.
His doctor ordered him to rest.
He blackmailed me.
I was only saying my prayers.
You should follow Tom's example.
If you add one hundred to one thousand, you get eleven hundred.
Is this a compliment?
He was regarded as a hero.
I'll wait like the rest of you.
We don't have to go.
I have something to show you.
I realized I couldn't win.
Sorry, we're full today.
I had my hair cut at a barber's shop.
We are not too young to tell what love is like.
I feel like I'm in a dream.
I would just like to thank all of you for your work.
The noise was so loud that it was a nuisance to the neighbors.
How much is the car that you're planning to buy?
I was quite at a loss for words.
They said you were fired.
Do you live alone?
Why didn't you call me up?
How far away do you think that ship is?
Don't forget to call your mom.
I have made many sacrifices for my country.
We can all walk home.
Don't take his remarks too literally.
I am American.
Stay with me.
Do you play any instruments?
I walked 10 kilometers today.
I like that tie of yours.
I did warn you.
What are some foods you usually eat with chopsticks?
A unicycle has only one wheel.
I know you did that.
Guess what I found on the beach.
For now, I'd like to concentrate on this.
What're you doing today?
Tom seems courteous.
I like English very much.
I begin tomorrow.
I'm only going to say this once, so you better listen.
I'm wondering if I love her.
First of all, I'm very worried about my daughter's health.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
That's what I told them.
Fill the bucket with water.
He went out in the rain.
She made a mess of the work.
Have you finished reading that novel?
I must've been dreaming.
Maybe I'm going through a midlife crisis.
He banged his head.
I'm playing a TV game.
Do these paintings appeal to you?
You can only come to China if you’ve got a visa.
This increase in unemployment is a consequence of the recession.
I wish you'd called first.
This is a lion.
I just feel a little dizzy.
There are lots of animals in the park.
I need some mental stimulation.
She wrote a book about the bird.
He kept staring at me.
This is your only chance.
I don't care if our team wins or not.
Something you should know about me is that I'm very much a country boy at heart.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
He's the most likely to succeed.
It was only yesterday that I realized what she really meant.
He is quite a gentleman.
I need new shoes.
A third of the earth's surface is desert.
What kind of ranch did you grow up on?
What're you doing about this?
I play a little guitar.
You may use my typewriter.
Have you figured out the cost?
The risk is too great.
I'm looking for my cellphone.
There is no one there.
Open your book to page ten.
I'm too tired to think.
You shouldn't read people's private letters without permission.
Aren't you thirsty?
The result remains to be seen.
I was caught in a shower on my way home from school.
After using the knife, please be sure to put it back where it was.
I'm not driving anywhere.
Tom listened.
This doesn't make much sense, does it?
Your examination results are excellent.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
Tom tried to sleep.
She ordered the book from London.
It's a strange one.
I thought you wouldn't like it.
What have you come here for?
What happened to that friend of yours that you introduced me to last weekend?
Why don't you just buy a new one?
He replied that he knew nothing about it.
Tie your shoe.
Brothers should not quarrel.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
I've been impressed with Tom's work.
They agree.
I am ready to help you.
I've heard it before.
We were wasted.
You must not touch the paintings.
I would rather stay at home.
It may possibly be fine tomorrow.
Am I dying?
You're not very good.
Introduce me to your friend over there.
They love their children.
He is the chosen one.
Some people in the crowd fired back.
They look healthy.
I can't remember very much.
Are you still mad at me?
We're going to another party after this one.
I hope everything will turn out well in the end.
I tried to act natural.
I was eating dinner then.
Are you homeless?
Try it again.
The real heroes are us.
He never breaks promises.
This is for you.
Was anyone in the room?
We're all together right now.
She tried to lift the box, but found it impossible to do.
She demanded to see the manager.
We reached the top of the mountain.
Don't try this at home.
We listened carefully in order not to miss a single word.
I slept very well last night.
Moths are attracted by light.
I'm afraid the rumor is true.
Is there a souvenir shop in the hotel?
I can't believe he kissed you.
Factory waste sometimes pollutes our rivers.
I do want to see you.
They're drunk.
Don't make me shoot you.
My skirt is too long.
May we accompany you on your walk?
Maybe it's not as hard as it looks.
Can you tell the difference between an American and a Canadian?
I am very pleased with my new house.
What are the children doing in the garden?
I'm going to the country with my friends.
I wish Tom would hurry.
Notice the hands of the people you meet and you will be surprised to see how different and how interesting they are.
I think you went too far.
We set up the tent next to the river.
Give me a second.
They may leave tomorrow.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
I don't recognize over half of these names.
I needed to meet you.
We cried together.
Are you going to go with me or not?
I never promised you anything.
Keep quiet.
I find her opinions odd but interesting.
Someone knocked on the door.
Why is he busy?
There is no knowing when a severe earthquake will happen in Tokyo.
As soon as I have it, I'll forward it to you.
You're amusing.
Tom left.
We'll get a keg of beer for the party.
Do the police have any suspects?
The cat is black.
She was kissed by him.
It's a very simple process.
Tom thanked the chef.
You shouldn't have followed me.
You can't handle it.
Are you up?
This nation's economy is growing by leaps and bounds in recent years.
There used to be an art museum in this neighborhood.
Countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
I'm glad you brought this up.
You're not old enough to drink.
Tom doesn't really like Mary, even though he says he does.
I was unprepared.
I just want you to know I'm sorry.
The boy playing the guitar is my brother.
I was naive.
Could you speak more slowly, please?
What's the point of not eating?
Is it you?
You should work in the interests of humanity.
Be more careful from now on.
Take a bite.
I don't know what this is about.
Stay awake.
It is a pity that he can't come.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
I fell into the water.
There is a boy near the door.
How come you didn't call me last night?
You're very wise.
I'm no longer angry at you.
We're about the same age.
I sure do hope so.
How about calling it a day?
I have to take medicine.
Do you love music?
Tom didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French.
I want an attorney.
She was pleased with the gift.
She is very shy and feels ill at ease at parties.
I really need you.
Have you ever seen her?
Let's take up this matter after lunch.
Does Tom have a beard?
I simply wanted to see what was going on.
May I begin by thanking every one for your warm welcome?
We should call the police.
The parents succeeded in calming him down.
Tell me the truth.
I want for you and me to be happy.
Why didn't you tell me?
We'll keep in touch.

Japan has undergone a drastic change as a result of industrialization.
Let me try something.
Follow that car.

Maybe it was just a coincidence.
Put everything in my basket.
It's for my family.
You can tell me the truth.
That was a problem.
We miss Tom terribly.

He doesn't understand sarcasm.
They clung together for warmth.
It'll come in handy.
Can you help me on this one?

I want you to be with me.
The days are growing longer.
This child believes that the earth is flat.
Do you mean to tell me you can't find one?

Why are you so scared to talk to him?
Tom loves Mary, but she doesn't love him.
The bill, please.
Tom and Mary know the truth.
Tell Tom what Mary told you.

The job comes with a lot of fringe benefits.
Are you two going out together?
I won't have to leave work early.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
I've got places to go.
Do you charge for delivery?
One of the windows was broken.
I let my friend copy my homework.
I like to swim.
You're very flexible.
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him.
I know I'm not the brightest girl in the world.
Tom is kidding.
It's getting colder and colder.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
I have read that story in some book.
If you had a million dollars, what would you do?
Water pollution is another problem.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
I hope you're well paid.
I didn't mean to insult you.
Please show it to me again.
I'll paint the house.
Nobody tells the truth anymore.
He wants you to come home.
He is good at playing tennis.
You were perfect.
We've got to find Tom before he does something stupid.
I'm not getting involved.
I think you owe me an explanation.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
He is planning to develop his business.
It's getting ridiculous.
He brought food to his guest and provided him shelter.
I thought you were injured.
She accused him of being inattentive to her.
She helped cook lunch.
These questions can be answered quite simply.
What time will you go home today?
What does it involve?
Do you get many visitors?
You must be exhausted.
No matter who says so, I can't believe that.
Motorcycles are very cheap.
You weren't serious, were you?
They have enough money.
I'll bring you the bill immediately.
We are going to visit our aunt next Sunday.
You're such an idiot!
I want to sleep a little more.
You should relax a bit.
The doctor's office is on the second floor.
She's not prettier than her mother.
Try to remain calm.
Why do people dye their hair?
It's too late for apologies.
Tom lost hope.
There is no grass on the moon.
Tom died at a very old age.
Please stop.
I felt I just had to get off the ship.
This is all that's left.
Give it back to me!
If you want to become thin, you should cut back on the between-meal snacks.
I'm from out of town.
What are you doing in here?
She can't tell right from wrong.
He's such a jerk.
Won't you have some cake?
Are you ready now?
You will find this lesson easy.
Sweating allows the human body to regulate its temperature.
What is the title of the book?
I thought Tom would ask Mary to go with him to Boston.
Can you tell me a little about yourself?
I think Tom is going to die.
They calmed down.
Let's continue.
Tom looks intrigued.
I'm all packed and ready to go.
You could've been hurt.
I only wish I could see you more often.
We'll start.
Tom disagreed.
He is Canadian.
I'd like something to drink.
He began his meal by drinking half a glass of ale.
I regret not having studied hard for the test.
It's a matter of vital importance.
I like your car.
You should take a vacation.
They need him.
The blossoms will be out in a few days.
You're first.
We must abandon ship.
I'd like to have my hair trimmed.
Did I really say that?
You're very stylish.
He knows what he's talking about.
I know they are in love with each other.
The cola made my tongue tingle.
What's the weather like in Boston?
My father is rich.
I have to get up quite early tomorrow.
I feel sympathy for people with that disease.
Where would you like to go next?
Stop me if you can.
It is likely to be fine.
You can't stay in here all day.
We still have some work to do.
You came at just the right time.
I've never felt so good in my life.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
I thought that was your job.
You cannot be too careful about spelling.
Don't say a word to anyone.
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
Don't push your luck.
I wish I could go with you today.
I'll give it a try.
Don't move until I tell you to.
They will keep their promise.
Why are you alone?
This book is worth reading.
You're still too young to get a driver's license.
You can't hold me responsible.
I don't quite know how it happened.
You're not yourself today.
Between you and me, Tom's idea doesn't appeal to me very much.
Stay in bed.
He regularly trains with bodybuilding equipment.
Have there been any signs of the missing children?
Can you ride a horse?
I was dialing his number just as he walked through the door.
No sooner had he said it than he was sorry.
I had no idea you could speak French so well.
Where did you grow up?
All the floors in her house are made of wood.
I would like the least expensive one.
Do you want to ask me a question?
Please feel free to ask questions.
I've been there once.
I admire your dedication.
It was just a passing infatuation.
Can you move this desk by yourself?
We will begin the party when he comes.
I ought to have consulted my parents on the matter.
There's always a first time for everything.
I think that this was not a wise decision.
Stay calm and do your best.
I've got a plan.
I'll try to remember that.
There's no need to be rude.
What number bus do I take?
You can sleep on the couch.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Have you ever been in love?
We must concentrate on that.
Do you have something to show me?
I like to walk in the rain.
What was he up to?
You may be right.
Are you in danger?
He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him.
Would you please stop pacing around like that and just sit down for a second?
My hard drive is almost full.
We must leave here at once.
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs.
She crouched down by the gate.
Why don't you talk to us now?
You look like you're about to throw up.
You'd like Tom.
Did you fall in love with her at first sight?
You should do that soon.
Have you prepared everything for tomorrow?
I was expecting it!
We often played chess after school.
This book has a number of mistakes, but it's interesting.
Tom sat behind his desk.
It was the great lung-power of Caruso that made him a great singer.
She deserved it.
So long.
The man blushed like a boy.
It is beyond my power.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
The policeman promised to investigate the matter.
They're too fat.
That is the girl whose father is a doctor.
I want to get this done today.
I had some engine trouble yesterday.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
It's not safe here.
Do it again!
I can't say I'm sorry.
May I have your name and address?
Did you enjoy yourself?
We're past that.
That's not the only problem.
He is always saying bad things about others.
Hunger is the best sauce.
That made me very sad.
You're not supposed to be in here.
I will come, weather permitting.
He is learning how to drive a car.
This is no accident.
No one ever comes here.
We have to work hard to fix this problem.
I remember everything you tell me.
How about having a drink after we finish our work today?
I can't lend this book to you.
Your answer is to the point.
I think you deserve this.
An apple fell off the tree.
That's all over now.
The pain was excruciating.
You disgust me.
Why is the sky blue?
I am in trouble.
He will do anything to make money.
It looks like rain.
You run.
It's very interesting.
I have a burning pain here.
It can't be that simple.
Tell Tom we're waiting for him.
Come here, all of you.
He is good at cooking.
You look as healthy as ever.
I can't drink any more beer.
The phone doesn't work right now.
I want some milk.
A guard's been killed.
You can help.
Tom doesn't dress like everybody else.
Tom is taking care of the kids.
All my stuff is here.
I don't expect you to understand this.
Can you wake me up at 7:00 tomorrow?
I feel terrible about ruining your party.
I hate when this happens.
An elderly person was resting under a tree.
I hate my computer.
He decided to go to Paris for the purpose of studying painting.
I'm not sure anymore.
I think it's time for me to close the window.
It's extremely unfair.
"I am not tired." "Neither am I."
Tom looks sick.
One of your neighbors complained.
How can you not know?
You like elephants.
I'm just tired.
No sooner had he arrived than the bus departed.
I think everybody's tired.
This is not for me.
We're finished.
They met in high school.
Does your school have a library?
I am not accustomed to making speeches in public.
I really love you.
She invited us to her birthday party.
This bird can imitate the human voice.
Isn't that enough for you?
You must obey the traffic rules.
Did you hear what we were saying?
The roses in the garden are blooming.
I spend as much time working in the garden in one day as my brother does in a week.
You'd be perfect for that.
If you tell too many lies, people won't ever believe you.
Wash your hands well.
Do you have anything to eat in your pack?
She bought him a camera that was too big to fit in his shirt pocket.
He was also kind to animals.
You're telling me.
He was raised in the United States, but his native language is Japanese.
He is not studying English now.
You should take care of yourself.
Do not call him master.
Come back in a day.
Tom made breakfast for Mary.
We all want you back.
We sent you an email with an activation link.
We can hide in here.
What is that?
The street was bustling with shoppers.
I know how busy you are.
Don't be so careless!
She attacked him with her fists.
Is this your first conference in Paris?
That isn't to my liking.
Who do you know here?
I just want to be clear.
He's my husband.
They started at the same time.
It is getting dark outdoors.
I thought you'd be older.
He always tells the truth.
We don't trust Tom.
Tom is our guest.
I only told you, no one else.
I can't let you go in there alone.
You're free of all responsibility.
I actually never knew that.
The storm blew down a tree.
Can I do this later?
I bought it in a thrift store.
Please be honest.
I have to be careful.
I think you might need my help.
You're aren't one of us.
We're your last hope.
Anyone who protested, lost his job.
Who did you meet?
I read the report you wrote.
You're either with me or you're against me.
I eventually want to be fluent in German.
Is this typewriter yours?
We associate Egypt with the Nile.
The milk went sour.
I was not pleased.
Tom eats very quickly.
No matter what you say, I don't think Tom is a nice guy.
This is a lion.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
I just couldn't do it anymore.
No one is so poor that he cannot afford to be neat.
He parked his car in front of the building.
Ask her what her name is.
We don't have enough beer.
I said not now.
Your parents know where you are.
Do you really want to help?
Tell me what you saw.
How often have you been there?
They're cool.
Let's enjoy the long vacation.
Bring me my cane.
What's the destination of this ship?
I hate to see you like this.
Did you know that some foxes lived on this mountain?
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
You must leave.
You intimidate Tom.
I'll remember you forever.
That's rubbish.
You stick out like a sore thumb.
She is much taller than me.
He may be jogging around the park.
You're going to be a father.
This is how I made it.
I don't take needless risks.
They're arguing.
The result is neither good nor bad.
The doctor examined my throat.
I would like to go to the USA.
I don't talk to them anymore.
A lot of soldiers died here.
I'm ticklish.
I see a bright future for you.
She started at the top.
You can't keep this a secret.
I only wish I were able to help.
You should always tell the truth.
They know him.
He went to bed early.
I am concerned about his health.
You can't just go.
She will become a doctor.
Why would I know that?
She advised him to drink more milk.
I have too many things on my mind these days.
Tom slammed on the brakes.
You should look up that word.
I don't have your courage.
It may rain any minute.
Don't give me that look.
Where's the light switch?
Why are you all so busy?
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
His son is a genius.
He's on his way home.
They cried when they heard the news.
You cannot buy happiness.
I want you back here.
This book is still copyrighted.
I asked him about the accident.
Are you pleased with your new house?
I'm still undecided.
I don't have to do that if I don't want to, do I?
I met him by accident at the airport yesterday.
Shops are quiet on weekdays.
He died from lack of oxygen.
Are you coming in or not?
How do you think it made me feel?
I'll be with you in five minutes.
I want to look like her.
I wonder why Tom left.
Where's my car?
It's not a weapon.
The stock market was surprisingly quiet today.
Please tell me it's crazy.
They accused me of being a liar.
We're out of beer.
You should stop drinking.
Not all English people like fish and chips.
Go home now.
Don't go out after dark.
You're extroverted.
I may be overthinking this.
He dashed out of the store.
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
She tried to persuade him to buy her a pearl necklace.
I am much obliged to you for your help.
I wish you could come with us.
You're very funny.
What do you say?
No matter how hard the training was, she never cried.
I meet him at the club.
She bought a chicken.
I was late for the appointment.
He is accustomed to working hard.
A couple of flights were delayed on account of a minor accident.
I thought I heard you.
I'm fairly busy, actually.
He asked for a pay raise.
That will please my father.
I want these people out of here.
I saw a flock of sheep.
I need you to fix this.
Someone is standing behind the bushes taking pictures of us.
I want you back here.
Talk to me.
You have gone too far this time.
How long have you waited?
I looked in my closet for something to wear.
Can I pay later?
I'll give it to you.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
I guess I was mistaken.
He speaks English.
How are things going with your youngest sister?
Every student was asked one question.
They are my friends.
Tell me what you want.
Children want to act like grown-ups.
I'm very glad to see you again.
It's not us who did it.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
Put it on my account.
Have you read today's paper?
I haven't gotten rid of my bad cold yet.
I was beaten.
Who's your favorite actor?
Bilingual dictionaries are allowed.
Can I leave now?
You've betrayed us.
I have just come back from school.
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
You remember it better than I do.
You should always think before you speak.
Women generally live longer than men.
I just want to win, that's all.
I don't feel like celebrating.
Having finished the work, he went to bed.
You can't blame him.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride in his success.
I made a list of things I needed to do.
That wasn't Tom's choice.
The rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer.
Thousands of people were milling around in the square.
How much for half a kilo?
There is an album on the shelf.
I'm a nice guy.
Why did you side with him instead of me?
He strayed from his group.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
I allowed her to go to the party.
You need someone to help you, don't you?
I don't like bad boys.
A dance will be held on Friday.
I made a huge mistake.
Just say yes or no.
So what's going on?
Is it to go?
He was slain in battle.
Can you imagine what life would be like without television?
I found it easy to find the building.
Use them all.
She has a picture.
It's unlikely.
Were you happy?
It is terribly hot this morning.
Can you read Arabic?
Friends are always willing to help each other.
Is it yours?
You have gone too far.
Tom probably thought I didn't like him.
She has a sharp tongue.
Are you sure?
I thought you were injured.
You have nothing to fear.
My shoulder hurts.
Tom wants children, but Mary doesn't.
Do you want this done quickly or do you want this done right?
He is walking very slowly.
She heard him cry.
He loves traveling.
We have no choice. I guess we'll have to walk.
Tom reads the New York Times.
What else do you have?
This is kind of embarrassing.
The old man attempted to swim five kilometers.
You have no cause for anger.
I don't really know.
They should have the right to decide for themselves.
Tom has a meeting tomorrow.
You can't save me.
Don't be crazy.
We'll all be here for you.
What's the cost?
Is that important?
I don't think I can do this anymore.
I want each of you to take out a piece of paper and write down what happened.
I left my guitar in your office.
Why are there stars in the sky?
Politics leaves him cold.
Please take your time before deciding what to do.
I had nothing to do with this.
I think my German isn't very good.
I'm joking, of course.
Tom dreams of becoming a millionaire.
I've been shopping all day.
Well, let's go.
We had a secret meeting.
It's only money.
I didn't scream.
I can't stop smoking.
She took a flower from the vase and held it out to me.
I haven't had a barbecue for a long time.
He is not wearing a hat.
My younger brother is watching TV.
They all look the same.
We were just about to leave when she telephoned.
You are the one.
We try to explain things across cultures; in spite of boundaries.
She is as tall as you.
What have you done with my luggage?
The government's investment will create many jobs.
Press any key to continue.
I've been riding so long I'm starting to smell like my horse.
She took a sip of her drink.
He intrigues me.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
I spent all day in his house.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Mother Teresa was given the Nobel prize.
I have to write a letter. Do you have some paper?
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
Don't you love me anymore?
Tom needs money for college.
I think that it's dangerous to go walking alone at night.
I mean it!
Would you be friends with me?
That dog is so stupid.
There are few men who don't know that.
Do you know why he wasn't at school?
I can't breathe.
You look surprised.
I have the same trouble as you had.
I know how much you love Tom.
I haven't eaten lunch yet.
Can I have everyone's attention please?
You cannot achieve the impossible without attempting the absurd.
She was busy with the housework.
It was a weird feeling.
Mary has nobody to talk with, but she doesn't feel lonely.
He asked my mother.
I am weighing myself.
I feel bad for them.
You have mail.
I want to know who called.
He invited me to his house.
How much time do you spend on Facebook?
Am I being accused of murder?
I can't tell you what you want to hear.
Would you prefer a window or an aisle seat?
My house is like yours.
Fortunately, the weather was good.
How about going for a walk after lunch?
She acquired a knowledge of French.
Straighten up.
The President spoke to the nation on TV.
I have no religion.
It's not at all impossible.
You can't help yourself.
I really am glad you're here.
I'm running out of closet space.
Does Tom have green eyes?
This book is full of mistakes.
How's your old lady doing?
Do you enjoy living dangerously?
My friends congratulated me on my success.
This is technically impossible.
It was cloudy, with occasional rain.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
You will need an armed escort.
I'm still mad at her.
At any rate, I must finish this work by tomorrow.
We talked about a variety of topics.
Put it there, not here.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
What was Tom's reaction?
This was his one and only hope.
Smoking is bad for your health.
That's clearly not true.
I forgot what his name was.
We had a lot of furniture.
I have everything under control.
How could you help me?
After the hurricane, their house was a wreck.
Come here at exactly six o'clock.
I don't know what to make of this.
The three brothers must help one another.
We've done a lot.
I wonder if we can get in.
Have you gone nuts?
I had a lovely night.
You're so paranoid.
Not a star was to be seen.
I had not waited long before the bus came.
He agreed to give us an interview.
It is too dark for me to read.
He is a jealous man.
I'll join you.
Whose turn is it next?
I am after him.
You're very upset.
I just want my life back.
I've actually heard of this.
I was tired.
That's kind of rare.
It's not safe there.
Don't tell my wife.
I did it without you.
Your paintings are beautiful.
I don't blame you for hitting him.
I sat down next to him.
Quite a few people came to the meeting yesterday.
Shouldn't you take a break?
The driver felt like taking a rest.
I'm shocked.
I have responsibilities.
That sounds very interesting.
I was convicted.
We wasted a lot of time.
I like playing baseball.
It is finally all over.
She divorced her husband.
Life is not all fun and games.
You need someone to help you, don't you?
I hope Tom has fun.
What you need is a friend.
I will wait outside.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
There is more water than is needed.
Is anyone surprised?
You have to memorize this sentence.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
It was a warm summer evening.
Keep this information under your hat.
We've got a bigger problem.
They're coming for us.
Are you happy with the service?
She hasn't heard the news yet.
I don't tolerate incompetence.
I showed him the way.
Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
I don't feel much like laughing.
I appreciate the support.
She explained the matter to me.
I still love you.
Everybody needs one.
Can the lawyer see me on Friday?
Who's the captain of this ship?
I saw him walking around town wearing his Sunday best.
Air is a mixture of various gases.
Are cats smarter than dogs?
I've already drunk half a bottle of wine while I was waiting for you.
I'm giving you one more chance.
He is a bad person.
She has more books.
That school looks just like a prison.
He likes my jokes.
He is busy.
He talks as if he knew everything.
I caught the flu.
Life is not fair. Get used to it.
How do I know you didn't do it?
I'm not selling you my car.
He won't talk to her and she won't talk to him.
Let's see what's in the box.
I had a good coach.
I get bored quickly in everything I do.
I can't budge it.
I appreciate your advice.
That's not what I saw.
I hope not.
I want you to know that Tom's important to me.
The recent frequency of earthquakes makes us nervous.
You must not think about your immediate profit only.
Would you please fill out this form?
I didn't take part in the conversation.
You could've killed somebody.
Let's hurry up.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
It was just a lucky guess.
Are you content with your position in the company?
It's for you to decide.
He was put in a cell.
The book fell to the floor.
She finally reached the hotel.
It's working as intended.
Could I use the phone?
It made me very happy.
I know her address.
There is little money left.
We're positive that they forgot to call us.
Where is the mistake?
Tom left a message.
They're not happy.
Our fighters averaged 430 missions a day.
Keep this information under your hat.
I wish you would do as you're told.
Please don't smoke cigarettes no matter what.
Is the hotel far from here?
You know the drill.
I can't tell you why she was absent from school.
Today is not your day.
She ran over her lines once before she went on stage.
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
He encouraged me to try again.
If your feet get wet, you'll catch a cold.
You can't come with us.
Her cheeks were red.
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
I don't think we should go outside today.
Let's not forget to do that.
I only did it for your own good.
Did anyone see it happen?
I've been dying to see you.
Just don't forget this.
Jump.
My painting is starting to look pretty cool.
There are a lot of poodles under the couch.
Tom had to make a fire.
He's very upset by this.
Talk to me!
We heard what sounded like gunshots.
Don't get me started.
Tom is nervous and excited.
They heard it on the radio.
Everybody in the room let out a sigh of relief.
Someone broke into my house last weekend.
It's useless to talk to Tom.
You should be more careful.
The team waited.
It worked.
That's a good reason, I guess.
Don't hurt anyone.
The war began three years later.
The policeman said that it looked like a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
We must go now.
I can't think of any other plan.
You can always count on me.
They huddled together.
We're done.
A new model isn't necessarily any better than the older one.
What do you want me to do about it?
Let's see what happens.
He didn't know what to say, so he remained silent.
I don't know where I'm going.
You weren't married for long, were you?
The nation needed more and better teachers.
Now drink up.
The door opened and a man walked in.
Christmas is soon, isn't it?
Is there anything you want to add to what I just said?
Try to make it last a little longer.
A car went by at terrific speed.
Many thanks.
I guess my mind just wandered.
I drank some of the milk and kept the rest in the refrigerator.
Tom didn't have anything to say.
Have you been playing basketball all afternoon?
This textbook is written in simple English.
It is too long ago.
I thought you didn't care about money.
My sister is pretty.
I've asked you this question before.
Do you really mean that?
While we're waiting, why don't you tell me what happened?
It's the sort of day when you'd like to stay in bed.
It doesn't work so well because the batteries are running down.
I knew you'd be mad.
I think that's the problem.
Medication and alcohol often don't mix.
She made up her mind to go to college.
I would like to study Arabic.
He became a famous actor.
We have a reservation.
I'm not doing that today.
Tom has done his homework.
That may not be so easy.
His new car is wonderful.
I lived in poverty.
He had his son die last year.
What are you all doing?
Is there a picture of Tom in that album?
Don't you like baseball?
We're not impressed.
He is the son of a wealthy family.
Would you mind my opening the door?
Just out of curiosity, what do you expect to happen?
We will present our idea to the committee.
At last, they came to a decision.
Don't you see what's happened?
Do you recognize anyone?
You swim well, don't you?
I had no idea you were so stupid.
I had a job when I was your age.
A gunshot was heard in the distance.
I don't know what else I could've done.
What did you want to talk to me about?
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
I'm not disagreeing.
Be nice to her.
She bought the dictionary, too.
He complained that he couldn't find a job.
Any improvement is good.
Have you ordered?
Tom doesn't like chess.
I might stay.
We're pretty tight.
Who is your favorite author?
What does that word mean?
How do you feel about gun control?
He's two years older than Mary is.
I just want to be alone.
I was so disappointed.
He took pity on me and helped me out.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
She always urges him to try new things.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Come to think of it, I really need a cellphone.
I can't get along with him.
He's just not the person I thought he was.
I have several silver coins.
She met him on the beach.
I'll leave it up to your imagination.
I awoke from a long dream.
She is poor, but she looks happy.
Everyone, follow me.
He worked far into the night.
He was not happy about it.
Don't touch anything without asking.
Go kiss someone else.
He is said to have been very poor when he was young.
Why don't you help?
The ship ran aground on a sandbar.
We elected her mayor.
We were reading a book and it was a very good one.
She's my friend.
I have three dogs.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Buy it for me, please.
He worked very hard.
I have evidence.
It doesn't hurt.
All we can do is wait for him.
Where are we going to lunch?
Many children stay after school for club activities.
This is ugly.
If you're not happy, quit.
He came back from America.
I do not have the courage to ask my boss to lend me his car.
Are you students at this school?
What time did you get up this morning?
This classroom is very large.
Come to us.
I don't need it back.
What did you get?
She is amusing to be with.
The country declared war against its neighbor.
Do you mind if I use your computer?
The decision whether I should see her is mine alone.
Stop sucking up to the teacher.
Is that your mother?
Come help me.
I'm only going to show you once.
Could you call me tonight, please?
Who put that there?
I don't go to the movies as often as I'd like.
I stopped and waited for the car to pass.
They are looking to you for help.
I arrived at Osaka Station at night.
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.
I went camping with my family.
I'm terrified.
We need a knife for the butter.
Do you want to do it right now?
I went to school.
Charles Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927.
Tom lost his umbrella.
Do you like Wagner?
Do you have a table on the patio?
I can't figure out how to open this suitcase.
She attempted suicide.
I have a dictionary.
Roulette is a game of chance.
He leaped over the shallow ditch.
That's stupid.
Everything matters.
He often eats fish for dinner.
The mother separated the fighting children.
You're preaching to the choir.
You'll all die.
You look great.
Can we get this gate open?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
The higher he rose in social rank, the more modest he became.
He's a southpaw.
He made up his mind to marry her.
Organic food tastes better.
You're quiet.
Be serious.
We have walked all around the lake.
I suggest we leave immediately.
That's not big enough.
I'll hang onto it for now.
It was in Tokyo that I first met her father.
I think that's horrible.
It's the ultimate test.
They were wealthy.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Did Tom call you last night?
They're washing their hands.
My mother gets up early.
Maybe she won't come.
The files are missing.
You're no singer.
I'm a bank clerk.
I waited for a bus to come.
You haven't washed your hands yet, have you?
It cost me ten thousand yen to have my television set repaired.
I don't want a boyfriend.
Did I say too much?
I was afraid of being put into a closet.
I'm really looking forward to my birthday party.
We see what we expect to see.
That's an amazing distance, isn't it?
Drive safely.
This river is deepest here.
Do you have anything cheaper?
I just want to make it up to you.
It was obviously a joke.
I try to please everyone.
They're all watching us.
It's getting cold here.
I'm in the mood to talk now.
I'm obviously very disappointed.
When I grow up, I want to be a king.
You're unforgettable.
Anybody home?
What's your name?
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
For that reason, he lost his job.
Could you check the tire pressure?
There is an apple on the desk.
There's a rumor going around that she got a new job.
You've got to be making this up.
While he was lost in thought, he heard his name called.
He has trouble remembering names.
I bought two cotton shirts.
We're sorry we can't help you.
I think it's about time we got started.
Would you like some more tea?
Tom left Mary a note.
The first attack missed the target.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
What did you open it with?
I don't want to get bogged down in details.
Is eating people wrong?
Families began to have fewer and fewer children.
Are you tired of living?
He won't be pleased.
Tom really wants to lose weight.
They clung together for warmth.
She wrote to him to tell him how wonderful he was.
I have a cat.
How did that whole thing happen?
Who would buy this?
He was very pleased with the result.
Could you give me the name and phone number of a doctor?
A stay of execution was ordered at the eleventh hour.
Are you sure you want to put your life in her hands?
I like being part of this group.
Do you like music?
Read as much as possible.
Someone attacked Tom.
This song was popular in the 1970s.
Has anybody solved this mystery?
I knew I shouldn't have put off doing my homework until the last minute.
She advised him to study harder.
Would you do something for me?
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
I can remember when you were just a little girl.
The accident occurred at dawn.
I want one!
Can I use your pencil?
Most of us are much more interesting than the world suspects.
Do you want a car?
The case is closed.
I will be through with the book in no time.
The streets are flooded.
Who did you see?
He is a physicist.
Tom said that you tried to kill him.
I'm kind of a loner.
Can you show me?
He seemed really nervous.
Are you coming with me?
I dreamed I was in Boston again.
Who taught her how to speak English?
Mary and Alice wore matching outfits.
What exactly are you implying?
Tom began fixing dinner.
I still haven't found anything.
Everyone needs to work together.
The pen has run out of ink.
Bring me a drink.
You've got a pretty good memory.
Do you have a timetable?
He could read me like an open book.
You'd better go.
She is kind to old people.
Tom didn't want Mary to drive drunk.
Those apples are big.
Some students aren't going to come back next semester.
Beware of pickpockets here.
Did I leave anything out?
Do you have any CDs?
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
He went to London in 1970.
He finally made money.
I want to see what I'm up against.
People are sometimes tempted to eat more than they should.
I ate a salad for lunch.
I think I broke his heart.
Tom is better at science than anyone else in his class.
Please book me a room in a first-class hotel.
Stay awake.
Is Mary a real blonde?
He asked a few questions of me.
Nobody was paying attention to her.
He got down on his knees and prayed for the souls of the deceased.
I'm impressed with your French.
Are you both crazy?
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
He will play soccer tomorrow.
You dropped something.
We study French.
This armchair is comfortable to sit in.
Please sum up your idea.
The cellar is ugly, dark, and stinky.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
A driver was sleeping in the car.
I can't let you in there.
We have more to do.
He was so sad that he almost went mad.
You should go to the dentist and have that tooth pulled out.
Tom tried to sleep.
You have many books.
I awoke from a dream.
You've got to be reasonable about this.
Where can I get a ticket?
Did you go to the doctor?
How was your trip to Boston?
His parents hate me.
The man had something under his coat.
My daughter is the apple of my eye.
I'll go next month.
I have tried everything.
I don't know where my French textbook is.
Let's go ahead and eat.
I will wait for you in front of the radio station.
This is my family.
I stayed home for a week.
It is kind of you go out of your way to help me.
You aren't a spy, are you?
I'm not here to fight.
Women like colorful umbrellas.
I won't be needing this.
You should make sure that you get there on time. Tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late.
We ended up not getting there on time.
Since it was already late, I went to sleep.
What are you all doing?
I stepped aside so that he could come in.
He's a crybaby, just like always.
You are early.
Sit wherever you like.
Your friend Tom hasn't returned.
Tom was my cellmate.
I'm crazy.
You're very curious.
This meat smells bad.
Tom was pacing back and forth in the parking lot, waiting for Mary.
My favorite color is red.
This is all very confusing.
Please give me a cup of tea.
Did you get my email yesterday with the instructions?
The stated price does not include labor charges.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
You are trusted by every one of us.
This road leads to the river.
Go grab a drink.
Tom still isn't taking us seriously.
What season do you like the best?
Go back to work.
Is there anybody there?
After a while, he came to.
Tom claims he shot Mary in self defense.
How much is the commission?
I've tried.
I asked him where I should park my car.
The school was established in 1650.
These fireworks are spectacular!
You should've called me.
Please move your bicycle out of here.
As soon as he went out of the house, it began to rain.
I'm not sure about it.
I remember hearing the story once.
This is absolutely wonderful.
They sell that at a hardware store.
Can you read that?
I need guidance.
I want to learn English.
I guess we're finished.
You're very forward.
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
He is extremely pessimistic and has no aspirations.
Are you all right?
Be respectful.
I think you need a lawyer.
I had a situation to take care of.
You can wait for me here.
I have failed.
I should go.
You should know better than to ask a lady her age.
Why do you have to do it?
Be confident.
I made him do so.
What did I ever do to you?
Do you have something to say?
A month has passed and the work has made little progress.
Let go of my arm!
Do you feel like going swimming?
I must destroy you.
Don't you have some work to do?
Tom couldn't find it.
We might be able to help her.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
This doesn't look good at all.
Tell me what you think's inside this box.
Why don't you stay there?
Against all expectations, we became good friends.
Do you know anyone in Australia?
Is this the art department?
Tom's leg is bleeding.
I don't think he was being straight with me.
I am so exhausted!
Let's get out while we can.
They're weak.
I had a drink or two before you came.
His name eludes me.
You need to be more aggressive.
I caught an awful cold.
Can you guess what I have?
Are you up for it?
I had to do my duty.
Tom opened a window.
I used to tell people I knew how to speak French.
I want to be very clear about that.
Has something happened to Tom?
You've got to wait.
Go get your shoes polished.
Why would anyone want to kill me?
How do I make you go away?
I forgot his address.
Am I first?
I don't have all the facts.
Follow that car.
Would you do it with me?
The hero finally defeated the evil scientist.
I met Tom on my way to school.
A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert.
It's easy to cut cheese with a knife.
I have a glass eye.
It gives me the shivers.
I like to play with words.
I just had a talk with your lawyer.
He was a wonderful man.
Are you registered?
He has never played golf.
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea.
I can't see the stage well from this seat.
Christmas is soon.
Let's just not talk anymore.
We have no school tomorrow.
I hope this is worth it.
Try not to disappoint me.
We surrendered.
Tom waited outside in the pouring rain for over an hour.
I need the following items.
We took turns cleaning the room.
I think Tom is a little too optimistic.
He was beaten too easily.
I didn't do anything.
I loved it.
The talk was peppered with scientific jargon that no one understood.
He couldn't help laughing at it.
It's worse than I thought.
What did the doctor say?
You have little to gain and much to lose.
They missed the deadline.
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
They got into the train.
You must stick to your diet.
She is just a wallflower.
He has a perfect command of English.
He promised not to tell that to anyone.
I apologized profusely.
I never liked school.
That's enough.
My son loves to throw temper tantrums in the supermarket.
He came to see me.
It's never too late.
The house was in flames.
I think it's time to go home.
You don't have to apologize.
Is tomorrow a holiday?
It's fun to learn a foreign language.
Tom doesn't even live in Boston.
I'm not offended.
Was anybody with you?
How do they want to receive their money?
Every time I see this photo, I think of my father.
The film I told you about has been released.
I can't believe you.
That house is big.
Can you do it faster?
Schools are closed for Christmas.
We sat in lawn chairs and stared at the mountain.
I regret to say he's gone for good.
Tom isn't going to listen to me.
I've always been a hard worker.
I don't want any ice cream.
I can't believe you actually did something like that.
Many improvements have been made since this century began.
My girlfriend often cuts my hair.
Do you like black cats?
How did you get to be a cop?
This is mine.
Get out of my bed.
He tucked the handkerchief in his pocket.
I will go there on foot or by bicycle next time.
I want to learn karate.
The baby takes after his mother.
Do you have a few CDs?
I figured a change of scenery might do us good.
He was more than a king.
We are free from danger.
I don't like your taste in color.
What's worrying you?
I felt a little stiff.
I like opera.
What are you going to do next?
This bicycle belongs to me.
It's morally repugnant.
The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.
Tom seems happy.
I'm really proud of this.
They're just students.
Thank you in advance.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
I think we should leave now.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I'm a very lucky man.
Apart from a couple of early setbacks, the project is progressing well.
He came several times.
She can't stop me.
How much more suffering can they endure?
It looked funny.
I'm tired of Boston.
They did not feel like playing any more.
Can't you speak English?
Get out of here, all of you!
I wasn't going to give up.
What would I do if something happened to you?
Everyone is more or less interested in art.
I have no more than one thousand yen.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
He's too old for her.
Are you hurt anywhere?
She heard him sing.
Which meat dishes do you propose?
Tom often comes here.
Who did it?
Which student went out?
Parents need to set the rules around the house.
He sold all that he owned.
You need to do this.
Maybe you'd better come with us.
This whole affair stinks to high heaven.
I can't go back there and neither can you.
I will go.
He needed the money.
I didn't expect to see you at a place like this.
Japan depends on foreign trade.
Don't ever make me wait again.
I don't know exactly where.
Will she forgive him for forgetting her birthday?
They could not find work at home.
It had snowed.
The days are getting warmer and warmer.
Young people must respect the law.
She gave me some practical advice.
Printing ink is in short supply.
I wasn't involved.
This smell disgusts me.
She went shopping elsewhere.
I'll start.
My little sister is kind of lazy.
I had some things to do before the meeting.
We should hang out sometime.
I wish I could speak English.
Some of them are my friends.
I know it was you.
I'm not used to this heat.
We'll cooperate.
She is friendly to everybody.
When was this temple built?
There are some things that I don't understand.
We're up against the wall.
I think you might be overreacting.
I know what you are thinking.
I didn't understand this joke.
Please bring me a clean knife.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
We can't go.
Look up the words in your dictionary.
I knew this would be hard for you.
You needed me.
What does that tell us?
This is the watch that I bought yesterday.
He is a member of the committee.
I know you hired a lawyer.
Tom left some dirty dishes in the sink­.
Don't be so lazy.
I'll be back in two hours.
Make a sketch of your house.
Everybody breaks this law.
Your sudden appearance surprised me.
Why did you buy flowers?
This dress is much too large for me.
He is sitting cross-legged.
It's a dead-end relationship.
I'd say you did well.
They hate us.
Everyone looked relieved.
I must make an apology to her.
I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope.
Get out of here immediately!
We should have departed earlier.
We must keep a diary every day.
I don't have a choice.
I like to dress this way.
I could help.
I don't see why Tom wanted me to be here today.
Did you write down the number?
I have to go.
Speak into the microphone.
Tom took more than one picture, didn't he?
They worked through the night.
The company was started with $100,000 in capital.
The light is out.
We bought bread and milk.
He's your son.
If any harm comes to her, I will hold you personally responsible.
I'd like to know more about it.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
There is no one there.
I want to share it with you.
Would you put out the candles?
You're not helping much.
The people are friendly here.
I think you're being a little too careful.
I am sure.
Tom must be tired now.
Does anyone here speak Japanese?
You are, hands down, the biggest idiot I've ever met.
I don't plan on telling you anything.
You'll be asked why you want to be a teacher.
My wife is always complaining about something.
What a tragedy!
I'd like to file a complaint.
Tom is three years older than you.
She writes to her son from time to time.
He stopped smoking last year.
The dog stopped barking.
I'll keep it a secret. Don't worry.
Did you meet her?
Tom was screaming at Mary.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
Finally, I have my own car.
She asked him to help her father clean the garage.
I wish I had married her.
I want to talk to you about tomorrow.
Her story turned out to be true.
Which is your luggage?
It is about ten minutes' walk to the station.
I doubt if he is a lawyer.
Am I supposed to thank you?
She asked him where he lived.
It's so strange.
He is a good student.
I dream about you quite often.
I feel a lot safer now.
They're all watching TV.
Give it up.
Well, I must be going.
The baby cried.
Do it when you have time.
Sorry for not answering your question. I didn't see it.
Were you able to solve the problem?
These books are heavy.
Do the new neighbors have any kids?
Everybody sat down.
Can you think of anything else?
They're going to make mistakes.
She wanted to travel.
Tom's adopted.
If you have time, let's go shopping.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
He asked her out on a date.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
I want to know what I'm buying.
Is it genuine?
That's all I have left.
It certainly looks like rain.
I bought a book of folktales.
Are you on crack?
He's a cheat and a liar.
Tom retired earlier this year.
We're done here.
She wants to extend the no-smoking area.
I am glad that you have succeeded.
Snow reminds me of my hometown.
A dry spell accounts for the poor crop.
The surgeon forgot something inside the patient.
I can't really describe it.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
I feel like being alone.
Many young people in Japan eat bread for breakfast.
The plan has been successful so far.
I have something for you, too.
I'm on my way to work.
I need some water.
"Do you speak German?" "No, I don't."
Which of these rackets is yours?
She tried to lower her expenses.
The bakery is located next to the butcher shop.
How much is the monthly rate?
The only golden rule is that he who has the gold makes the rules.
Overcooked fish can be dry and tasteless.
The sisters hate each other.
We found one large footprint and a couple of different size smaller footprints.
His name sounds familiar.
Gradually the true meaning of what he said began to dawn on me.
I feel inclined to agree with her.
I am leaving Japan tomorrow morning.
This will help keep you warm.
Tom seems to be nervous.
The dirty boy turned out to be a prince in disguise.
Could you please tell me again why you are late?
His heart was beating wildly.
Let no one escape.
What do you think of his suggestion?
Taiwanese food is milder than Indian food.
I wasn't kidding.
Tom can't do the job.
I'm very thirsty.
Everything is over.
I'd like to see that ring, please.
It's not going to end well.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
My tummy hurts.
Tom's famous.
Aren't you glad you didn't go to Boston?
I know who killed my parents.
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
He likes fishing.
Are you quite certain about it?
Don't you just hate technology?
We should have been more careful.
That bus stops in front of my house.
I should be happy.
What a woman!
Do you want him to know about it?
I've got to get going.
They made sure nobody could see them.
The police set out to solve the crime.
I was pleasantly surprised.
I have to go to bed.
I'm nervous when speaking in another language.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
The hawk caught a mouse.
I won't repeat anything you say to me.
May I have the check, please?
Are you willing to make a deal?
I know you have a girlfriend.
Are you good at cooking?
What can all that mean?
Do you think students are given enough time to eat lunch?
Many flights were canceled because of the typhoon.
I'm beginning to get curious.
The universe is endless.
Don't run risks.
Who volunteered?
Will it be necessary for us to buy a book for this class?
What did it look like?
She realized that she had better tell the truth.
Write in the date yourself.
Tom is a very creative person.
I know you have a girlfriend.
I guess I'd better be going.
I saw many people who had no clothes and I saw many clothes which had no people in them.
Don't forget your stuff.
They used truth serum.
I want to know who threw the first punch.
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
She picked up the phone.
We had a lunch date, didn't we?
How's your mother?
Our army attacked the enemy during the night.
I can't continue to ignore the problem.
This is what you're supposed to do.
Just act as if nothing has happened.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
We're saved.
It's difficult to transplant an old tree.
When did you start learning German?
There must be a pattern.
I need a few more days.
Tom knew Mary had kissed John.
Is your father a doctor?
Does anybody know about this?
Tom saw that Mary was busy.
Honesty is one of the most beautiful things in the world.
Do you have a hobby?
Can you help me a little?
What if we should fail?
I really like being with you.
I'm not strong.
I have to speak with you immediately.
He denied the rumor.
Where do you all come from?
Tom has money. However, he's not all that happy.
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
How to meet future energy demand is a big question we must consider.
I'd like to have some hot chocolate.
That store gives good service.
We must do it again.
I think Tom can do that.
Can you forget your native language?
It's rude to point at anyone.
Anybody hurt?
Watch your step.
I have problems concentrating.
My father quit drinking.
That's not your fault.
There's a park near my house.
I've warned you before about this.
I tend to look at the pictures before reading the text.
At the party, one of his political opponents humiliated him in the presence of many guests.
He ran faster than his brother did.
I wasn't able to remember the title of that song.
He got the job.
Four is an unlucky number in Japanese.
He stayed in New York for three weeks.
It's useless to try.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
She performed her duties.
He ran into the classroom.
I feel bad for that guy.
I'm glad you're OK again.
Everybody knows that Tom likes Mary.
I didn't know you were looking for me.
It serves you right.
I'm afraid I didn't explain it too well.
I have money enough to buy it.
You'd be better off without me.
I think we can help each other.
You need to sleep.
I am harvesting wheat.
I didn't think you were going to make it.
You're going to love this book.
I'm not alone.
He aimed at the bird.
I loved watching you dance.
Tom has blue eyes.
I'd like to borrow this.
Can I see, too?
He added to his savings.
Be prepared.
Don't step on my toes.
Tom, do you still love me?
We must never do this again.
He took out a dollar from his wallet.
What's your home address?
He may still be young, but he really is a reliable person.
This is one of the basic rules.
Just leave me alone.
She sang a Japanese song for us.
I'm training for the triathlon.
I'm not going to name names.
Act like a man.
It was very hot.
They were so different.
You're such a jerk.
I am proud to be a part of this project.
You can't have the job.
Do you think that Tom is happy?
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
Are there many flowers in the garden?
You can say whatever you want to.
Tom looked over the documents carefully.
He's addicted to heroin.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
Hold on. Just let me collect my thoughts.
We were passengers.
Please move to the rear of the bus.
She announced her engagement to him.
I don't know where that came from.
I like your shoes.
I have a surprise for you, sweetheart.
You don't know what it's like to not have enough to eat.
Tom kept reading.

You're very brave.

Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
I bought a new sewing machine.
Never have I seen such a thing.
I've been in trouble before.
Apparently, Tom doesn't like Mary.

Let me see what's in your hand.
I need a crew.
I think you've had enough.
You can't quit now.
I made a fool of myself.
Tom is Mary's stepson.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
Whether you believe it or not, I want to get this thing over with as much as you do.
Just pretend you don't know me.
He can hardly speak.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
What does he see in her?
Is there something I can get for you?
It's the largest in the world.
Can you believe this is already happening?
I've grown tired of watching this uninteresting match.
It would be better if you didn't eat before going to bed.

I think we need to find out where Tom is.
Did anybody see what happened?

He wears thick glasses.
It is important to understand that each country has its own culture.
"You had better not wear the red dress." "Why not?"
I've known her for more than twenty years.
She did it slowly.
I'm disappointed in you.
It was a tedious job.
She misses her family a lot.
I found out something interesting today at work.
I will have it uploaded by Friday.
I wrote that book.
I told him what the problem was.
He ordered the book from the publisher in the United States.
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
What exactly happened?
I wholeheartedly agree.
I think it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to do that by yourself.
I don't feel like doing it.
He is ashamed of his failure.
Tom loved it.
Can I write it that way?
My hobby is collecting stamps.
We shouldn't lose hope.

He's a jesuit.
They have plenty of money.
He's a strange character.
I like your dress.

He has gone too far.
I'll check with you later.
Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it.

Part of the story is true.
Long story short, I was fired.
I feel like I missed something.
She gets up the earliest in my family.
This house has triple–pane windows.
That jacket is way too big for you.
I use this.
There is only one bath towel.
This song reminds me of someone I used to know.

I can't believe I actually said that.
I feed my dog twice a day.
That's what I thought at first.
It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
I can't swim at all.
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders.
Smartphones would have seemed like science fiction ten years ago.
Thank you for granting me permission.
Could you let him out?
I was in charge.
Have you finished breakfast yet?
He always leaves the window open when he sleeps.
Are you sure they can do this?
I want to do some shopping around here.
They aren't telling us the truth.
I'm pleased with their performance.
Have you gone nuts?
Whenever I call, he is out.
He fell and hurt his leg.
Which air conditioner do you think is the most efficient?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
You don't have to take an examination.
Shut the door tight.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
Tom can't help you.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
This medicine will ensure you a good night's sleep.
I think it's you who should apologize to her.
She has been asked to sit on the committee.
I'll try not to make mistakes next time.
What do you want me to say?
Your smile always makes me happy.
I wanted your opinion.
We happened to be on the same train.
I understand what you mean.
It has been wonderful.
Tom married a much younger woman.
I couldn't make myself understood in French.
He has a cold.
I just have to make a call.
I'm glad to see you.
I looked everywhere.
Do you approve of what he is doing?
Is she your only daughter?
I don't want this shirt.
Tom is going to go swimming this afternoon.
My father finally compromised.
Nobody remembers.
I am very glad school is over.
Don't forget to pay the phone bill.
My father's in the garden.
Tom couldn't stop talking to Mary.
Look at the picture.
Hey, what are you two up to?
I can confirm this.
It didn't take you long to get here.
You really are pathetic.
The sea was as smooth as glass.
Let me take my coat off.
The subject has not yet been fully explored.
Really?
I tried everything to keep him alive.
You've got to be bold!
Let's get married.
I hope the weather will be fine tomorrow.
Ask her when she will come back.
A little work won't kill you.
I'd like to get together with you tonight.
I'll be six feet under by then.
I didn't go.
You guys wait here.
How long were you gone?
I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
I think we're too young.
I didn't realize you were Canadian.
Do you smell something?
I really like this skirt. Can I try it on?
Are we disturbing you?
This isn't what Tom needs now.
I thought I was alone here.
I appreciate your confidence.
I'd never seen anything like it.
Where did you get that?
I've never been abroad before.
He was surprised to learn this.
Shouldn't you be at work now?
Tom's a doctor.
There wasn't any special hurry.
I think Tom is still breathing.
I can't imagine what life would be like without you.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Are they friends of yours?
This is all your fault.
People are playing near the beach.
You're incorrigible.
How's your married life?
The flowers will brighten up the table.
Tom spent the remainder of the night thinking about Mary.
What was your question?
Leave it.
That's what you should do.
Tom couldn't help showing off.
I didn't have to go.
He got more than he bargained for.
At last, they were reconciled.
Is this all they do?
The American economy suffered a recession.
Do you have a retirement plan?
I want you to be my partner.
You are beautiful.
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
Bring a lunch.
She is anxious about her safety.
You recognized him, didn't you?
I'd like to keep expenses down.
Isn't that what you're trying to tell me?
We're persevering.
I hope you won't mind.
She advised him not to believe everything the teacher says.
Where did you go?
I need someone who I can talk to.
I'm not a violent person.
Don't go without a hat.
Is it my turn?
He looks like a clever boy.
That's what my mom keeps telling me.
Which one would you take?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You do that and I'll fire you.
What did happen to all that money?
Don't you think it's wonderful?
They're dying.
What is critical thinking?
He is always prepared.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
You need to be careful.
Tom likes Boston better than any other place he's lived.
It's going really well.
I never felt this way before I met you.
That's a shame.
He lay down on the bed.
I had to stay in bed all day.
They huddled together.
We can't satisfy everyone.
I thought you might need help.
It's difficult to teach people what they are unwilling to learn.
I feel bad for them.
I lost my house keys.
I have some very bad news.
I don't have to go to school tomorrow.
She'll give her photo to whoever wants it.
Please stop talking.
I was eventually released.
There is no denying that she is very efficient.
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
We're not all teachers.
The room is covered with dust.
I think someone stole all these things and planted them to make me look guilty.
The bus will be here in five minutes.
I want some of those.
This road will lead you to the center of town.
Tom poured milk on his cereal.
I lost your phone number.
I had fun last night.
He hung a lamp from the ceiling.

What's the most fun you've ever had?

Mary felt like Tom was undressing her with his eyes.
Are you blowing me off?
A hundred people were hurt in a train wreck.
I did it against my will.
I did some checking.
"The good die young" is an old saying which may or may not be true.

I think I've had one too many.
Would you care for some more cake?
Did anybody else see it?
They're arguing.
My friend is bilingual.
Your security guard wouldn't let me in.
What was the first concert you went to?
I need to ask you a favor.
Did you like Boston?
Not knowing what to do, I did nothing.
They're early.
None of the windows were open.
It was shorter than he expected.
There is no going back.
I got the engine going.
Things were never the same after that.
Can you see the picture?
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston.
Here's looking at you, kid.
You should look after the children from time to time.
She decided to be a doctor.
You're not as young as you used to be.
Green is the color of money.
Most castles have a moat surrounding them.

He's highly intelligent.
They say love is blind.
I enjoy talking with you.
I really like him.
Tom is a good cook.
She loves cake.
A promise is not enough.
Thank you for your assistance.
Do you want to do this now?
Be content.
I don't want to get a suntan.
I can't help you with this.
Last night, we went to the theater.
I really like your paintings.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
What is the length of this piece of cloth?
I'm super hungry.
I hate being alone this time of year.
They're students.
Everyone was tense.
Leave me alone now.
I have a big problem.
I rang the doorbell.
He came down to breakfast.
This book is easy enough for them to read.
I don't like the way you look.
Fill out this form, please.
You must not touch the paintings.
That made me very sad.
Your dog is very big.
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
I love to hear a grandfather clock chime.
We found all the boxes empty.
Tom was offended by what Mary said.
She liked that.
We knelt down to pray.
Tie your shoe.
He went down the hill.
This room gets sunshine.
Are you lost?
Tom gives us what we need.
Tell Dad to come.
Your remarks were out of place.
Is that so hard to do?
They're both right.
I strongly advise you to use this.
Don't talk to Tom.
I really think we need to talk.
I don't yet know what I'm going to do.
I'm leaving it to you.
Let's do this properly.
She divorced her husband.
I didn't come here for that reason.

This is messed up.
What more do you need?
She's got such lovely eyes.
I like what you did with your hair.
I feel old.
We caught the thief.
Fantastic!
I tried not to cry in front of him.
You have a pretty good memory.
I've never been abroad.
She advised him to visit that museum.
She divorced him after many years of unhappiness.
You don't have the nerve.
The pain has gone.
He was covered with bruises.
I don't like it when you're so busy.
He will get back soon.
Eat something.
This gun is reportedly very powerful.
I'm the guy who gave Tom that hat.
A true love story never ends.
You're going too fast.
They want to talk to you a moment.
I do a lot of things.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
I slept on the bus.
That matter will take care of itself.
The park was almost empty.
He is equal to the task.
It's sad.
His heart beated slowly.
You're too skinny.
Tom left his briefcase on the subway.
This is not enough.
This is very exciting.
I feel trapped.
It's kind of hard to explain.
Did you go to school today?
I think you did an excellent job.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
How is your family?
It may not be a good idea to eat while you are running.
I'm not a magician.
Please bear in mind what I said.
Everyone's gone home.
How many symphonies did Beethoven write?
We may need it soon.
Tom was given a medal.
I didn't see the fire hydrant.
It's too late for them.
They clung together for warmth.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
I'm not short.
He's playing with my cat.
I don't hear barking.
She wanted him to help her father.
Don't talk like that.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
Where were we?
I am not happy.
Don't bother.
May the new year bring you happiness!
You're charming.
Each of the three boys won a prize.
Shut the door, please.
Hurry up! I don't have all day.
We'll both go.
You're forgetful.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
That's really pathetic.
He doesn't have the capacity to be president.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't like Mary.
You need to hit the gym.
She said she had been happy.
I bought a red tie.
He loves attention.
Tom is wearing a pirate costume.
Whose turn is it?
My father might be at home now.
I know you've got more important things to do.
Look at that house.
He was born and brought up in Tokyo.
I can't help feeling something's not quite right.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
Is everyone all right?
Keep your hands where I can see them.
May I ask you to do me a favor?
Your secret's safe with us.
Did you accomplish your goals?
What are you learning at school?
I have an extremely tight schedule for tomorrow.
They want to know what's going on.
Let's take a group picture.
Lightning hit that tower.
You gotta get more organized.
I got soaking wet.
No one could solve the puzzle.
It was handcrafted.
I don't believe we've been formally introduced.
He was covered with sweat.
Yesterday was Thursday.
The problem is being discussed now.
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me.
You're very sophisticated.
The old chair groaned under her weight.
Tom is a spy.
He's addicted to heroin.
They have few books.
He's a gambler.
I'd like to talk with you in private.
Birds usually wake up early in the morning.
She surprised him with a kiss.
Tom makes me feel safe.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
I go to school every day.
This is a difficult question.
You're very clever.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I like the kind of music that Tom writes.
He has broad shoulders.
We're doomed.
The scenery was beyond description.
The bird flapped its wings.
Tell Tom I'm on my way.
They're against animal abuse.
I didn't want you to make a fuss.
Do you have a crush on my brother?
Did you take a bath?
You're double-parked.
She asked him why he was crying.
I wanted to let you know about that, but Tom told me not to say anything.
I think this will do nicely.
Please come this way.
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
We don't have time to debate.
You want to leave here, don't you?
I told you it was dangerous.
He's in big trouble.
I sincerely apologize.
Everything is all arranged.
I'll be back in an hour.
He's getting cold feet.
Can you swim across the river?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
Give my regards to your family.
Let's hope that Tom can handle that by himself.
He does not understand modern technology.
You were perfect.
Bring me a drink.
I can't do this alone.
Go away before they see you here.
Someday you should give it a try.
Who won?
I disagree completely.
Tom's proposal is worth considering.
This hotel belongs to my brother-in-law.
You were great.
I don't know if I can do this.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
He studied interior decoration.
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
Her house is across the river.
Make a prediction.
Are things OK with you?
I can't do any more.
I thought you had homework.
I appreciate your work.
Why don't you let me take a look?
Just throw your bicycle in the back of the truck and I'll drive you home.
On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers.
The cows are milked at six.
I'm feeling low.
You should have seen it!
Someone is knocking at the door.
He never talked about it.
It is windy today.
My home is close to the station.
She belted out tune after tune at the karaoke bar.
How old is he?
I can't drive myself home.
What kind of work will you do?
I keep thirteen cats.
I'm a farmer.
I can't believe that actually happened.
You must come with me.
I hope you had a good time at the party.
You are blinded by love.
We have a theory.
Let me get that for you.
Tom isn't trained.
I'm motivated.
I love you more than anything.
Is that a trick question?
Tom didn't know where Mary had put her suitcases.
She is envious of my success.
Please be sure to turn off the light before you leave.
Tom realized he was alone.
You need a joystick.
You are no longer welcome here.
Please smile.
These are my CDs.
It's really awesome.
He hit the center of the target with his first shot.
Take care of yourselves!
I have business elsewhere.
I like clocks.
Since you did the cooking, I'll do the dishes.
No matter how hard the training was, she never cried.
I'm not as rich as you are.
He was always faithful to his wife.
He's missed the boat.
I'm very much aware of the danger.
The boy said that the taxi vanished into the fog.
She told me that she loved me.
Any questions?
I understand completely.
He sang off key.
Don't worry about what others say.
Take lots of vitamin C to avoid catching cold.
I was a volunteer for two afternoons.
She never told me.
I question your loyalty.
How much money did you spend on your car?
How big you are!
Why don't you have a party?
You can never be happy if you feel envious of other people.
You seem to be a kind man.
You'll find out soon enough.
Which is it going to be?
Are they all strong?
I'm glad you didn't do it.
I can't do two things at once.
Why don't you love me?
I was completely shocked.
I thought you didn't like romance movies.
Tom is in there alone.
He didn't say a word to me all day.
You can go to the station by bus.
He'll be back in a few minutes.
I liked them before they were popular.
You will have to work a lot.
I was deeply impressed by the scenery.
I'm way stronger than I used to be.
Tom has been absent since last Monday.
I felt myself being lifted up.
We don't have much more time.
How do you feel about the war?
Who cares?
It takes one to know one.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
It isn't over yet.
Don't believe anything they say.
What were you doing then?
I'm not sure when he'll come.
You don't want much, do you?
I was never good at grammar.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
I don't have to clean my room.
She is afraid of falling ill again.
We've used almost all the money.
I feel the need to do something different today.
Shape up or ship out!
Where does that bus go?
You should have come earlier.
They did not have good equipment.
Tom will be here tonight.
He negotiated a free trade agreement with Canada.
How about we go for a drink?
I rode my bicycle to the store.
What ship were you on?
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
Are you going by bus or car?
It is kind of you to help me.
He did it willingly.
I'm not the one who should go.
Did you hear what I said?
Stop talking loudly.
I've already done the hard part.
I'll bring lunch.
You are not Japanese.
No one will stop us.
Last year, I decided to come to Japan.
I didn't realize you were awake.
She was fully clothed.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
Let's keep in touch with each other.
He said that he would call you later.
I can go next week.
It is true that she is pretty, but she is selfish.
Why am I so tired?
That's the law.
Can I take a break?
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
You know what I'm talking about.
Everyone smiled but Tom.
I would very much like to go.
That's your responsibility.
She presented him with the trophy.
Tom looked for his glasses.
My cousin isn't the kind of person who'd ever break a promise.
I love barbecue.
Where did you learn this?
Stop whining like a baby.
We went to the beach to swim.
We must finish everything before Tuesday morning.
This is an apple, too.
I liked having you here tonight.
He commited suicide.
In any case, it's always my fault.
That's ridiculous!
Time flies.
I went straight to bed.
I'm responsible for Tom's safety.
He unbuttoned his shirt.
I don't ever want to hurt you.
She advised him to read more books.
Looking at your Facebook friends' photos is a waste of time.
I'm going to be all right.
The light faded out.
He behaved like a child.
I had a stroke last year.
We must retreat.
Tell them what happened.
It's thanks to his father that he owns this hotel.
Do I annoy you?
I finally understand what you're saying.
I want to work with you.
Please close the door behind you.
That's one of them.
I ate a salad for lunch.
The moon has no atmosphere.
We became best friends.
What's the matter with you?
We'll be late for dinner.
You're too tense.
I caught five fish yesterday.
This is not what we want.
Is there somebody you want to see?
Nobody was hungry except me.
Is this your bike?
We can't change history, but we can learn from it.
Why don't I have a girlfriend?
It was no problem.
I could see Tokyo Tower far away.
Who did you talk to?
It's embarrassing.
Perhaps I shouldn't have done that.
He kept his promise.
I didn't realize you were serious.
I didn't know you had a cat.
Let's play soccer.
Shall we talk about it over a cup of coffee?
All the stones have been moved.
I'm happy you're here.
I don't care a bit about the future.
We found that we had lost our way.
We heard the boy playing the violin.
Are you mentally ill?
Might I ask your name?
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Have you put on weight?
Everyone wants what they can't have.
It was cheaper than I thought.
We were studying all afternoon.
You're not fired.
Glad to see you again.
Tom lost his job.
It's just a dream.
Do I curse too much?
Sit here.
You must make allowance for his lack of experience.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
I don't understand what you are talking about.
Shall we walk or drive?
He felt himself growing old.
Scientists haven't found a cure for cancer yet.
It's a dead giveaway.
I drove the car into the garage.
At present, the cause of the disease is unknown.
I guess this desk will serve the purpose until we can get a new one.
I like being with you.
Let's not waste this chance.
How was the roast beef?
He played a minor part in the play.
It's impossible to change it now.
I really hope you can come.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
What exactly are they doing in there?
This data is incorrect.
I called you.
He fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
He goes to school on foot.
I don't know if we're going to be able to make it to Boston for Christmas.
Hopefully, Tom will get into Harvard.
The angry mob overturned cars and smashed storefront windows.
I've broken my glasses.
I have hives.
I'm not done with you.
This isn't the time for stupid jokes.
I finally have everything I need.
I don't have time to be sick.
It's against my principles.
Are you still playing golf?
Can you prove it?
They set up a new company in London.
This boat is no longer seaworthy.
When will you ever learn?
Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
You can't understand this sentence, can you?
I'm from Zambia.
He did it just for fun.
She may not wait any longer.
She talked on and on about her family problems.
Do you want to go fishing tomorrow?
It was a wonderful feeling.
You don't seem so busy.
He is reading.
I'll call back a bit later.
Thank you for picking me up.
The students bowed to their teacher.
He is afraid of making mistakes.
He doesn't seem to care.
I have to do this alone.
I want to think about it.
Even though I had eaten a lot for breakfast, I was already hungry.
I went to the bank to take out money.
I'm between jobs.
I find myself in a rather delicate situation.
They are eating their apples.
Come along with me.
You know what I'm talking about.
We have to follow the regulations.
That's impossible.
You can't force me to do anything I don't want to do.
Gradually the interest rate will increase.
You shouldn't depend on others too much.
You must get up a little earlier.
He loves you very much.
I heard a noise behind me.
What a loss!
This guy is great.
She burst into the room.
If it had not been for your advice, I would have failed.
If he had been free, he would have gone fishing.
I'm pretty busy.
Tom calls Mary every night.
Summer is over.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to go camping?
He took off his clothes.
Have you been here since?
I would take it as a sign.
Is that yours?
She did her best never to think of him.
Just answer my question.
Although we don't have much money, I want to buy this painting.
I think we both know why I'm here.
We thought you could do it.
You were perfect.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
We have enough water.
It isn't new.
Feel this. It's really soft.
He's always on time for his appointments.
It's weird.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
Have you ever played golf?
I'm unbiased.
I walk my dog in the park every morning.
Tom asked me to cut his hair.
If it were not for the sun, there would be no life on the earth.
Are you scared of me?
I opened the box, but it was empty.
He bought a new pair of gloves.
I like all of the songs that Tom sings.
She's pleased with her new dress.
This is too hard.
I was born the year the war ended.
What do you think of when you look at this photo?
Isn't that what you're here to tell us?
Don't just stand there.
You should set a good example for your children.
I came across your brother on the street.
The old man died from hunger.
I just want to be normal.
How much do you know about artificial intelligence?
Are you a law student?
That's my cat.
I have to get out of here.
I hope to one day speak German as well as you speak English.
Do you know the man that's staring at you?
You need to be more careful from now on.
We better tell the others.
Go play in traffic.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
You weren't married for long, were you?
I opened a bottle of red wine.
Who did you learn it from?
How's your day going?
A part of this land is mine.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you.
I want to ask you a question.
Feeling the house shake, I ran outside.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
You're not very funny.
You've got to wait.
Don't sell yourself short.
I have very sensitive skin.
Tom found out the truth.
What if something went wrong?
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
Be respectful.
He has something to do with the matter.
A shiver ran down my spine.
I don't know what the truth is.
What's your favorite dessert?
Don't expose it to the rain.
I want you to go upstairs.
You made me proud.
The prisoners were set free.
I made friends with them at the school festival.
We lost the game.
Did you say something?
That suits me.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
Tom can't swim.
I think about you often.
This is messed up.
She is familiar with the subject.
This is a pretty amazing place.
Tom is very good at playing the violin.
You look Japanese.
They handled it well.
You're very funny.
They concluded he was lying.
Don't be so impatient.
We had a blast.
The cat is not dead.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
I'll have to make amends to them for my mistake.
They arranged a meeting.
Do you like his songs?
I doubt if he will come on time.
Luckily, he won the championship.
The senator denied repeated requests for an interview.
I'm looking forward to it.
I'll kill it.
You don't look Japanese.
He lives alone in an apartment.
Tom didn't have to do this.
Hold the vase with both hands.
They're in the hot tub.
This is excellent wine.
Change your mind, if you want to.
He was dressed in blue.
I'm not your baby.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
I don't know if they still live there.
I'm feeling fine now.
I've always liked your hair that way.
You are naughty.
These books and clothes are all yours.
As I was reading, I became more interested.
Give me your address.
Do you think I'm too tall?
Tom asked Mary for assistance.
What are you supposed to do?
She was livid.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.
They gave it to me.
"May I call you tonight?" "Sure."
I think it's Tom's motorcycle.
They abandoned the plan.
Even Japanese can make mistakes when they speak Japanese.
I really can't leave right now.
To put it briefly, I do not agree.
That guy is off his rocker!
You should pay attention to his story.
You're quite attractive.
Don't be mean.
Please hold this ladder steady.
He is ashamed of his father being poor.
I'll go get the broom.
I don't want Tom's death on my conscience.
When the man saw a policeman, he fled.
Have you finished?
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow.
She's not here to defend herself against these accusations.
Unless you stop fighting, I'll call the police.
You are a good person.
She laid her baby on the bed.
If you have a good garden, it will enhance the value of your house.
That might actually work.
I'm exhausted.
I like reading books.
Turn your papers in.
He helped me fix my watch.
I haven't seen you for ages.
Could you cancel my reservation?
She gave an oral report to her boss.
Is there hot water?
I was very hungry.
You're very wise.
I'm uninsured.
He hid his emotions and pretended to be enthusiastic.
Your house needs painting.
My father finally compromised.
It's bound to rain.
You were late, weren't you?
Are you really not going?
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
That seems right.
His long speech bored us all.
No one saw anything.
Since he doesn't feel well today, he can't come to the office.
You were almost in time.
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy.
Who's your favorite poet?
I had to do everything on my own.
Marriage is the last thing on my mind.
There were enough.
Tom is a common name.
Eat your veggies.
It's raining cats and dogs.
Please tell me what's going on here.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
Are they satisfied?
I can't deal with that problem right now.
Would you say that again?
What're you doing?
She never thinks about him.
Is eating healthy more costly?
What was that noise?
Don't worry. We have plenty of water and food.
Tom should be here any minute.
You will have a new sister.
I received my birthday present.
Who vanished?
Don't forget that.
Now, what else can I do for you?
I'm going to put a curse on you.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
Tom should do as Mary suggests.
You don't look that good.
Maybe I should go with you.
You've risked enough.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Who's there?
Tom didn't want to talk to anyone.
When all you have is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail.
My roommate complained about the noise.
Who sent you?
We've just finished breakfast.
Give me a second.
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
Time waits for no one.
What is the exchange rate?
You have a lot of nerve.
Why aren't you all laughing?
Fear washed across the stock market.
I'm one of you.
We can see the island in the distance.
You look very pale.
I've always dreamed of owning my own business.
I realized what was happening.
Did something happen?
The theory is too abstract for me.
The hunter put ammunition in the gun.
Don't use your real name.
Go away. I'm busy.
I could swim faster when I was young.
You don't need to go there.
You're foolish.
I live here now.
Let me help you.
I finally won.
What subject do you like best?
This is my new tricycle.
How many books do you read per month?
He is leaving for Peru tomorrow, isn't he?
I want proof.
Do you have any allergies?
Let me give you a lift as far as the station.
Tom's left.
They clung together for warmth.
You can't just not do your job.
This tea is really sweet.
What are your qualification?
If you try, you'll succeed.
Thank you for the time you spent with me during my visit to Atlanta.
A child needs love.
I'm sorry I was rude to you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Don't put words in my mouth.
Everybody's a winner.
I got what you asked for.
Could I get some tea?
The value of a good education cannot be measured in terms of money.
Is Tom still in the hospital?
I cannot do without this book.
I think we'd better ask Tom what he thinks.
My uncle isn't young, but he's healthy.
That's not surprising.
He has a car that I gave him.
She put on her sweater.
Did I touch a nerve?
I heard Tom is filing for divorce.
They were all teachers.
Which do you prefer, apples or bananas?
All the other kids do it.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
Tom has done the best he can do.
I was quite shocked by this.
This is my room.
He's a singer that's loved by everyone.
I was offered the choice of tea or coffee.
Quit hassling me.
I love traveling.
I'm not advocating that.
I need to press the button.
Got it?
Tom seldom makes mistakes when writing in French.
He secretly showed me her picture.
It's about time for dinner.
There's so much I want to say to you.
You're too young to remember the nineties.
She was very proud of her father.
Could you give me a ride?
They'll go shopping.
The body converts extra calories into fat.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
Tom told Mary that she was the fattest woman he'd ever seen.
I don't know what I know.
I just want you to know that I regret it.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
I couldn't understand his joke.
This is very easy.
Long story short, I was fired.
I'll sign it.
I pawned my guitar to pay the rent.
He isn't at home, is he?
A combination of several mistakes led to the accident.
You're too trusting.
I cut down a cherry tree.
I've found a job.
As a rule, I go to school before eight o'clock.
Let me paint you a picture.
He will play tennis tomorrow.
I didn't recognize what it was.
This is a happy occasion.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
Let's get off the bus.
Include me in your plans.
Please keep it a secret.
They found it.
How tall you are!
Whenever I try to get near her, she pushes me away.
We left the movie early.
He is an ideal husband for me.
They are very compatible.
I was fired.
He's doing it right.
There are no mistakes in your essay.
I brought one just in case.
I thought that I told you to stay behind.
I believe that he is a reliable man.
The young guy wants to drink.
My father drives very well.
You must concentrate your attention on what you are doing.
Close the door, please.
She was approaching thirty when I first met her.
I don't want you two talking about me.
Tom didn't tell me this.
There were no knives.
How many people are on board the ship?
Get on your knees.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Is it right for a doctor to decide when someone should die?
The banks aren't open on Saturdays.
All good things come from above.
You lost an earring.
Can you still remember the time we first met?
Did you get all that?
Tom was found dead in his room.
Could you please clear the table?
I baked it this morning.
I had not seen a lion before I was ten years old.
Read as many books as possible.
I was shocked to see this.
This will be a very dangerous mission.
The atomic number for hydrogen is 1.
Make yourself at home.
How was your summer vacation?
My sister got engaged.
Sometimes it's not so simple.
Do you ever sleep?
How would you reword this sentence to make it sound more natural?
He was reading a book at that time.
Many TV programs have a bad influence on children.
The passengers all went aboard the ship.
See you at lunch.
Nobody is too old to learn.
Can I get something to eat?
You don't seem very satisfied.
You need to help me do this.
If the spaghetti sticks when you throw it against the wall, it's done.
I got my hair cut.
I have no friends to help me.
What's in the file?
Please wait here.
You're sneaky.
Why not wait until tomorrow?
You're too skinny.
It is almost three.
There is little prospect of my success.
It looks like a UFO.
He is said to have taken part in the battle.
Who wants it?
He apologized to the employee.
I'm so happy for you, Tom.
What's your speciality?
The storm has died down.
She cried when she heard the story.
Don't you think it's time you left?
Whatever happened to acid rain? You don't hear about it in the news anymore.
I want to share it with you.
How about running?
I'll leave that to you.
Are you nervous?
I don't want to go bowling.
There's something else in the drawer.
Do you speak Japanese?
He's as strong as a horse.
He saved us all.
The car bumped the tree.
Like it or not, you must do it.
I'll trust you.
Are you staying for dinner?
What kind of food do you usually cook?
He started to speak English.
I don't like being cheated.
It's getting light. Morning is coming.
I have to make some calls.
I don't eat out as often as I'd like.
She endured to the bitter end.
He failed to become a cabinet member at that time.
You should lower your standards.
You may call on me whenever you like.
It was pitch black outside.
Sometimes things that happen do not make sense.
He slowly let the clutch out and drove off.
Wish me luck.
I'm not asking for money.
I'm not armed.
Please don't cut me off like that.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
The urban-renewal project is now well under way.
You seem happy.
Someone please help me.
You're a liar.
I'm not busy anymore.
I want to get back to Boston.
Your demands are unreasonable.
What can you make out?
This broken vase can't be repaired.
The shop is closed on Sunday.
Tom is kind of worked up about it.
You don't seem very pleased.
Where did you get this list?
We're going to freeze to death.
You're doing the right thing.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
I had a great time.
I was right behind Tom.
What is your decision?
That is of no use to me.
Women today drink as much as men.
I think I have a gum infection.
My cat is white.
I am going to the swimming pool.
Tom goes to bed at the same time every night.
We talked about music.
We can handle that.
We can't keep them in the dark forever.
It's important to have an off-site backup of all the data on your computer.
I like girls.
You're the only one who understands me.
This really is something.
How did you come by such a job?
A good poker player can tell when someone's bluffing.
We'll change trains at the next station.
Do you know whose car this is?
Tom was probably drunk when he did that.
What is your favorite holiday?
I want to be alone for a while.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
You're the leader.
Would you be willing to help?
More and more married couples share household chores.
He said he did not know the man, which was a lie.
I don't know that much about you.
Tom walked towards the stairs.
I was told that I should see a doctor.
I thought you'd ask that.
We're volunteering.
He told me to leave the window open.
It was kind of fun.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you and your boyfriend had broken up?
I'm at the beach.
I dream a lot.
I passed the examination with difficulty.
Why did you paint this wall black?
I heard you did well.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
I'm the type who likes to think things over very carefully.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
I didn't need your help.
I don't think I can help you.
Tom is claustrophobic.
I want each of you to tell me exactly what you did last weekend.
No students could answer the question.
Iron is hard.
Don't tell anyone we've done this.
Being aware of what and how much we eat is essential to good health.
I broke a glass.
I thought you did fairly well.
I get nervous when I speak in front of large crowds.
Please let me take your picture.
She introduced me to her father.
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I thought they'd heard us.
Give the money to my son.
He has no friends to talk with.
We're married now.
I had no alternative.
Is it about ten million yen?
I have finished.
Thank you for your advice.
I'm glad.
Will that be for here or to go?
Don't use computer translation.
He cut him short by saying no.
I'm excited.
At last, I caught up with my friends.
Tom is taking care of me.
You were my friend.
I thought it might be you.
You were my friend.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
Is this water drinkable?
They didn't see it.
You didn't get very far.
A poor school record will count against you when you look for a job.
Tom has trouble fitting in.
It's really windy today.
Some students were sitting on the bench and having lunch.
My baby brother sleeps ten hours a day.
He is capable of treachery.
Are you speaking metaphorically?
I want to buy them all.
Did you see anyone leave?
Give me a coffee, please.
Where were you born?
I slept a little during lunch break because I was so tired.
That's open to debate.
That can happen sometimes.
You won't believe this.
Which is your pen?
You think you're pretty funny, don't you?
Due to the worsening weather, the departure was delayed.
We should probably ask Tom first.
Why do you want to commit suicide?
It's not that noticeable.
Don't ever think otherwise.
Are you coming or not?
All humans on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.
Why don't you drop her a line?
Is this fish still alive?
We can't work without electricity.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
Let me tell you how I really feel.
They love their kids.
It was a bold decision.
That baby is fat and healthy.
You're very good.
A flu shot contains antibodies that fight the H1N1 virus.
They were playing tennis.
What were you two doing?
You need to redecorate your room.
Please wait around for a while.
I work alone.
This television set is heavy.
Tom will do a great job.
How was your summer?
Many famous artists live in New York.
I'm at home.
She probably knows.
Is it a secret or something?
My hobby is taking pictures of wild flowers.
The cat scratched my hand.
It's not polite to point at others.
He faked his death and assumed a new identity.
You were fantastic.
Let's get started.
He is well paid.
I'm sorry. I got the wrong number.
I would act differently in your place.
Those are your options.
Don't get too excited.
When I got to school, the race had already finished.
Are you real sure about that?
He'll be here real soon.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
Please give me some latitude this time.
I love spending time with you.
Can I stay?
The apple fell from the tree.
I speak from experience.
We had to stop.
This book is a fascinating read.
It's not really necessary.
There was a Brazilian girl in my class last year.
I'm not a bit tired.
Because of the dense fog, nothing could be seen.
How long did you stay at the party?
He asked about you.
Math and English were my favorite subjects.
I wasn't scared at all.
Tell the maid to make the beds.
He continued doing it.
It's six degrees below zero.
It can be dangerous.
You must be very busy these days.
Physics is my weak subject.
I saw a town in the distance.
I know Tom has gone to Boston.
A considerable amount of money was appropriated for the national defense.
They were taken prisoner.
My car is a Toyota.
He is holding his books under his arm.
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
I know you've been busy.
I was on a trip to India.
I can't reach the top shelf.
He makes no half-hearted attempts.
We're doing well.
They knew exactly what they were doing.
The room was packed.
I thought I was going crazy.
Circumstances did not permit me to help you.
There is an urgent need for volunteers.
He promised not to say it.
The experiment seemed to be going well.
Clearly you're not interested.
That's the right attitude.
I wonder if this water is drinkable.
Your team is better than ours.
Do you know what I mean?
Why did you join the Army?
You're absolutely right.
She intended to go shopping.
Tom didn't have time to watch the TV program he wanted to watch.
I'm afraid I'm not available.
I caught the man stealing the money.
What a strange man!
How can I tell if I'm really in love?

The warranty doesn't cover normal wear and tear.
You owe Tom an apology.
I just had to check on something.
I want to find a way for us to be happy.
Do you want to go get a drink?
Don't let such a good opportunity go by.
We've endured three wars.
He shared in my happiness.
Is Tom your name?
What else is on today's agenda?
I've never lost to Tom.
Stop!
Charge this to my account.
We were actually pretty lucky.
I just have so much on my mind.
We have a bit of time now.
You're not wanted here.
I have no one to blame but myself.
You should've seen what Tom did.
Are you aware of how much she loves you?
I want to go on a trip with you.

Get out of here now!
I want to go over it again.
This is the best party I've been to all year.
Does that trouble you?
I like swimming.
Does that satisfy you?
I refuse to allow this.
It's inadequate.
She felt very bad that day.
You'll have a hard time.
I can't figure out why he said so.
Do you have a big family?
Are you sure you can do this?
It seems that he is unable to swim.
Tom is watching golf.
He seems to have told a lie.

Where's the pharmacy?
She can't ski.
I'd like to see your ticket, please.
Use them all.
I've never told anyone that before.
Tomorrow's my day off.
We didn't do a thing.
I need another one.
She has green eyes.
I can't believe you fell for that.
How long did you stay at the party?
Is it time you need?
I want to share this with you.
You can't believe that.
I cried on his shoulder.
She is a runner.
She kept crying all the time.
It's very easy to sound natural in your own native language, and very easy to sound unnatural in your non-native language.
We went to the station to see her off.
You are always as busy as a bee.
Tom came here to help me.
Did they live here?
I wasn't thinking clearly.
He seldom, if ever, comes.
It won't hurt you to skip one meal.
You've been warned.
We want to talk to Tom.
I don't have a key.
You seem pretty calm about it.
I've got a rope in my trunk.
I guess we should leave now.
Tell me again where you live.
We all laughed.
You don't seem so busy.
Do I have to do it over again?
You are in a safe place.

I felt a sudden pain in my side.
You're incredibly talented.
I suppose that's OK.
I found this watch at the station.
If everything goes according to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night.
That might happen on Monday.
Can you narrow that down a little?
Were you shot?
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
Tom doesn't want to go to such a dangerous place.
In a democracy, it is important that the press be independent.
You should face up to the reality.

Why am I doing this?
He drank a little.
The boy had a mischievous smirk on his face.
Try some.
She listens to him.
I did everything I could to help Tom find a job.
I put my clothes in the dryer.
Are you still sleepy?
We came by to wish you luck.

He went to see her in the hospital every other day.
He's not a team player.
Can you make it so she can get on that TV program?
Could you please be quiet?

You're unambitious.
The sooner we start, the sooner we'll finish.
I just don't want to do it again.
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
Tom drinks beer every day.
You have restored my faith in humanity.

Are you looking for somebody?
I always felt like she was hiding something.
I enjoy looking at my old diary.
I'll buy a new one.
Thanks so much.
She didn't visit anybody.
We just have to get out of here.
This wall feels cold.
Tom had no sooner arrived than he was asked to leave.

I expect you know all about it.
I can't wait for tomorrow to come.
It frosted last night.
I broke up with him.
They let me go.
I really need to go home and catch some zees.
She spoke wisely.
Your boyfriend is cheating on you.
We're really married.
That boy is his brother.
I never imagined we'd end up like this.
Only one man survived.
Maybe this was a mistake.
You need not have come so early.
Everyone is here.

I don't really recall.
Green suits you.
I can't wait to eat it.

Make a choice.
You understand, right?
They were naive.
I met a man from Boston this afternoon.
I'm from Tokyo, Japan.

We'll find it.
A cat ran across the street.

You're the teacher.
Were you looking at her legs?
This is so good.
Let me handle it.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
You are always complaining.
She doesn't yet know the truth.

I still need some help here.
He turned out to be her father.
I like green peppers very much.
I wish there were a French translation of this book.
We all strive for success.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever held in my arms.
I'm eating now.
We learned about the importance of eating a healthy lunch.
I think I can reach the branch if you'll give me a boost.
That was years ago.

We talked to each other for a while.
I suggested that the meeting be put off.
I haven't downloaded the files yet.

You seem busy.
He may not be able to come.
I'm forgetful.
She expected him to solve the problem.
Don't let it get to you.
I made the woman angry.
Nobody cares what you think.
They don't know me there.
I can't see well.
That's not what I was doing.
How did you get into my house?
It's my fault, not yours.
I love to see you laugh.
Why do I believe you?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
This is inappropriate.
I'd like Tom to be happy.
You don't have to come.
He will be waiting for her.
Unfortunately he refused to come.
The baby was shaking the rattle.
Is that a threat?
When did you arrive in Boston?
Tom doesn't even know me.
I've never actually seen a real cow.
I didn't know tofu was this tasty.
From time to time, I want to relax and forget everything.
I've been thinking about you, too.
Next year my birthday will fall on Sunday.
Just stick around a few days and you'll come to love this place.
Anyone who criticizes him is asking for trouble.

Would you like to switch seats?
What do you call this bird?
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
He thanked me for coming.
You're awesome.
A stranger is a friend you just haven't met yet.
You'll have to ask someone else.
Show it to him.
I don't mind lending you the money provided you pay it back within a month.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
He has no remorse.
I don't want to waste your time.
I was ashamed.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Did you find that helpful?
They won.
I'm strong enough.
Here's my chance.
She gave a poor explanation for being late.
You're very observant.
I know a lot about it.
That's not what I'm here for.
It was on the morning of February the ninth that I arrived in London.

We all work too hard.
We're like family.
The appendix is about 10 cm long.
Let's take a tea break.
You should get that sofa reupholstered.
The fence will be painted by Tom tomorrow.
Wake up.
Children threw stones at him.
I took sides with them in the argument.
I am very happy to hear about your engagement.
I found your cap.
She quit her job for some reason.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
We know you're not stupid.
Can you tell what's wrong with it?
Their names were crossed off the list.
Tom never came back.
The earth's moon is a natural satellite.
You're too trusting.
Don't call the cops, man.
Where do you work now?
What happened exactly?
I'm a TV addict.
Does he need to run so fast?
You're very brave.
He described the incident in detail.
We could see the ship in the distance.
I thought I was on time.
How big you are!
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
Doing something only half-heartedly is the worst thing you can do.
What are we having for supper?
He has a daughter who is pretty.
Last winter, I went to Canada to ski.
On second thought, I think I will have a slice of that pie.
You have a lot of nerve.
He seems quite happy.
Where did you park the car?
I want a status report.
I feel strange.
She didn't press him for an explanation.
He is used to walking long distances.
We happened to be in Hokkaido then.
We're going back.
Bangkok is Thailand's capital city.
I know you recently retired.
The natives saw an airplane then for the first time.

Would you chill out?
Look, I'm being serious.
We're very excited.
Would you like to go with me?
May I take your coat?
I'm doing all I can.
Isn't he a bit young?
It's high time you left for school, isn't it?
It snowed a lot last year.
I'm ready to go.
I've never lied to you.
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
It's all about technique.
We will soon take off.
The piano has a good tone.
Have you told your parents?
Don't rely too much on others.

I don't know what else we should do.
You have good taste in music.
I got up early in order to attend the meeting.
You lied to me.
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
What did you find?
I should've expected this to happen.
She obeys him.
I remember mailing your letter yesterday.
I don't have my purse.
Let's stop here.
I hate you.
I still do that.
How much should I feed my dog?
I almost feel sorry for you.
He got hooked on drugs at a young age.
It's no problem.
I'm faithful to my wife.
I don't know what to call you.
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
It's time for our children to go to bed.
No more can be said.
I don't want you to change.
I think Tom wanted my help.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Does this book belong to you?
He isn't actually the manager.
Which is your target?
She went to the hairdresser's to have her hair done.
What exactly am I paying for?
She has lived alone for ages.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
He fed the horse.
I'd like to get some sleep.
This is for your protection.
Nobody is here.
You'll get into trouble.
I have a solution.
It was our secret.
That's probably not true.
You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?
I've had the time of my life.
That's exactly what I want.

I've been having some bad luck.
Are you tired?
This is your hat, isn't it?
It's not a secret.
I was born the year the war ended.
Do you think that any really smart person is inherently interested in languages?
Can they give you something for that?
She told him where to put the suitcase.
You can use this pen for the time being.
He thought of a good solution.
Someone screamed.
Are you going to work until 10:00?
I can't believe that's what's really bothering Tom.
I heard Tom scream.
It has been raining since last Thursday.
I've been meaning to get in touch.
I asked him his name.
The clouds hid the sun.
It's a pity they're getting divorced.
Why do you interrupt me all the time?
That's how I feel now.
I'd like a hotel reservation.
You always said you wanted to become a scientist. Why didn't you?
We're all going home.
He did not get up early in the morning.
I like hanging out here.
Tom is a much better liar than you.
I've got no place to go, so I'm going to stay here.
Tom kept silent all day.
I expected you to be here for lunch.
You're crafty.
This website seems quite good.
I want you to go home.
I answered for him.
She is going on 35.
Tom's dog is very big.
What's new with you? How is your new job working out?
I guess I was lucky.
We were all tired.
Is this a coincidence?
Where is the elevator?
Could you translate this sentence?
That dog is exactly twice the size of this one.
If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave.
Come to my office.
I want to take you to dinner.
The girl said that she had never heard of such a person.
I've given up smoking.
I know what you were hoping for.
There's no choice.
She bought him a ticket.
I don't think any of us should go.
We must inform them.
I'm crazy.
I want to see them.
You always were good at math.
Actually it might be a good idea to start right now.
Where are the dishes?
He rolled his eyes.
I was at a loss for words.
Don't make me blush.
You don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it.
We didn't think of that.
What have we got?
This tea is very good.
I love him, but he loves someone else.
Please think it over.
I don't know what that word means.
What would happen if I pushed this button?
I fell in love with her at first sight.
How about 12:45?
It's a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
Is there any other way I can pay you?
She bought him a dog. However, he was allergic to dogs, so they had to give it away.
I have to go.
We’ve been waiting for hours.
I handled it.
They live in a commune.
The best thing would be for you to do the work yourself.
I never wanted to compete with you.
People should love one another.
I can't go with you tonight.
Could you please tell me what your cell phone number is?
Our bus collided with a truck.
I can't go in there.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
There are grammar mistakes in this composition.
Have you already settled the bill?
You've been busy, haven't you?
He was invited.
Look at the size of that thing!
I'm happy with what I've got.
You must not smoke while working.
I want to get there by subway.
Did you sew this by hand?
I can't agree with you on this matter.
I'll swim.
Let's stay focused.
I'll warn Tom.
I wonder if anybody can help us.
My book is here.
Yesterday a truck hit this wall.
How did you kill the guards?
I am accustomed to working hard.
Good students always keep their desk clean.
How much did you have to pay for the tickets?
Further testing is required.
After eight months, he eventually started dating girls again.
Nobody talks to Tom anymore.
I thought you'd like it.
We need some more information.
She was hit by a car.
I always pay the rent on time.
This is a time of rejoicing.
They made me go there.
Tom said he didn't even want to think about that.
What did you eat?
I'm not like other people.
That's all wrong.

I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
I don't understand what that means.
I want to let go of your hands now.
Did he pass the exam?
That's better than nothing.
That accident is a very good example of what happens when you're not careful.
Where are your people?
The effect was quite different from what was intended.
Unlock the door.
Ask around.
She was only frightened, not injured.
I know what you're probably thinking.
I never learned to write.
I'd like to talk to one of your guests.
It's only a temporary solution.
I wasn't fat when I was a kid.
Money influences everything.
I would like to live in France.
They seem to be enjoying themselves.
Tom is tidying his room.
He was heartbroken.
She told me his name after he had left.
Everything has been arranged.
What're you thinking?
He is terrible at speaking English.
I remember playing the original Pac-Man game when I was a kid.
It is irresponsible of you to break your promise.
I saved your life.
The next day was Christmas Day.
Do you have some buttermilk?
Tomorrow is Christmas.
I'm going to be late.
They clung together for warmth.
Hey, how do you get this thing open?
The sky was full of stars.
Those who use forks or chopsticks often think people who don't are uncivilized.
What are you so angry about?
How can you be so callous?
I prefer cats to dogs.
The black one is mine.
Who painted this picture?
You don't seem to want to come with us.
I don't have anything to declare.
I would like to have a cup of coffee.
You gotta get more organized.
He hurt his knee when he fell.
I like math.
One problem translators face is that sometimes the source document is poorly written.
I need to find Tom now.
Do you think that eating breakfast every day is important?
I feel a little responsible.
It's time to go to school.
It's every man for himself.
He has a headache.
I have very good eyesight.
We have to make sure we have enough volunteers.
Why are you so hard-headed?
I love Boston.
You must return the book to him.
It is cheap, but on the other hand it is not good.
I don't know you anymore.
I need to make an appointment.
You're not dressed.
I'll lend you any book that I have, as long as you keep it clean.
Tom held his breath.
You've worked hard for months and have certainly earned a holiday.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
I know where you keep your gun.
You have only to watch what I do.
She forced him to eat his vegetables.
We need three more of these.
You can't live without water.
The pain was almost unbearable.
You don't really want that, do you?
Your parents didn't come, did they?
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
How will he pay his debts?
Is anything missing?
I just can't take it.
I'm psychic.
Forget it!
Let's go camping.
It's not your fault.
Read this book at your leisure.
I don't know you.
In addition to English, he speaks German.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
He should have kept his mouth shut.
I just got up. Give me a few minutes to get ready.
What did you do then?
How long have you been ill?
It is still fresh in my memory.
I'm losing.
She had her dress made.
Let him go.
He died the next day.
How are you doing these days?
They are on good terms with each other.
I've never trusted strangers.
I thought doing this would be easy, but we've been working all day and we're still not finished.
I got fined.
She braked hard when she saw a child run out into the road.
I took Highway 58.
Did you go to Nikko yesterday?
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Were you even tempted?
I rechecked the data.
Can I go swimming, Mother?
I feel like taking a walk.
Everybody in the building felt the earthquake.
Do you enjoy losing?
Do you believe in UFOs?
This word has two meanings.
Clean out the shed and throw away things you don't need.
Are you free for dinner tonight?
He behaved like a child.
I know what we can do.
Is there a zoo in Boston?
In case of a fire, use the stairs.
It was cold, so we lit a fire.
Are you blackmailing me?
They worked like bees.
It's food.
Thanks a bunch.
I can't breath through my nose.
He was standing.
It was nice of you to come all this way to see me.
I have small hands.
Tom seems to be in love.
Will you please check these figures?
It is really nice of you.
I can't come tonight.
I'll do what you ask.
I don't want to meet your parents.
I remember seeing you last year.
I saw everything.
I remember telling her that news.
I thought I told you to stay in the car.
That's none of your concern.
Bring that here.
He had an accident and fractured his leg.
You didn't let me finish.
I study French at school.
Cats have pointed ears.
Well, how did it happen anyway?
This is a bus stop.
I can't do that.
He is already here.
I can show you a better time.
Give me something to eat.
If you were in my place, what would you do?
I don't get very many opportunities to talk with native speakers.
I work at a zoo.
How did you get so good at French?
I've told you over and over again not to do that.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
He lost himself quickly in the crowd.
I don't like your name.
I love reading books.
I relayed the message to Tom.
I'm really feeling kind of strange.
Are all of them your friends?
Flowers die if they don't have water.
Tom doesn't take very good care of his children.
I drive a hybrid.
Is there another solution?
He could not find what I had hidden.
I can't go to work in these clothes.
We went on a picnic together.
I'm not a disbeliever.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I don't recall saying that.
Boys are not welcome.
Not everyone agrees.
It doesn't matter what I believe.
I almost forgot all about that.
What was wrong with them?
I need something to write with.
Tom didn't know who Mary wanted to give the bottle of wine to.
Tom and Mary rearranged the furniture in their living room.
Who do you live with?
I got a temporary job at the firm.
Everybody makes mistakes.
You had better not use those four-letter words.
Where is the toothpaste?
It's not known who first invented the wheel.
He had to part with his house.
Where is the station?
How did we reach this point?
Stop complaining about the weather.
I'm right behind you.
You're a grown woman now.
They're not following me.
We will make every effort to do so.
Smoking stinks.
Where is your cap?
Where do you want us to start looking?
We had to stop.
There was no one about.
Don't risk your life for me.
He didn't see anything.
He just wants attention.
I have a flexible schedule.
I would like to draw.
Accidents will happen when they are least expected.
Now that I have a girlfriend, I'm happy.
It keeps you on your toes.
I wonder if he'll come tonight.
Tom is one of the more than 3,000 inmates on death row.
I have a lot of assignments to do today.
He died without having made a will.
Why does catnip drive cats nuts?
Why don't you lie down for a while?
Bring me my glasses.
You have a pretty good memory.
They abandoned the hill to enemy forces.
Can you keep a secret?
We're being watched.
What are you trying to say?
The door was locked, so I couldn't get in.
They were playing footsie under the table.
You're all invited.
Where would you like to go?
Learn Italian.
Are we leaving soon?
What keeps you awake at night?
Do you have enough money?
Is it really necessary to buy all this stuff?
The file cabinet drawers are open.
Would you mind if I watched TV for a while?
Few people will admit their faults.
Throw another log on the fire, will you?
It's junk. Throw it away.
They don't know us.
We walked along the road.
There's something I need to tell you before you leave.
I guess you think you're pretty special, don't you?
Everyone says that he's a good man.
Do you love me?
Why are you holding my hands?
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
The only thing that Tom drinks is coffee.
I went to bed a little earlier than usual.
Thank you for helping me cross the road.
Let me introduce my parents to you.
Tom is much smarter than I am.
Please help yourself to the cake.
You're my friends, both of you.
She made a mess of the work.
Which team is likely to win?
I haven't seen you in weeks.
What time does your plane leave?
Even a child knows that.
Isn't he a little young?
I'm sincere.
You're overreacting.
I was shocked to see this.
I'm kind of full.
We saw a stranger walking outside.
They're not all criminals.
Words express thoughts.
I can't believe this is happening.
I love men with beards.
I study Japanese history.
I won't do that unless you want me to.
Are you afraid of that?
I didn't know you still had friends at the IRS.
Please turn off the lights.
The President is usually accompanied by his wife when he goes abroad.
How did you get here so fast?
I guess that's OK.
She's promised to give me a ring.
I grew up around here.
She urged him to do the job.
Have you ever read Gulliver's Travels?
You don't have to lie.
Don't be so lazy.
We will make an exception of your case.
Dust had accumulated on the desk.
We must phone the police.
My room is always clean.
We were friends.
I think Tom does a fantastic job.
You'll be asked why you want to be a teacher.
I don't want to be any more burden to my parents.
How long have you been abroad?
With her heart pounding, she opened the door.
The boy pretended he could read, but he was holding the book upside down.
We got your message.
I can hardly breathe.
I don't want your legal advice.
It's better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
Please find a solution to the problem.
Everybody in that family has a car of their own.
Whales are not fish. They are mammals.
Maybe I went a little too far.
They formed a new government.
How can I repay you?
I'm proud of you guys.
I asked him to drive me home.
I am more beautiful than you.
Do you know that boy who's crying?
You're too polite.
You won't be the first.
Nothing is more important than empathy.
Please pull the rope.
When you're done with the book, put it back where you found it.
I guess so.
I don't want to be your friend.
He's an author.
I can't believe he kissed you.
She advised him to use a bicycle.
Bring along your friend.
I think it's all right now.
Is this beef or pork?
I am taking French next year.
I heard voices.
I would like my breakfast in my room at eight o'clock sharp.
His hobby is collecting stamps.
Beware of pickpockets.
I got an A in French.
This dog is big.
If you want one, you'll have to find your own.
I want to be involved.
He wants to study music and dance.
I'm glad that you can come.
Is this all they do?
I hate reptiles.
I have to make a decision.
English is spoken in Canada.
It's wonderful to be here.
I thought you might be lonely, so I came over with a bottle of wine.
May I have the menu, please?
Birds are flying in the air.
She turned her face away so he wouldn't see her tears.
She's collecting material for a book.
Somebody had drowned her in the bathtub.
She suddenly kissed me.
The first few years were difficult.
I just figured out how to do it.
I think that's a mistake.
You'll have to learn to cook.
I'll call you back later.
Nothing is forgiven.
He let the dog loose in the garden.
Shut the door.
When do you mean to start?
Can I have the paper when you're finished with it?
I forgot to lock the door.
I'm sure you never told me not to do this.
Visit us tomorrow.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
Is everything all right up there?
Where did you put your key?
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
He doesn't have any proof.
He is never lazy.
It took me a long time to get over my last relationship.
I made that one.
I was shocked to see this.
His face showed that he was annoyed.
We tried them all.
He dared not jump over the brook.
The nation mourned the death of the king.
I'm sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
Do you have a guilty conscience?
He owns a very valuable wristwatch.
I can't stop sneezing.
I have a book in my hand.
Did you already do your homework?
I thought I was happy.
She accused him of having lied to her.
When did you change your address?
He was going to leave the house when she came.
You're awesome.
You must not leave right now.
I can prove it to you.
We import grain from the United States.
You know where to find me.
What did Tom get you for Christmas?
He could not sleep because of the heat.
I am running short of money.
A squirrel hid among the branches.
I respect you for what you have done.
I do have one request.
I study mathematics.
I just need to stay calm.
He died and his soul went to hell.
I lent her 500 dollars free of interest.
I started reading the book.
I'll mail this letter today.
I made a list of people I wanted to invite to my party.
That hotel has a homey atmosphere.
I thought you didn't care about money.
He wanted to meet you.
It never occurred to me that I might be wrong.
All I can say is that I'd rather not go.
I have two or three calls lined up for today.
Would you bring me another one, please?
The lock is broken.
Bring along your friend.
Please stop playing with your hat.
Show me your papers!
My grandmother was a farmer.
It was just a matter of time.
We're both wrong.
Let's get started right away.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
You were great today.
He jumped out the window.
The meeting is all over.
He did not turn up after all.
A convict has escaped from prison.
I arrived too late and missed the train.
I just want you to be happy.
He did both at the same time.
I really want to see you.
Tom never used to eat so much junk food.
You have little to gain and much to lose.
I think we can handle the situation.
Suddenly, a good idea occurred to me.
What did he do yesterday?
Shadow him.
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
The mayor didn't like what the journalists wrote.
I do not like him either.
I don't like novels without heroes.
Your phone is ringing again.
Please look at me.
I expect your help.
I have to think this over carefully.
He mistook me for my younger brother.
She graduated with honors.
She forgave him for killing her father.
It looks like they're satisfied with the result.
I eat my breakfast at seven o'clock.
He is all but dead.
We think the reason for his success was because of hard work.
I got bored with his long talk.
I'll help you if possible.
How did you get those?
A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide pollution that we produce as a result of our activities. Some people try to reduce their carbon footprint because they are concerned about climate change.
How do I look?
Where is the newspaper?
Traffic lights work all the time.
What would you do, if you lost your job?
I have to talk to you alone.
Do you see what I mean?
Can you lend me 500 yen?
Cookie needs a walk.
I don't pretend to understand women.
Is this your bicycle?
What do you think of him?
They're cute.
I want to know how they do that.
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
Tom asked me if I had a black tie he could borrow.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
I let the cat in.
Fewer young people know how to write in longhand.
My hens laid fewer eggs last year.
I love you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
Many atrocities were committed during the war.
It did the trick.
We should learn from those who have gone before us.
I want to eat some Korean food that isn't spicy.
You're much prettier than I remember.
Everything looked nice.
A 6% yield is guaranteed on the investment.
My life would be completely empty without you.
I think Tom is loyal.
I don't feel so great.
As I got the train this morning, I met an old friend of mine.
This was a lie.
Don't be afraid.
When were potatoes introduced into Japan?
I want to work in a hospital.
When was the last time you saw the cat?
I'm not surprised you don't know the answer.
She likes jazz, and I do, too.
That's unfair.
It was the best party ever.
He always says the same thing.
Put your hat back on.
I wanted to see what would happen.
The fireman could not extinguish the flames.
Are eggs a good source of protein?
How much money do you want?
He's annoying.
Tell me again how much money you have.
We had a rest in the shade.
He isn't here now.
She tends to be late for school.
Go.
Thanks for your invitation to the party.
A nap would be good.
It's time for us to go.
Tom sipped some coffee.
He is apt to say atrocious things and to exaggerate his grievances.
I want those back when you're done.
You saved us all.
A smell of lilies filled the room.
Nothing's going to happen.
I opened a bottle of red wine.
Tom told me he's getting married.
I'm untalented.
I have food.
He kicked him while he was down.
The tree fell over in the typhoon.
I don't even know how to dance.
Since when do you have a problem with the death penalty?
I am responsible for her protection.
We had a large audience.
Can you please look the other way?
I have to go to the airport to meet my family.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
I don't have the money to buy a car.
She must be visiting England this summer.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
He didn't like school.
I already told you.
I knew you weren't really dead.
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
I never for a moment imagined that I would still be doing this kind of thing at my age.
Can't you help us?
You must not stay up late.
Tom said it was on his desk.
I've ruined everything.
I'm sure you don't want to do that.
She's out shopping for shoes.
Make yourself presentable.
I'm glad you brought that up.
He kissed me on the forehead.
Tom was heartbroken when Mary told him she was leaving him.
She did it slowly.
We're all witnesses.
The unemployment rate went up to 5%.
I came here of my own free will.
He cut the rope with his teeth.
The thermometer is an instrument for measuring temperature.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
He was busy getting ready for his journey.
Where would you like to go next?
Is my explanation clear?
You probably just want to be alone.
Tom didn't go to the dance.
Take a picture with your phone.
I'm fussy.
I'll be with you in just a second.
I do what I'm told.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
Thanks a lot for your help.
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
The government is promoting the use of domestically made products.
The door is closing.
What do you say we go skiing?
He has been warned on several occasions.
I don't care what you do with your money.
We meant well.
Her story can't be true.
She gave money.
The world is changing more and more quickly.
I want to lodge a formal complaint.
We'll all die.
I bought nine flowers.
Have we ever met before?
No one could solve the puzzle.
I have a very old stamp.
He paid the money back.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I didn't think you'd tell me.
Every time I look at this picture, I think of my father.
Do not attempt this at home.
We want new ideas, not old ones.
A dish can be spicy without being hot.
I want to stay with you.
I don't know if I should tell him.
Facebook is boring.
Lay it on the table.
Where did you get the hat?
You want something from me, don't you?
I wish you had told me what to do.
I just don't want you making any mistakes.
I'm afraid of the dark.
That's exactly what I've needed.
How many more are there?
Is this place safe?
Are you sure this is what you want?
Did anyone see you there?
I could not catch as many fish as I had expected.
I am a foreigner.
Shut the door, please.
She hasn't done her homework yet.
My uncle lived in Washington, D. C. for two years.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I've always liked baseball.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
Light the candle.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
Tom doesn't wear glasses, but he used to.
I'd like to know how you got my phone number.
Man is the only animal that can laugh.
This work is not necessarily easy.
She promised me that she'd come.
There's a possibility of war.
His sons do as they please.
They arrived at the hotel.
They chatted about the weather.
I am very pleased.
It is likely to be fine tomorrow.
Who told you to bring me here?
We saw something.
That's why I'm here.
She's very susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.
Can you wait a minute?
You have no idea how important you are to me.
Tom found his bedroom unlocked.
What did Tom give you for Christmas?
I'm fed up with her.
I'm glad you decided to come.
She is frightened of thunder.
It's urgent.
We often went skiing in the winter.
I ran into a little trouble.
You must read this book.
How could you be so cruel?
The two sides negotiated for days.
Are you certain?
We very often only come to appreciate someone or our relationship with them when we lose them.
We were too late.
Try not to laugh.
My arm is hurting badly.
She got married without her parents knowing it.
I baked it for you.
Tom believes everything Mary says.
They agreed to work together.
May I share your umbrella?
She advised him to see the dentist.
Where did you hear that?
Along with thousands of others, he fled the country.
She brought him to our place.
Not all the students were present.
I know that this is important for us all.
I have no objection to that.
Somebody saw you.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
He doesn't listen to me.
The new model is expected to be put on the market early next year.
This was part of the plan.
She opened the letter quickly.
How many words should you write?
Choose carefully.
Give me a kiss.
The same thing could be said about many other people.
A century is one hundred years.
I think you ought to postpone the meeting.
I recommend caution.
Apart from a few mistakes, your composition was excellent.
It's 3:30.
We asked Tom some questions.
You decide.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
Tom knows what's wrong.
He heard his name called.
You were perfect.
I saw her taking a walk in the park at midnight.
That looks kind of fun.
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
He goes fishing every other day.
I want you to get your own place.
I love California.
How's Tom?
The policeman captured the man who was running.
You shouldn't eat just before you go to bed.
She persuaded him to do it even though she knew it wasn't a good idea.
Policemen aren't permitted to drink on duty.
We can't add days to our life, but we can add life to our days.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
How soon can you start?
Go on, Tom, I'm listening.
You'd better start now.
Why don't you go talk to him?
Our plans are not yet concrete.
The new president was a warm and friendly man.
How did your speech go?
Don't speak with your mouth full.
I'll mow the lawn tomorrow, unless it rains.
You'll find it difficult to meet her.
He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.
I don't know if she will go there with me.
How much more work do you have?
Gold had been discovered in California.
They're angry.
Mary's my niece.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
Attendance is free.
Did I miss something?
You don't have to come.
My mother is anxious about my future.
I really am glad you're here.
I'm glad I left Boston.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
How about tonight?
You are not a coward.
I was beaten.
Is there anyone in the room?
They're all the same.
What took you so long?
I met him by accident at the airport yesterday.
Leave it where you found it.
This is big.
This purse is made of paper.
I have confidence in his abilities.
You should always wash your hands before meals.
Have a drink.
What a nice family!
The epidemic has been contained.
There were only six people at the meeting.
They're almost here.
Double-click on the icon.
Are you here alone?
They are very big apples.
That girl has a lovely doll.
If you want to succeed in life, work hard.
You can't smoke here.
Please don't tell my wife.
Everyone always asks me that.
Shall we go and eat?
Are you enjoying the play?
Even Tom is a little surprised.
No one's allowed in.
Don't you get it?
Why's Tom always here?
I baited the hook.
We want to go to the beach.
Frictions between Japan and the U.S. are easing up for a change.
Be discreet.
I want to go skiing with Tom.
I want you to return to your seat.
Your book is here.
Did you agree to do it?
Don't be upset.
They are playing chess.
We caught you.
I just wanted to talk to you.
Man is the only animal that possesses language.
We all know you're smart.
He can swim fast.
Do you think the Supersonics will go all the way to the world championships?
He is very honest.
Nothing can be worse than that.
I like to run.
We were both drunk.
That is where you are wrong.
I oppose it.
We must stay perfectly calm.
Tom forgot to bring a flashlight.
World War II ended in 1945.
I'll make you happy.
We'll work together.
There is no shame in being poor.
How much did you have to pay for the tickets?
I'm sorry I hurt you.
You can smoke in this room.
There's no point in waiting.
The future will come soon enough.
That toy is made of wood.
I'm not sure what you were thinking.
You can't trust anything he says.
I was invited by an old friend.
You don't really expect me to tell you, do you?
Tom lost his wallet.
He's stronger than you.
We're all armed.
I've been looking for them for more than one hour.
Eat a live frog every morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.
Do you need a few minutes?
His house is somewhere about here.
That's what you always do.
Is anybody home?
She lives quite close by.
The king always wears a crown.
I hope you all learn something.
That's all we can ask.
I don't know if I've ever told you, but you have beautiful eyes.
We understand why.
I think you did it.
"Are the drinks free?" "Only for ladies."
You should go to bed early.
You don't seem very pleased.
Are they busy?
Could you please tell me again where you put the key?
What was the outcome of the election?
He gave her a piece of advice.
Remove your hat.
I'm always moody.
Our TV is out of order.
Keep an eye on my suitcase while I buy my ticket.
Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.
I hope you're well rested.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
I can usually tell when someone is hiding something.
The poor talker sometimes surprises us by being a good writer.
I found something I thought I'd lost.
Don't blame the guide.
Are things going well?
I thought I was alone.
The damage will cost us a lot of money.
Guess what I bought today.
Thank you for your detailed explanation.
I want to know how you feel about this.
The library is on the second floor.
A dust storm is coming.
It was almost funny.
Can you speak French?
If he knew her phone number, he could call her.
You never have any doubts, do you?
Has he gone already?
I'm glad you weren't injured.
It's not as easy as you think.
I just want to see what will happen.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
Tom loves you. I know he does.
A new team was formed in order to take part in the boat race.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Are you ready to go?
I tripped.
Is there anything to drink in the refrigerator?
I really didn't have time.
Bring a camera.
The whole class passed the test.
I was rendered speechless by his rudeness.
Of all the films I rented, this is the only one worth seeing.
Even I don't understand.
I understood what you meant.
My uncle gave me this watch.
A cat can see in the dark.
I'm going to miss this place.
My mother told me to mow the lawn.
It's a matter of the utmost importance.
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you.
I tried to call you but I couldn't.
There are plenty of nice girls out there.
You've got to be kidding me!
I'll find out soon enough.
Nobody answered my question.
He was just in time for the last train.
There are too many people in the park.
I want you to be prepared.
You need to be prepared.
You don't know what Tom is capable of.
Do I have to undress?
I ran into an old friend at Tokyo Station.
I left one of my books at school.
Could we have a table outside?
Could I have some water?
In general, consumers prefer quantity to quality.
There are a lot of things I have to do.
I felt bad about what I did.
You're productive.
I almost kissed him.
She was panting.
This was my idea.
They never returned to their country.
You're remarkable.
I'd like to get to know you better.
He walks fast.
This is all our fault.
I admit I'm wrong.
I like the way you look.
I think this is funny.
You should call your parents more often.
I'm not going anywhere.
How did you lose it?
Tom spoke to the doctors in French.
Get me some coffee.
He caught hold of a rope and saved himself.
You'll want to look your best tomorrow.
How can we thank you?
My mouth is numb.
She is on the teaching staff.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Is there a message?
Tom is more famous than I am.
I think you're nuts.
I have no explanation.
It's misleading.
He tried to stand up.
That was very easy.
From year to year they were growing poorer.
My parents made me go there.
I wrote the note.
Have you eaten supper yet?
The United States borders Canada.
I want details.
Paparazzi thronged both sides of the red carpet.
It's driving me crazy.
I'm doing the right thing.
Everyone was hurt.
Take whichever you like.
She looks young, but as a matter of fact she is older than you are.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I smell coffee.
I'm not on duty today.
Did you clean your room?
Proceed with caution.
It was a divine intervention.
Be careful.
They're all guilty.
I will bring it right away.
I had a little help.
I don't belong here.
Should I help Tom with his homework?
The smoke alarm has never been maintained.
Do you understand everything?
Tom is studying in the library.
She suddenly became famous.
She wasn't able to meet him.
They're all liars.
I have to talk to you alone.
Nothing happens by chance.
Get it out of the house.
I volunteered.
Tom and Mary have two cats.
I'm on my way to work.
I don't know how to describe it.
When did I tell you that?
How do you live with that?
That's kind of you to say.
I don't snore.
I think that would be wise.
Stop smoking.
This isn't a government project.
I'm in the attic.
Tom and Mary danced all evening.
I thought you were serious.
We need money.
No matter what you say, I won't give up.
How does that make you feel?
I don't think I can do that.
We like Tom.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
You have the freedom to travel wherever you like.
He hit on a splendid idea.
She spent most of her life taking care of poor people.
We all have our secrets.
Are you for or against the proposal?
The mail train lost most of its mail in the fire.
Is the cat all right?
We all quit.
I really want Tom to stop doing that.
You have only to watch what I do.
I feel like I've been reborn.
Fill out this form.
Never forget to put out the fire.
Do you see much of him?
The game became exciting.
She told her children to put away their toys.
Can I share something important with you?
Some of them are teachers.
She interrupted him while he was speaking to my father.
The section chief accepted the proposal.
She caught me by the arm.
You work too much.
That's really nice.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
I'm motivated.
How long did it take?
The fog began to disappear around ten o'clock.
One does not wear a red mini skirt to a funeral.
I concentrated my attention on the lecture.
Don't worry about that.
We still have a long way to go.
I have been his greatest fan all my life.
Tom isn't a parent.
Is there anyone in the room?
This hotel is better than the other one.
He's now on the boat.
I guess I should have read it more carefully.
The chicken is overcooked.
What on earth is it?
I figured everyone was happy.
After the revolution, France became a republic.
Let's go back to the hotel.
Did I win?
Please remove your shoes before entering the house.
Our refrigerator is out of order.
Why did you choose that particular subject?
Our TV is out of order.
Are you still sleepy?
It was cloudy yesterday.
He used every chance to practice English.
You're forgetful.
We're going hunting.
Let me heat it up some leftovers for you.
"Superman" is showing at the movie theater this month.
His eyesight is failing.
Are you wearing that dress for the first time?
The mountain is covered with snow.
He dedicates himself to research.
He was imprisoned.
She's no singer.
Can you close the door?
Are we broke?
I need to go out for a while.
He brought back several souvenirs.
He lived alone in the countryside.
Can I keep this?
When do they need me?
I could hardly understand him.
I opened an account at a nearby bank.
I don't know how they did it.
I don't have a bicycle.
You're not my friend.
Two beers, please.
Stand where you are!
Don't make abrupt moves.
As you climb higher, the air becomes colder.
Let's see who can finish doing this first.
You will soon get accustomed to your new school.
A hideous monster used to live there.
A storm confined them to the house.
She doesn't have any children, does she?
His mother is worried sick about him.
Do you not know who I am?
He admitted that he wanted to escape from here.
Ask her her name.
I wish you were here.
I don't know who my mother is.
Can I speak with you?
You have a big nose.
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
Are you finished?
The car ran into a tree.
Let me do my work in peace.
Even though he was sick, the boy still went to school.
I intend to listen to it tonight.
You can't go right now.
I think we should call the police.
Close the window.
He studied very hard.
We think too much and feel too little.
They are investing a lot.
That's just not enough.
Are you their mother?
You're too hard on yourself.
Come back to the party.
I'm pressing charges.
As soon as I finish writing the report, I'll send it to you.
I will watch it.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened at school today.
I'm cured.
Could you please tell me how tall you are and how much you weigh?
You're not listening!
Perhaps we overlooked something.
This apple is bad.
Can you please repeat the question?
You smell good.
She was unkind to him.
I ran all the way home.
I haven't seen Tom since 1988.
Four percent inflation is forecast for this year.
He started singing.
Tom asked a few questions that Mary didn't want to answer.
I will work.
You really expressed yourself quite clearly.
Keep the money in a safe place.
The boy who had been missing was identified by his clothes.
I wonder who took it.
She always speaks to him in a loud voice.
I enjoy movies.
It's no use arguing with Tom.
The same holds true for Germany.
Why did you come over here?
Have you ever been hypnotized?
You really are hopeless.
Not all change is bad.
The majority of his income goes to pay his rent.
She decided to go.
They began to quarrel among themselves.
I am sorry.
I never felt like I fit in.
Why did you change your mind?
Have you seen this yet?
She bought chicken.
I walked across the street.
Show me what you bought.
I know how to handle this.
The new engine must undergo all the necessary tests.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
You're not good at this.
I'm going to be your lawyer.
Give me a coffee, please.
I don't have strep throat.
It's all about money.
If I were you, I would not do it.
He did not accept my apologies.
I got scammed.
I want to be with you more than anything.
Almost everyone was late.
"Will you have another slice of pie?" "Yes, please."
Please take this chart to the X-ray Room on the third floor.
He'll be late for the meeting.
I guess I have nothing to lose.
He has an intriguing personality.
Don't be naive.
You don't look very strong.
What do you think you're doing letting the loyalists into the castle?
You can't have this.
A great warrior radiates strength. He doesn't have to fight to the death.
I have a lot of neighbors.
I want you to think about this.
I'd like to talk with you.
I don't like your suggestion.
That's common sense.
They did not clap for us.
He has a fairly large fortune.
Tom wants to become a fireman.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I can't speak French.
You have to choose your own path.
Are you working?
This fact proves her innocence.
Tie your shoe.
There's usually someone here.
Long time, no see.
I should've asked.
Did you know him well?
I'm glad you're coming.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
We've never been to Boston.
I expect him to help me.
Who designed the White House?
He needs something to drink.
She pulled the blinds down.
She didn't want him to go out with other women.
I can't stay for dinner.
Don't interrupt me.
How do I explain this?
Truer words have never been spoken.
I've made peace with my maker. I'm ready to die.
Yours is better.
I knew Tom personally.
You're being watched.
Don't be disgusting.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
I told him not to be late.
Are you almost ready?
You're always anticipating trouble.
I want you to go back.
He's used to speaking in public.
What just happened?
Do you eat lunch at your desk?
I'll come back later.
We'll try.
I think he'll never return.
I almost shot you.
He is poor, but happy.
You're stalling.
No one agreed with him.
She can't write or read.
You're probably right.
She can count from one to ten.
Are you enjoying it?
This is a story about love and friendship.
Tom is now the star of a reality show.
This is a difficult situation.
He was a disagreeable old man.
I'll meet you down at the station tomorrow.
Everyone knows what happened next.
Tom kept his opinion to himself.
Put that book aside for me.
Sorry, but I am unable to do so.
I prefer to walk.
He is likely to win the game.
I heard a voice I didn't recognize.
New York is worth visiting.
Tom always makes fun of John because of his dialect.
I have a sharp pain in my chest.
Was he home alone?
Don't be so impatient.
I don't think I can do that.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
I found somebody.
I felt excited.
Why are you alone?
I can't find my purse.
He got his car washed at the filling station.
I think I see something.
Did you like Boston?
You didn't work hard enough.
The meeting was just about over.
She will be a college student next spring.
I can't find my wallet.
That sounds familiar.
I took control of the situation.
Do you like singing?
It is cold outside today.
I think Tom left.
I think you need some sleep.
Anything new?
She pressured him to quit.
Tom met John in prison.
We're starved.
Start a new paragraph here.
I hope you don't do that.
Can I do anything?
There's no difference.
I earn my living as best I can.
What do you need?
She lay awake all night.
Tom is a very dangerous man.
What does it look like?
Did you buy a new phone?
What could possibly have gone wrong?
He ran the risk of having an accident.
Isn't there anyone you know?
I knew it would happen sooner or later.
Let me try.
The earth goes around the sun.
Your English has improved a lot.
The kids are finally asleep.
The poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator.
I'm really concerned about your future.
I can't hear what they're saying.
You are trusted by every one of us.
This will be on the test.
Tom thought that Mary was asleep.
I have a rough idea where it is.
I thought you wanted to wait.
I believe she is a charming girl.
She betrayed you.
He sits in this chair when he watches television.
The more you study, the more you discover your ignorance.
He is more crafty than wise.
You look like your dad.
I will keep your advice in mind.
What's that your wearing?
The fact is that I have no money with me.
In 1683, the Turks besieged Vienna for the second time.
I liked having you here tonight.
I didn't see your car outside.
I think I've figured out which horse is most likely to win the race.
You have my number. Call me sometime.
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young.
I was young and stupid.
I don't plan to get divorced from you unless you give me a valid reason.
I will stop you.
You can't blame this on us.
She said she would be back soon.
I had to see you.
I enjoyed talking to him.
I hate politics.
I want to do something for Tom.
I worked this morning.
Don't shoot!
Since I'm here, let me help you.
Our little boy is growing up.
It requires more courage to suffer than to die.
Don't try to do two things at a time.
What's the weather like?
It seems to me that she has a tendency to exaggerate.
Any comments are welcome.
The bridge is being repainted.
Will you be here tomorrow?
You've got bags under your eyes.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
There's a lot of danger during a big storm.
I had nothing to hide.
It happened here.
I drank three cups of coffee this morning.
I swear I didn't do anything.
Didn't you know that Tom could play the guitar?
Tom sang me a song.
What a fiasco!
He was educated at Oxford.
He crushed the box.
Who's to say which is better?
I need some time to think.
He has a very good voice.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go to the concert.
Are you doing something special on your birthday?
I don't want to hear anything more about that.
I laughed so hard I almost cried.
She was on the point of leaving.
The doctor did a good job on my leg.
Tom was a baseball player.
I wrote to you from Iraq.
How you've grown!
I was pardoned.
I haven't done this since high school.
That was a costly mistake.
Did you tell everybody all about me?
I ran outside.
He broke into a house.
You had plenty of opportunity.
You're callous.
We'll talk about this later.
I think this will do.
Get ready for some action.
Tom punched Mary.
My passport is no longer valid.
I read a lot of magazines.
Are you sure about this?
He unbuttoned his shirt.
Is this information correct?
Is eating a clove of garlic every day beneficial to your health?
I'm glad things went so well.
You've given me good advice.
I totally disagree.
I feel I could've done better.
They live near the school.
Is one thousand yen enough?
He needs to speak English.
I am busy.
Aren't you embarrassed?
I think we can go faster.
At any rate, I hope you can come.
It's a nice day to eat outside.
There's no reason to change our plans.
If you're smart, you'll cash out while you're ahead.
I won't put up with this any longer.
We must observe the rules.
You look European.
I like to be thorough.
What happened here yesterday?
We have to be at work by nine.
He went through many hardships in his youth.
I will sue you.
I went there for the purpose of meeting him.
Do you have some money?
Be kind to those around you.
Do you have a bicycle?
There isn't any more time.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
He was stunned.
That's all true.
He's the prom king and she's the prom queen.
Where is your house?
I bet you're wondering how this works.
The tree fell down.
He criticized me for neglecting my duty.
Tom is a former student of mine.
What's in front of you?
Tom found the hat Mary was looking for in the basement.
That's a funny thing about people like you, you don't want to get your hands dirty.
You can rely on me.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
The bill amounted to 100 dollars.
Tom was motivated.
It was raining hard, so we played indoors.
He is always day-dreaming.
My children were born in Boston.
Don't let him read this.
We're not interested.
Don't make stupid jokes.
I must resist.
Follow us.
Where are all the others?
It's safer.
I persuaded him to go to the party.
I like working with you.
In what kind of situations would you do that?
It was nowhere to be seen.
That's just what he needed.
I met Tom there.
It was never like that.
I'll come without fail tomorrow morning.
Tom hates Halloween.
The book costs fifteen dollars.
All eyes were glued on the TV set as the election results came in.
It won't take long to finish the job.
He lost his life in an accident.
I made a lot of mistakes.
We've been warned.
He is no match for his wife.
What have you done with your car?
I have something I'd like to say.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Why are you being weird?
Love is hard to define.
There's nothing unusual to report.
How's your cold?
I can't confirm this.
Have a nice flight.
He walked across the street.
The place was packed.
I still think this is the best choice.
They crashed.
Tom first met Mary at a cafe in Boston.
Somebody laughed.
Those are my books.
He grabbed my arm.
You can't be sure of that.
We are about to leave here.
I like music, especially classical music.
Why doesn't he tell them?
Let me off at the train station, please.
He can do anything he sets his mind to.
One year has twelve months.
You're not usually like this.
It seems to me that something is wrong.
Is your father a teacher?
I'm sure she'll leave early.
Help me.
I'd rather not.
Don't say that word ever again.
The officer inspired his men to be brave.
He was not conscious of his own mistake.
This is the worst thing I've ever done.
She brought me a cup of tea.
He deserves punishment.
He became a Catholic.
He graduated from some rinky-dink college in Oklahoma.
She won't give up easily.
What did you turn up?
She isn't lonely now.
She is quite pretty, but looks unhealthy.
Where did all the bread go?
Don't try to make me angry.
Why didn't she help you?
Three years have passed since then.
Probably he will come soon.
It's fall now.
Don't forget to pick me up at 6 o'clock tomorrow.
That's what I'm asking you to do.
She promised to meet him last night, but she never showed up.
Where did everybody go?
Didn't your parents teach you anything?
My brother was threatened by someone waving a gun.
I think you did very well.
He got his watch fixed.
She spoke to me in Spanish.
I'll be your teacher.
I'd like to buy a washing machine.
You can't just come in here and start ordering people around.
I can't understand why you are so critical of him.
My mother is busy cooking dinner.
The government made no move to solve the housing problem.
You've got to take care of yourself.
He will play tennis with his friends.
Do you have school on Saturdays?
No one knew quite what to say.
I was threatened.
Not every child likes apples.
You're being malicious.
The roof of my house is red.
I can see the light.
Some companies guarantee their workers a job for life.
I have backstage passes.
I am a professor.
He is far from happy.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
Scallops are on sale today.
They agreed on everything.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
Do you remember your grandfather?
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
How did the railway accident at Tokyo Station happen?
Did you get the check?
We wish him the best in his future endeavors.
Did I do that?
Who's your boyfriend?
I have less and less time for reading.
He has two cats.
Don't talk nonsense!
Is there a telephone nearby?
This food is too salty.
The rain lasted for three days.
No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't please him.
I feel weak.
I'm busy, so I can't go.
You're a good liar.
I can't stand it here any longer. I need a change of scenery.
What have you done with the books?
Do you want to make me happy?
Can you identify them?
How many books did you read?
Everybody likes polite people.
I find learning languages to be very rewarding.
I decided to come to Japan last year.
I can't understand this sign's meaning.
I can't believe that you enjoyed that movie.
Does someone have the exact time, please?
It is terrible weather today.
Start writing.
Peace has returned after three years of war.
I will wait a week.
You don't sound very optimistic.
I did it many times.
Do you know what they want?
You can't be sure of that.
That was well worth the trouble.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Don't you find it interesting?
I wish you had told me the truth.
Any book will do.
No one came up here.
How did you get out of your room?
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
Can you pass me the salt, please?
Speak slowly, please.
Here are your keys.
I need some time to think about it.
I don't think you're schizophrenic.
That's all I knew.
They were afraid of you.
Let me deal with him.
The capital of Japan is Tokyo.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Tom followed Mary into the room.
I didn't really think it would happen.
Why don't you give up smoking?
What did you do with those books?
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
Does she know you?
I think I'm losing my mind.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
This is the house I lived in when I was young.
You shouldn't see her now.
Could you call me back a bit later?
Why are you two always fighting?
You don't have to apologize.
Mary's husband is rich.
You're not very funny.
I'm sorry for being late.
I couldn't lie to you.
Help yourself, please.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
This is impossible for me.
I told you to call me.
What happened at that intersection?
I'm looking for a bag for my wife.
Tom walked across the street.
This is bad.
Look at the sign just ahead of you.
I spent hours looking for the key that I had dropped.
I realize I may not be the most desirable man in the world, but I still hope you'll consider going out with me.
He can read English easily.
Tom doesn't know how to milk a cow.
Tom doesn't know the whole story.
Tom offered to pay for the damages.
Call me when it's done.
I'll leave when she comes back.
Do you think students are given enough time to eat lunch?
Few girls were late for school.
I had to see it for myself.
Shall I cut it in half?
You must get rid of that bad habit.
What's with everybody?
It's so good to finally meet you.
They knew exactly what they were doing.
Generally, men are taller than women.
How many books can I take out at one time?
I keep saying that I'm innocent, but no one will listen.
Just tell me what you want.
I'd like to get a copy of that report.
I remember that feeling.
It could just be your imagination.
I remember you.
Talking to your plants doesn't help them grow faster.
We're all friends.
I can't leave now.
We haven't heard anything from them yet.
He looks old for his age.
Did she go to the station to see her teacher off?
I think it's unlikely that aliens similar to what we see in the movies have ever visited our planet.
None of these things look tempting.
That explains it.
More than half of the residents are opposed to the plan.
I know nothing yet.
He died of cancer last year.
I used my imagination.
Do you know anyone in Australia?
They wanted to know what happened.
I expect you know all about it.
I like to be early.
Tom was sure of himself.
That was, as it were, part of the job.
Don't forget to pay the phone bill.
I wish I could stay longer.
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
I can't find the hotel.
I'm a cop.
He cheated on me.
I wish you had told me what to do.
I went to the zoo yesterday.
I'd be happy to sing for you.
I don't really like you.
I used to be the same age as you.
I work for an oil company.
It's still raining.
That way I kill two birds with one stone.
Are we being charged with something?
I want it.
I am seeing my uncle tomorrow.
He was able to read the book.
Where's your mother?
Will you help me with my English homework?
She wouldn't let him in.
I don't care who Tom is talking to.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
Don't kid yourself.
I don't think they heard us.
He's a university student.
I think we're going to win.
Tom showed me Mary's picture.
I thought I heard you.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
We love each other.
I don't want any problems.
Tom does only what he wants to do.
Hand in your papers.
Tom is traveling by himself.
No one is there.
My brother is an idiot.
There's no guard.
I knew all about that.
I worry too much.
What did you learn?
Do you have a violin?
Where did you go to college?
The smell of dirty socks makes me want to throw up.
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
Very fat people waddle when they walk, though few of them realize it.
I just stayed quiet.
Can you fix the flat tire now?
I gave each child three pieces of candy.
I continued reading the book.
Do you trust me?
I heard them coming.
When does it end?
I paid about 50 bucks.
I want you to tell me what you really think of me.
She was voted prom queen.
The teacher made him stay after school.
That's a promise.
He's cruel and heartless.
We did not help him, so he made it by himself.
Did you take him home?
What you are is more important than what you have.
I really want to believe you.
This is an order.
The writer is well known to us.
I want to trust you.
We have an appointment.
I'd be glad to tell Tom how to do that.
Tom broke his leg in a cycling accident.
You must control yourself.

The air is bad here. Will you open the window?
I can't get involved in this.
The pain was agonizing.
Only I could answer the question correctly.

Tom, do you still love me?
Do you have a passport?
You're mistaken. That's not what I said.
I want to talk to your superior.
You cannot kill yourself by holding your breath.
I think Tom said he was from Boston.

He asked me to go to a movie with him.

Don't miss this amazing opportunity.
I never stopped loving you.
Tom needed a good job.
Don't get any ideas.
How many of them were there?
Can I call you back?
I told you not to call me on weekends.
We like him.
No wonder they turned down her offer.
I think we can work something out.
I had some time to think.
He was sentenced to death.
It's supposed to get colder and snow later today.
"Does she play tennis?" "Yes, she does."

By the way, how many of you are keeping a diary?
Don't dwell too much upon the subject.

He went there, never to return.
Thanks a lot.
I feel the same way about it as you do.
I can't live that kind of life.
He has a book.
I don't feel like getting up.
He proposed an alternate plan.

I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
He made a joke about it.
I wonder how that works.
Where did you learn French?
I want to talk about the future.
In all probability, the cabinet will fall.
His office is very close to mine.
Have you finished your preparations for the trip?
I don't need anything.
You were perfect.
She intended to go shopping with her mother, but her mother was busy.
Your birthday is coming soon.
I was overwhelmed.
It felt like a dream.
Who told you?
They clung together for warmth.
I had to get away from here.
Tell me where you went.
No one trusts him any more.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I didn't do anything illegal.
This fruit doesn't taste good.
Both of them seem suspicious.
I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I made her cry.
She declined to say more about it.
He tried to comfort her, but she kept crying.
How many guards were there?
Lock your doors.
I want to know where you heard that.
One thing you should know about me is that I'm obsessed with punctuality.
That's very true.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
My watch has been stolen.
I want something cold to drink.
Her voice trembled with rage.
I never make a speech without being nervous.
Do not fear the unexpected, but be prepared for it.
I got a telescope for my birthday.
This is the lady I spoke of yesterday.
We'll begin shortly.
Who did you speak with?
Are these bananas ripe?
You have overstepped your authority.
Do you want to cancel the meeting?
He is telling a lie.
I just don't want you making any mistakes.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
We reached the top of the mountain.
What did she actually say?
No, I didn't go.
Tom is usually much busier than Mary.
Go back to your room.
I don't think I can help you.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
I know what they are.
They're suffering from malaria.
Our team lost.
I stopped laughing.
How old are your children now?
Tom asked Mary why she was buying so much food.
They're all nuts.
Please phone him.
Didn't I lend you some money yesterday?
What is the book about?
I don't have a home.
What's all the excitement?
She is looking for her car keys.
It happened so fast.
He is lying through his teeth.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
What do we have to do?
I heard someone scream.
How are you?
I don't feel like dancing.
My doctor told me to give up smoking.
I put my clothes in the dryer.
A tall building was built next to my house.
There was a large audience at yesterday's concert.
You don't have to sing.
I sometimes dream about Tom.
That's a good guess.
I've got plans for you.
I'm not leaving you.
You'd better give up smoking.
How old were you when you got married?
Is it true that chicken soup will cure a cold?
Don't lie.
Autumn came and the leaves started to fall.
They usually go to school from Monday to Friday.
He was always pulling my leg when we worked together.
Your Chinese is awesome already.
It is still light outside.
He cracked up.
I imagined that.
Who was absent from school last week?
What do you have in your bag?
Why do you feel that way?
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
I always believe you.
The crow spread his wings.
I felt naked.
We can see many stars tonight.
I was just making sure.
I appreciate your situation.
It's perfect.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
She gave him something to drink.
I'm opening my presents now.
Tom calls Mary every night.
Who knows what's going to happen?
She is about my age.
Tom is exactly like his father.
Where do you all live?
I finally passed that test.
I lost your phone number.
Speaking in English is fun.
Let's clear this up right now.
He was crushed to death.
Tom is now in jail.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
She has totally changed her character.
Might I ask your name and address?
My hobby is reading.
He happened to catch sight of a rare butterfly.
She glanced shyly at him.
We have to escape.
I don't think you should quit your job.
I wasn't entirely sure myself.
There is an error in this sentence.
Get real!
I was aching from the injury.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
I'm tired of arguing.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Help me out here.
Are you still studying French?
Sit wherever you like.
We all had hope.
Please remain seated.
You can go there.
You won't regret this. I promise.
The building collapsed in the earthquake.
Do you really want to lead this kind of life?
The sun is beating down and there's no shade in sight.
Paris is the capital of France.
The snow stopped falling.
She came with good news.
I'm glad to see you here.
You've got to wake up.
Tom gets up at six every morning.
I'd like to meet Tom as soon as possible.
I promise you I'll look after you.
We need to make a big decision.
Cool down.
It's not enough.
I don't want to live by your rules.
They acted on the information.
How much thinner do you want to be?
No one seems to listen to us anymore.
We're on the same page now.
They shot the film in an actual desert.
I'll have her come here.
Her feelings are easily hurt.
This is our house.
We have to consider the possibility that Tom was involved in the robbery.
She wore a red dress.
I know that Tom knows.
They work hard.
I could recite the story by heart.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
I think we shouldn't have gotten married.
Are you out of your mind?
She was a Wakahata before she married.
I can't tell him apart from his brother.
His wife opened the door for him.
Rome has a lot of ancient buildings.
Why are they fighting?
I stared at the ceiling.
Tom asked Mary to the prom.
I can buy one.
My wife is obsessed with cleaning.
The cat arched its back.
Connect the two cables together.
Please feel free to ask questions.
She bought him a sweater, but he hated the color.
At last, we got to the lake.
Where's your boyfriend?
Where's your house?
Do you think her story is false?
Please tell me where to park my car.
They are collecting contributions for the church.
It's impossible to learn English in a month.
The government compensated the farmers for the damage to the crops.
Their patience was about to give out.
What do you base your theory on?
I really like your paintings.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
This knife has served me well.
Did you tell everybody all about me?
The boy hid behind the door.
Barack Obama is a Christian.
If it rains, we will go to the art museum.
I totally agree with what you say.
Stay in the car.
Today is Tuesday.
He and I have a near-telepathic understanding of each other. No sooner does one of us say something than the other is already responding.
It looks like Tom was able to get what he wanted.
I agree with you to a degree.
Many countries depend on agriculture.
I don't understand why this keeps coming loose.
They had a heated discussion.
Keep trying.
You're acting like a child.
It feels like a dream.
Don't tell my wife.
I know Tom lied.
What grade are you in?
Tom studies French.
The pain is gone.
He left a minute ago.
Isn't it wonderful how things work out?
How do you think I felt?
Maybe she forgot my birthday.
How do you pronounce your name?
It's not for the faint of heart.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.
It was just a coincidence.
Where would you like to go?
I wonder why he did that.
He was watching television all day.
That's not completely accurate.
I should've added more salt.
I'd have waited for you.
Can you imagine what life would be like without television?
Can you eat something there?
What's so hard to believe?
I was careful.
I had no sooner left the house than it began to rain hard.
I'm as curious as you are.
I had no work yesterday.
You don't have to answer.
Finally, he reached his goal.
I've never told anyone.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
Even if he is busy, he will come.
Now let's celebrate.
You're alone, aren't you?
I didn't break it.
There is no chair in this room.
Everyone recognized his skill.
I was sorry.
Try to do your best.
Something is wrong with the engine of this car.
I want to travel around the world.
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
We spent the day in the open air.
His mother sat up all night waiting for her son.
I just can't help you right now.
I'm sure I'll win the tennis match.
Take an umbrella. It's likely to rain.
I wish I could go to the party with you.
There's no entertainment for young people around here.
We went to Rome, where we stayed a week.
This book belongs to you.
The mayor granted our request.
Mary is as tall as Tom is.
Since he was dressed in black, he looked like a priest.
Can we just drop it?
In Japan, there are lots of hot springs.
Speak louder so that everyone may hear you.
My friend ended up taking the rap for a crime he didn't commit.
I hope you have a good time!
I think it's going to be fun.
Hand over your weapons.
Don't die on me.
What do you say to calling it a day?
If you want to know, just ask.
What floats your boat?
Just get back to work.
She has a comfortable income to live on.
Tom has no prior criminal record.
She lit the candles.
No one can get in or out.
Tom was afraid that they'd lock him up and throw away the key.
How do you pronounce your name?
I lay on my bed.
That pretty bird did nothing but sing day after day.
I keep my hammer in the toolbox.
I tried again.
I remember seeing him.
Please close the door behind you.
They did a good job.
I'm learning so much from you.
I agree with everything you've said.
They were playing footsie under the table.
I like old cars.
The country is in a bad economic state.
Maybe I'm just crazy.
The young man put out his hand and I shook it.
You were right and I was wrong.
Are you on Facebook?
A pick is a long handled tool used for breaking up hard ground surfaces.
He's just kidding you.
The market is completely saturated.
That's very easy.
They went crazy.
The shop is just in front of the station.
I didn't think you would come.
I left it unlocked.
Could you give me a ride?
Can you pitch?
You're going to love our food.
It's your turn.
Circumstances did not permit me to help you.
Have you heard that a burglar broke into my neighbor's house?
Is this a river?
We'll see who answers first.
Everybody's a suspect.
I'll come and see you later.
It's starting to grow on us.
It is impossible for you to do so.
Could you tell me how to use the telephone?
I'm sure that he will take part in the contest.
What a beautiful garden!
Carry her to the operating room.
People look at things differently depending on whether they are rich or poor.
If you heat ice, it melts.
Tom is still in the bathroom.
Did you leave a tip?
I'm not really that old.
It is an option.
I'm getting off the train at the next stop.
People might think you're stupid if you do that.
I called for help.
You've risked enough.
What is over there?
What could they possibly want from us?
I really need to go home and catch some zees.
Let's get rid of all this stuff.
We should not have done that. It was wrong.
What does this mean for Tom?
Who do you know here?
Will the ice bear our weight?
I hope you brought coffee.
I'm vegetarian.
You don't look pleased to see me.
We're half right.
We see each other at the supermarket now and then.
My mother is not always at home.
I'll get something to drink for both of you.
I want to be pampered.
He was finally forced to resign.
I just didn't want to upset you.
How far are you prepared to go?
Hitler led Germany into war.
Do what you want.
Choose the one you like.
I was naive.
I'll make this up to you.
I'm letting you go.
Hey everyone, please listen.
He fumbled with the keys before finding the right one.
Do you know anything about it?
Don't be ashamed of yourself.
I have an old car.
How did you arrive at this conclusion?
She bears an uncanny resemblance to Marilyn Monroe.
How about going for a swim?
You'll have to ask Tom that.
It's merely a joke.
Why did you name your dog Cookie?
Hope of finding the child alive is fading rapidly.
He adapted himself to his new life.
This flower is the most beautiful of all flowers.
There you go again.
She is always smoking.
Who picked you for this mission?
I want to see for myself.
You have changed since I saw you last year.
I will choose one.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
She plays golf every weekend.
Tom waited, but nobody came.
All of them are not poor.
He helped me fix my watch.
I couldn't stand looking at it.
Who hired you?
Do you think I'm crazy?
It is difficult for him to solve the problem.
Would you draw me a map?
I bet you didn't know that.
He hopes to go abroad.
They have no natural predators.
I had to walk here because my car broke down.
I think we can do better.
Take a walk.
Come on, spit it out!
I'll sing.
Did you question them?
That's plenty for today.
His hair has turned white.
You can skate safely on this side of the lake.
The clock is made in Switzerland.
I can't take any more of this.
A sin confessed is half forgiven.
If you're not happy, quit.
My uncle went to Mexico in 1983, never to come back.
I am going to swim a lot this summer.
Call me if you need help.
I don't see any reason why I have to apologize.
When you've finished reading that book, I'd like to read it.
Tom will be here in fifteen minutes.
I know how to handle this.
I'll let you know when I need you.
How much time do you actually spend thinking about the future?
I don't want to see you here again.
You're so pathetic.
I slept a lot.
Tom didn't tell me why.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Everyone is exhausted.
Tom would never leave Mary.
What are the origins of the Olympics?
I guess you know I've missed you.
We have to do without sugar.
To tell the truth, she is my cousin.
She speaks Chinese.
I made reservations.
Would you close the window?
The drunk driver damaged a tree.
He thinks only of making money.
I'd like to go somewhere else now.
I like talking.
I'm sure everything will be OK.
He is proficient in English.
That plan failed.
You should try it.
They found us.
You don't have to go.
She passed away peacefully in her sleep.
I know who that is now.
I have nothing to say against it.
I like reading.
I wasn't always this fat.
I don't know if we want to do that.
She pretended not to hear him yesterday.
This is for your own safety.
He had his secretary type the report.
Tom is very smart.
Stop. You're making me blush.
I've already told everybody to go home.
She planted roses in the garden.
You're callous.
What makes you think I want your help?
What should they do in this situation?
We aren't afraid of death.
You're impressed, aren't you?
It's hard to steal from a thief.
That's the way.
I think what Tom is doing is great.
The house was surrounded by fields.
The soldiers resisted the enemy attack.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
Are you all finished here?
This is a special day for all of us.
He tried to make his wife happy, but in vain.
Call me when you are ready to go.
His hair is black in color and long.
Are you tired?
My friend is beside me.
He ran so he would get there on time.
You may go if you choose.
We heard the sound of gunshots.
She married a local boy.
Maybe Tom is in love.
Can you help me with my work?
She insisted that he play the piano.
Compared with yours, my car is small.
She has not come here yet.
As of tomorrow, this e-mail address will be invalid.
He set off to Paris.
Careless driving causes accidents.
He believes in the existence of ghosts.
I am ready to follow you.
I've got to get going.
I'm sorry, I just wanted to help.
Don't forget to call your parents.
If you don't eat, you'll die.
I'm not busy right now.
It's crowded today.
Are you through with your work?
Don't worry. It's OK.
That child grew a lot in a short amount of time.
We had to shut the window because of the mosquitoes.
She's getting on all right.
Really?
I can't find anything.
You don't look very good.
I went skiing in Canada last winter.
We have to do this the right way.
Don't play with fire.
You're not bleeding.
That's not uncommon.
Tom just turned thirty.
We haven't seen you in a while.
The sky is full of stars.
You're not normal.
The airplane took off on time.
Tom lives on the same street as me.
The world has changed.
Don't be sorry.
Please stop talking.
The eating of delicious food is one of the most intense and poignant pleasures of life.
Tom doesn't hate you, Mary.
You're demented.
How's the party going?
Will you pick me up at seven tomorrow morning?
Can you think of any reason why that might be the case?
I was scratched by a cat.
I'm as tired as tired can be.
Do you like English?
No one has come forward to claim responsibility for what happened.
We're a bit late.
Not everybody can be a poet.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
I don't have a good feeling about this.
You seem happy.
That shouldn't be much of a problem.
I need the key to decode this message.
Tom advised Mary not to believe everything she reads on the Web.
Some of the apples in the box were rotten.
I'm contagious.
Don't interfere in other people's affairs.
I'm beginning to see a pattern.
Would you like more coffee?
I want to talk now.
My dog ate it.
I'm really busy today, otherwise I would accept.
My friend broke up with his girlfriend and now he wants to go out with me.
You're the master.
I'll tell you why.
It's an old custom.
Where did they get all this?
I'm stunned.
Did you write your name?
It's your problem, not mine.
The ice is too thin to bear your weight.
Do you want me to lose my job?
Please call me before you come.
You need to accept your role.
Try to calm down.
If you had been a little more patient, you could have succeeded.
She advised him to see a lawyer, so he did.
Tom fired Mary.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
He lives frugally.
I'd like to ask one or two questions myself.
How bad is the damage?
Do any of your friends play guitar?
Write carefully and legibly.
I wouldn't recommend that.
It has nothing to do with luck.
The police think that Tom poisoned himself.
I'd like to go with you.
I thought you'd left.
Tom picked up a book, opened it, and started reading it.
I don't feel like playing either.
You can use this pen for the time being.
I knew Tom would be heartbroken.
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
We're not mad.
Let's try to sleep.
It's right in front of your eyes.
Did I give you enough time?
Your time is up.
I met your father yesterday.
It's a lot easier than I thought.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
That affair made him famous.
I'd never played that game before.
Her composition is very good except for a few errors in spelling.
You're too old for me.
He kept his hat on.
Our teacher seemed surprised.
The students could not give an answer.
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
You remind me of somebody.
I used to not do that.
I'd like to run a few more tests.
What do you think of the new teacher?
We're still getting to know each other.
Listening to music is a great way to relax.
His grandmother looks healthy.
Just follow them.
I want a piece of cake.
How long were you gone?
I am calling to make an appointment with you.
I told you to leave.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Tom is now very angry with me.
It's not a dog.
I'm beginning to get curious.
She doesn't know who built those houses.
My work is not as easy as yours.
I used to be your age.
I'm not very good at it.
Do you want to sit down?
I want Tom to have a job that he loves.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Let's turn and go back now.
The baby has been crying for a long time.
He shared his soup with me.
Why did you keep that a secret?
It was not a complete victory.
I'll miss your cooking.
Tom took a quick shower.
Tom isn't accustomed to working at night.
You underestimate your importance.
I don't need a haircut.
When would you like to begin?
It's complex.
How often do you check your messages?
Have a look at the world map.
I was lonely.
The floor gave way.
Personal computers are very useful.
A dog's sense of smell is much keener than a human's.
Tom is hardly ever at home.
Tom asked Mary to pass him the gravy.
I took this picture a week ago.
The cat is in the box.
They do it faster than me.
She called him every other day.
Invite whoever you like.
How far away do you think that ship is?
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world.
Would you like some coffee?
Yesterday was a good day.
Everybody wants to protect you.
I don't remember anything happening.
I didn't think we could do that.
The Japanese live mainly on rice.
I'll try to contact Tom.
"What will you have to do?" asked her friend.
It's our car.
I wasn't involved.
Don't try to do too much.
Call me.
His chances of being elected are good.
I was told to contact you.
I'm sure.
My dream is to study abroad.
Is this time different?
I said nothing, which made him more furious.
I'd like a word with you in private.
Is there anything you want me to buy for you?
I think it's time for me to join the fight.
This is your final warning.
I just want to die.
We rented a canoe.
Don't you have any change?
She says that she is happy.
Production of rice has decreased.
Do you know where your father went?
I don't know how to make you happy.
Tell the truth to Tom.
I would like a cup of coffee.
Are we alone?
A ceasefire began a few hours later.
Are you going home by bus?
That woman has wrongly accused me.
I'm not available.
In most countries, teachers do not receive high wages.
He's waiting for you at home.
Tom poured Mary a glass of water.
Don't underestimate my power.
I've never met a man as stupid as you.
You're not sick.
She used to help him with his homework.
The boy feared the dark.
How are your parents doing?
We're quite certain of that.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
They're looking for Tom.
Come on, drinks are on me.
My work is almost finished.
That's hers.
My brother is stupid.
It says on the label to take two tablets.
We can talk.
He painted all the walls green.
You won't be harmed.
The teachers greeted the children.
I want to practice with you.
He won the prize last week.
I think this tie will go great with that shirt.
I have no idea what to expect.
He took over the business from his father.
I'm not making any plans.
Tom lost the bet.
The cloning of human embryos is prohibited by law.
Would you mind if I drank the rest of the milk?
She's wearing a loose coat.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
I would rather you came on Friday than on Thursday.
I'm able to swim.
That's clear.
I guess you know I've missed you.
I was a student at that time.
We should get going.
There are more cars on the road in the summer than in the winter.
Let's eat out for a change.
I haven't seen any of his pictures.
What do you think you're doing?
He can't have been ill.
Since I'm here, let me help you.
Don't be angry.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
I had no intention of doing so.
It was in the 1920s that a big earthquake destroyed Tokyo.
Do men cry?
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
He is the father of three children.
It's not actually raining yet.
The lake water is very cold.
I'd like to believe that's true.
I rode a horse for the first time yesterday.
I did find something.
You should've never come here.
He struck a match.
Tom told me later that he wasn't really married.
I don't need you to take care of me.
I can't just leave. I have to tell the boss I'm leaving.
I must make up for lost time.
He must be severely punished.
Can you push the door open?
I think it's time for me to study.
These shirts are all the same size.
I have a reservation for today.
I want something good to eat.
How would you like it if I hit you?
What could possibly go wrong?
I want something cold to drink.
And now you wish perhaps to learn on less familiar traps?
It is hardly worth discussing.
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
I want you to think about this.
It was no one's fault.
She didn't intend to let him drive.
I don't know the answer to that.
He is afraid of Father.
He was killed in the war.
You're making a terrible mistake.
Today is the fifth day of continual stock price decline.
They don't make 'em like they used to.
The fire was on the first floor.
Everyone was friendly to the new girl.
Tom may not be able to come.
Shall we order?
I did what Tom told me to do.
School is not a waste of time.
What insects have you eaten?
You must start at once.
Tom didn't mean it.
It's all happening so fast.
What exactly don't you get?
Tom isn't very confident.
It rained heavily all day long.
I can hardly believe it.
I applied for a visa.
You're the one who trained me.
He retired at sixty.
Tom is as old as Mary.
That's no good.
The wound left a scar on my arm.
Tom ordered a drink.
I share his opinion.
I just got your message.
They often go on picnics by bicycle.
Tom and Mary were speaking in French, so I had no idea what they were talking about.
He sat with his legs crossed.
The weather forecast is not reliable at all.
No one will talk.
Tom took off his shirt.
I can't find anything.
Tom is allergic to eggs.
Please obey the school rules.
The mayor presented him with the key to the city.
Tom wants Mary to be happy.
Eventually, my curiosity overcame my fear.
His income is three times larger than mine.
She gave him a big smile.
What would you like to do while you're here?
You're very talented.
I have to dress up.
You broke the washing machine.
I lather my face before shaving.
Has he failed again?
He will always be with you.
Do you remember how we met?
Tom is a close personal friend of mine.
Don't be so impatient.
What's causing the delay?
My father is on the wagon.
I want to play chess with Tom.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Generally speaking, the climate of Japan is mild.
I've got plenty of time.
Where do you watch television?
This bread is really delicious. Where did you buy it?
We bought a round table.
They're traitors.
You should be out of here by tomorrow.
I'll remember you forever.
I have to button my jacket.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
What're you all dressed up for?
I was busy all day.
I don't have any friends.
Lower your voice.
The fire brigade was on the scene within five minutes of receiving the call.
I'm not trying to impress anyone.
Come and dance with me.
What for?
I just assumed everything was going to be OK.
He says that he has no memory of the evening.
I would rather stay here than go there.
Whether the problem is important or unimportant, you must solve it.
How old might his grandfather be?
Tom said he found his keys.
We're standing.
He advised us against doing it.
This is doable.
He drinks his coffee black every time.
The king's son was kidnapped.
I don't know what the big deal is.
I don't know how long it'll take.
He's likely to be chosen.
He came in spite of bad weather.
Look at me when I talk to you!
She was absent because she caught a cold.
I'm as old as you.
There are many Americans who can speak Japanese.
He hates his life.
The problem was I couldn't speak French.
What he said would happen has happened.
You know her name, don't you?
I used to be your age.
I want to talk to you about this report.
You're out of booze.
There were no survivors.
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
What a strange woman!
I don't have time to answer any questions.
They gathered at a farm in New York State.
Why are you all sad?
You can rely on me.
He never laughs at my jokes.
It is not a real mansion.
Being written in great haste, this letter has quite a few mistakes.
I've seen that.
Can you walk?
Those were the saddest hours of my life.
Does this ring a bell?
All of a sudden, she began to laugh.
It's against my religion.
Choose books carefully.
It's cold in here.
Put some music on.
She left her ticket at home.
My sister often looks after the baby.
I'll be home by midnight at the latest.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Did anyone visit me during my absence?
I'm afraid you can't do that.
I do that all the time.
We helped him financially.
You're obnoxious.
She declined the invitation.
I banged my leg on the coffee table.
We lost, but we had fun.
Many people put too much personal information on social media.
This is one of the best restaurants in town.
Did you come here alone?
What is the emergency?
There were no other survivors.
It just came out.
You really should eat before you leave.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
I told you I didn't want any coffee.
Are you afraid of the dark?
We ran a hundred-meter dash.
I still can't remember what Tom told me to do.
You're conscientious.
Any time will do so long as it is after six.
We all sang in unison.
I get up at six almost every day.
I couldn't tell you why.
She told him not to worry.
Tom checked the date.
If only I'd been a little more careful!
The baby is crawling.
Your voice sounds very familiar to me.
I have a lot of money in my savings account.
He will soon get used to the climate here.
It doesn't matter whether he comes late or not.
But I was careful.
I'm not thinking clearly.
I'd better get back home.
I think you're going to want to sit down.
I know you've got more important things to think about.
I owe my success to you.
Tom's bedroom door was closed.
He flatly refused to let me in.
He missed the train by one minute.
The walls were painted light brown.
That cost a lot of money.
I think we can handle this.
My coworker really knows how to suck up to the boss.
I like it.
The royal palace was built on a hill.
How very curious!
Although I was exhausted, I continued to work.
He decided not to go.
I wasn't expecting you to be here today.
I went to bed a little later than usual.
You have a strange sense of humor.
Did I give you enough time?
For some reason, people have been avoiding me like the plague ever since I got back from India.
Is the university's library open now?
The buildings look so tiny.
Do you know who that person is?
She is not always happy.
Speak quietly.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
He's mad at his daughter.
They defused the bomb before it could blow up.
They died in battle.
No more than 50 people came.
I have lived here for ten years.
Will it fit?
Let's sit down on that bench.
I don't know how to express my thanks.
Don't beat yourself up.
I swim in the summer.
You're back again.
There were many things that needed to be done before we could leave.
Tom disguised himself as a priest.
She had no brother.
Aren't you going to say something?
I was more than a little shocked by this.
Money is welcome everywhere.
You are right in a way.
I have to warn him.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
The dogs barked all night.
He has a lot more money than I have.
She got married at the age of seventeen.
I had to crawl under the fence.
I want you to understand this isn't going to be easy.
Why would you want to do that?
I've changed my daily routine.
I have nothing further to say.
I relied on his kindness.
You are holding my hand in that picture.
I had to help with the housework.
Let me check your ticket.
It looks like we fell into a trap.
Tell me when you will call me.
By then, however, it was too late.
She lived up to our expectations.
The wedding ceremony was performed in the morning.
You must be worn out after working all day.
The apple is red.
It was because of the storm that the trains were halted.
There are two zeros in the number "2010."
Tom wanted to tell the truth.
A soldier often has to confront danger.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
Look around.
I think I should do it for you.
You have to pay in advance.
The cause of the fire is not known.
This is how I made it.
He's reading a novel right now.
Are you doctors?
Could you remind me to call my academic advisor at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow?
I've had a slight sore throat since this morning. I wonder if I've caught a cold.
Do you need the keys?
Try another door.
The food is terrible.
Tom climbed into his truck.
Call if you need me.
They say that eating more slowly is one way to eat less.
We only see each other on weekends.
They released the prisoner.
I can wait.
I know that you have issues with your mom.
Not everyone agrees with that.
I don't have many friends.
He's from Georgia.
It's not our anniversary.
It'll happen.
I would've liked to stay longer.
I'd like you to have a blood test.
This word is derived from Latin.
I had to run to catch the bus.
A crowd soon gathered around him.
Teachers should never make fun of students who make mistakes.
They crossed the border.
I am afraid it will rain in the afternoon.
Fill in the blanks.
He has a few friends in this town.
Try to see things as they are.
He can play the piano, the flute, the guitar, and so on.
It was only a joke.
I wouldn't care.
We all escaped without injury.
They're both in love with the same guy.
Did you have a good sleep?
She is nothing but a child.
I recommend a thorough checkup for your husband.
Tom knows he's right.
What will you make?
Where have you been all this time?
There is an urgent need for social change.
Let me save you some trouble.
He's raking it in.
We're special.
She doesn't like the way I speak.
I really admire Tom.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I was scolded by my teacher.
He has never hurt anyone.
Tom was arrested last year.
What do you think I did?
He sat down by my side.
I'm smarter than you.
That flower has a strong smell.
He compared his car to the new model.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
He also speaks French.
Switzerland is a neutral country.
My wallet and passport are missing.
I know I've said some pretty stupid things today.
Tom came here to study French.
He knows how to milk a cow.
You can't just come here without an appointment.
Is Tom one of your friends?
Have you seen enough?
You're annoying.
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
You were so strong.
Can you close the door?
Why are you sitting there?
The previous tenant took excellent care of her apartment.
Let's spend less time arguing and more time working.
I don't particularly want to do that.
Tom was in trouble financially.
You can't go yet.
That's exactly what I needed.
Show me another watch.
That's my cat.
Where are you hurt?
I'm just lazy.
He works as a busboy.
I found that restaurant by accident.
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
I can't believe you fell for that.
He kept silent all day.
I think we'd better get out of here.
Better to err on the side of caution.
This is a very good tea.
December is the last month of the year.
We haven't been paid for three months.
I don't like you anymore.
She lost what little money she had.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
She trusted you.
He did it again.
I'm sure that he went to Tokyo.
Did they live here?
He has bought a lot in the suburbs with a view to building a house.
He stopped to smoke.
He could swim across the river when he was in his teens.
It never occurred to me to take a picture of how the garden looked before we started pulling weeds.
They sailed along the west coast of Africa.
He uncorked the bottle.
I am like my mother.
I have to change.
When did you start dating?
She spends a lot of time helping her children learn to deal with money.
It is difficult to speak three languages.
I come from a humble background.
She says she has no intention of having a baby until she's in her thirties.
We heard the door shut.
He hates carrots.
We helped them out when we could.
Why don't you help?
I'm glad Tom was there with me.
You need to move on.
What don't you have?
I want you to call off the fight.
You promised me that you would take care of them.
You must be exhausted.
Why are you asking so many questions?
That's the best I can do.
She says that she likes flowers.
He had no coat on.
He thought of a good idea.
I prefer soccer to baseball.
I found a rare book I had been looking for.
What a pretty girl!
Did you read it at all?
I'm feeling kind of tired.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
He pretended not to be hurt.
A priest was called in to give last rites to the dying man.
There's not enough food for all of us.
He never breaks his promises.
I've asked you repeatedly not to do that.
The boy is afraid of the dark.
Nearly all Japanese have dark hair.
Does this look familiar to you?
Tom got kicked by a horse.
I thought you might be lonely, so I came over with a bottle of wine.
Tom is persuaded he's right.
That is very expensive!
Ah! Everything is clear now.
Who's your girlfriend?
I have a horse.
I didn't ask for this.
You can't believe everything you hear.
How are you connected?
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I bought two loaves of bread.
He has no conscience.
I don't date.
Too much drinking will make you sick.
They have had no rain in Africa for more than a month.
The students burned their textbooks.
The mere sight of the doctor made my cousin afraid.
Don't put the glass near the edge of the table.
I like French cooking.
I think you'll have very little difficulty in getting a driver's license.
I only quit because you asked me to.
I didn't know that she had a child.
The roads were empty.
I had never seen a panda till that time.
Tom had jeans on.
Why do you think he said so?
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
The mere thought of it is enough to make me happy.
I got my hair cut today.
You have only to give him a little help.
I appreciate the invitation.
How come you know English so well?
You may go anywhere you like.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
You should get rid of these weeds.
Health is above wealth.
I thought you'd be much fatter.
You've been suspended.
Boy was I naive.
Tom told me you needed some money.
I need some cash.
I need the money.
Is anything the matter?
He asked for a beer.
I'm not certain.
I'm a beginner, too.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Pinocchio had a long nose.
Do you know how to program?
Do you know how to use this machine?
There was a car accident near here, wasn't there?
She's drop-dead gorgeous.
If you want any help, just call me.
I can't believe you turned down that job.
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.
Tom knocked on Mary's bedroom window.
I admire your talent.
The skyscraper was built on a solid foundation.
I suppose I'll have to be more careful in the future.
Don't you want to be in love again?
I won't say anything.
Do you like to dance?
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
Why don't you take a break?
I didn't know you had a cat.
They showed it to our company.
Get dressed quickly.
I want you to sing.
She gave in to the temptation.
You're grumpy.
Tom found evidence.
Who helps her?
Give me something to write on.
I will always be with you.
Can I tell you something very personal?
The population of Tokyo is greater than that of London.
I had to get out of the house.
We're listening.
These facts support my hypothesis.
You knew, didn't you?
The apples that he sent to me were delicious.
I don't know how long we've got.
They met for the first time in London.
I forgot all about it.
I am engaged in AIDS research.
He is a lazy student.
There was a sign saying, "Keep off the grass."
You don't deserve to live.
I captured butterflies with a net.
Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
I'm sure of it.
It serves you right.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
You're unambitious.
Where did you hide the food?
Are there still some empty seats?
The noise kept me awake all night.
I'm your partner.
We enjoyed skating.
I just don't care anymore.
Are you sure this is the right train?
Children often try to imitate their elders.
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
I just think we need to be extra careful.
When did you quit smoking?
We're better off without you.
My friends celebrated my birthday.
I figured you weren't coming.
I heard voices.
That idea is ridiculous.
You had better put on a raincoat.
We did have fun together, didn't we?
They married when they were young.
She lost her only son in the traffic accident.
He severely criticized the mayor.
But I was careful.
Don't yell at me.
I can't feel it.
She grew up to be a famous doctor.
Have you finished talking?
I'm really glad to hear that.
We're not perfect.
Tom hid under the table.
She drives very fast.
Tom handed Mary a bottle of water.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
Does the story have a happy ending?
He is busy learning English.
You should have seen it!
I feel like this isn't going to end well.
They spoke briefly.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
You are not a doctor.
You should see Tom's picture.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
This file is encrypted.
What direction does your house face?
The rain turned into snow.
He is living apart from his wife.
All my friends turned their back on me.
He came to Tokyo in search of employment.
Rest in peace.
I want this to be yours.
I just had my final exam today.
Please take me to this address.
She bought a new house the other day.
What makes you so sure that this won't happen again?
He called her bad names.
She gathered her children about her.
You can type, can't you?
Which reminds me, it's been more than 30 years since that incident.
I don't remember what happened anymore.
I don't want to play anymore.
This is no one's fault.
I moved to England from Germany when I was nine.
Someone has stolen all my money.
You've misunderstood.
He is in business.
Mom set the table.
I don't mind.
Is the Orient too foreign for you?
Tom announced his decision Monday.
Don't you want to sit in the front, Tom?
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
Are you flirting with him?
Are you sure he can do this?
Her birthday party will be held tomorrow evening.
I know you've got more important things to think about.
You are in over your head.
I'm as shocked as you are.
He asked me what I needed.
If it had not been for your raincoat, I would have been drenched to the skin.
We're not welcome.
You'd better not go today.
Close your eyes.
I'd like you to have this.
They can't all be full.
She was indignant at the way she had been treated.
We decorated the room ourselves.
He sang some old songs.
His story was made up.
This is the house I lived in when I was young.
Your question is hard to answer.
I know exactly what I'm asking.
You can read this book.
That is not my line.
He's in good physical condition.
Tom drinks at least three liters of water every day.
He lives all alone in the woods.
Have you memorized his number?
This shirt is too small for me to wear.
He looks like a monkey.
I think your answer is correct.
I'll call you later.
He caught hold of the rope.
The children made a giant snowman.
I think you look hot.
Tom hid under the table.
We don't need you.
How stupid of me!
I haven't had time to thank you properly.
He drives a Ferrari.
Let's talk shop for a while.
I always wanted to be different.
I don't know anything yet.
He adhered to his own theory.
He's better at it than I am.
I don't want you to be upset.
Which one will you choose?
She's taller than him.
Does he speak English?
They're not coming back.
Poaching is illegal.
I don't know if I can do this.
What's your schedule like today?
Tom pulled the fire alarm.
I lost three kilograms.
I parked around back.
The boys are thirsty.
I've only just come back.
I am seeing Mary this afternoon.
Ever since he arrived, everything has changed.
He often goes to the library by car.
I had something else in mind.
Are you here voluntarily?
Does the applicant have suitable abilities to carry out the job?
He came home at almost midnight.
Did you do what I asked?
How much is it?
She works hard.
Every seat was full.
Recently, there have been signs that the economy is picking up steam.
He filled the bucket with water.
He appeared thinner every day.
Natto is sticky.
You're very angry.
What're you all dressed up for?
"Are you sad?" "No. Why would I be?"
Like I said, I was busy.
He believes that he is a hero.
What woke you up?
I thought you'd never ask.
I asked what he was going to do.
Put the coat on the hanger.
The air conditioner is out of order.
I don't think about you in that way.
You don't have to come.
Let me see what it looks like.
He averted his gaze.
I apologize if I offended you.
In Kyoto, you can see both old and modern buildings.
I think we need more ice.
Start reading where you left off.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
I have some cash stashed away.
I can recommend it to anyone.
I don't like homework.
Even without makeup, she's very cute.
My left arm is asleep.
I don't know if I can stay.
What is it you want to talk about?
Where is the bathroom?
Is it true that you gamble?
Thank you very much for all you have done.
I think the police should enforce the laws that are on the books.
I study French.
I don't want you to think I'm nuts.
Tom stayed calm.
You are important.
I've never voted.
I love this show.
Tom spent the night in the small cabin near the lake.
What is it?
Is this your bicycle?
Does she have a big nose?
Nobody listened to me.
It's not easy for me to travel alone in Japan.
Our inventory is very limited.
He looks young.
You made a fool of yourself.
They belong to the chess club.
What made you so angry?
Can you still remember when we first met?
We know all this.
I love the people in this town.
You should keep your promises.
The bank is closed on Sunday.
I got expelled.
I'm counting on you.
I'd like to ask you a favor.
I can't believe that you really sold that junk for such a high price.
I can't express myself in English very well.
Tom doesn't have to come tomorrow.
You won't have a choice.
Pick a date.
Call the cops.
Who do you trust?
Tom sounds angry.
I know that I haven't been a very good father.
I couldn't help laughing when I heard that story.
She has a good figure.
Tom is an amateur photographer.
We have other important issues to discuss.
I think it's time for me to retire.
The bus was two minutes early.
She's waiting for you at home.
He is a complete idiot.
Are you ready now?
I was profoundly disturbed by this news.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You make it look easy.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
I'm washing my hands because they're dirty.
Get away from there.
He patted me on the shoulder.
He earns twenty dollars a day.
Could you please fix this?
Do they know that we know?
They stayed friends.
He went into teaching.
I wonder why some people think black cats are unlucky.
Anything you say can be used against you.
We're very grateful for your hospitality.
We had snow this morning.
The engine died.
This room is for rent.
There is a cookie under the table.
I was impressed.
I heard the message.
He is still grappling with religious beliefs.
I'd like to stand.
Tom speaks five languages, including Russian.
The policeman grabbed the robber's arm.
You're avoiding me.
My father complained about the traffic noise.
He went to the airport to see her off.
We're all devastated.
Today is Sunday.
What woke you up?
Tom knew nothing about Mary.
How many sisters do you have?
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
She visits him quite often, but never stays very long.
Nobody knows how I feel.
Tom has a very stressful job.
I don't like meeting new people.
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter.
I can't let you go.
The rent is very high.
How good is he?
I don't know if I have enough time.
If I were caught, do you know what would happen?
Please get in.
You look a little shaken.
He was absent from school because he was sick.
Louis Pasteur discovered that germs cause most infectious diseases.
I'll call back as soon as I can.
Students should make use of the books in the library.
We're not done yet.
I feel terrible about the way things happened.
Pray for all of us.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
A good night's sleep will do you a world of good.
Your car is fast.
Without your help, I would fail.
They were swimming.
Who knows that?
Our team did not reach the playoffs this year.
It's easily done.
This one is similar to that one.
Koalas are more popular than kangaroos.
How do you assess your students?
Open your eyes.
This machine was manufactured in France.
We need to do this right.
We must intervene.
He suggested that I write to her at once.
Your shirt button is coming off.
This vending machine is out of order.
That isn't enough.
I didn't sleep much last night.
It's not funny.
I'm at an office party.
I am sure that he will become a great singer.
This pen doesn't write well.
The students burned their textbooks.
At first, I didn't know what to do.
She took care of his wound.
Mary is young and attractive.
I can see myself in the mirror.
He has little money.
I think they like me.
They crossed the border.
I didn't know where else to go.
Like I said, no problem.
You should listen to your wife.
It is high time you started a new business.
"Is it going to clear up?" "I hope so."
Let me know as soon as you know.
We debated on the question of world population.
Tom asked Mary who she was looking for.
You must control yourself.
Does it bother you if I smoke?
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Who was the first person to break the four-minute mile?
Maybe I deserve this.
We can't keep doing this.
Ask him his name.
Please step back and keep behind the line.

There's a fine line between assertiveness and aggression.
I have a delivery for you.
I'm as tall as he is.
The thief was marched off to the police station.
Are they going to arrest Tom?
I just think we need to be extra careful.
Can he do it?
I have connections in the government.
No one's prepared.
Everyone, say cheese.
He could not hold back his tears.
Look up the number in the telephone book.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
That question is under discussion.
Are you in trouble with the law?
I don't like her hat.
Can you speak French well?
She set up an association to help blind people.
I decorated my room.
That's enough for me.
We have a plan.
The door opens into the bedroom.
You've been infected.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we had asked him to do.
He remained silent.
He promptly coped with the situation.
The event is still fresh in our memory.
I felt isolated.
You're very intelligent.
You could count to ten when you were two years old.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I guess I haven't made myself clear.
Suddenly it began to rain.
I am a stranger here.
Gasoline is no longer a cheap fuel.
We hope to come up with a solution soon.
It's raining again.
I liked walking alone on the deserted beach.
I know that this is important for us all.
The politician was thought to be telling the truth.
Tom is reading in his bedroom.
It really bugged me.

What wonderful weather!

I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
A slightly lower interest rate could save thousands of dollars over the life of a home loan.
I didn't say I liked it.
This may not be possible.
I haven't talked to Tom.
He tried hard, but failed.
Truer words were never spoken.
Ask only questions that can be answered with yes or no.
Help me out here.
Tom has to speak French every day at work.
I'm spontaneous.
He soon betrayed his ignorance.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Here is your bag.
Are you afraid of dogs?
So, do you really want to do this?
I didn't like it.
I want the absolute truth.
You have such a beautiful name.
We have to do the work in one day.
It's a present for you.
That market has been rapidly expanding.

I'd like you to look at something.
Hurry up, or we'll be late.
Theory and practice do not necessarily go together.
Don't look at me.
You ought to ask for your teacher's permission.
Someone left the water running.
Who are you to judge?
Did you take him back to your apartment?
Tom watches TV all the time.
I don't really know what this means.
Could you charge it to my room?
Cook for me.
I just can't get it right.
We're just about finished with this job.
We're smarter than that.
There's no mistake about it.
I opened an account at a nearby bank.
I was quite shocked by this.
We have to warn him.
This should solve all your problems.
She seems to be living by the lake.
Let's go out and have a good time with our friends.
I worked hard all day, so I was very tired.
He's tickled pink.
Does Mary want me to walk her home?
All the food was gone.
The policeman is wearing a gas mask.
Is there an information counter?
There is no hope.
As soon as he went to bed, he fell asleep.
We're almost there.
We're not fit.
I thought my parents would be proud of me.
Have you had lunch?
Are you happy now?
I think that he's a good teacher.
They were enjoying themselves.
I stopped laughing.
I don't have any close friends.
Are you listening?
Stand back!
Don't be late to school again.
I'm used to cooking for myself.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Who baked this cake?
Show me the photos, please.
I know we're a pretty good team.
He had no money.
He carved me a wooden doll.
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
Have you made your decision yet?
The price of gas is rising.
We aren't married.
See to it that all the doors are locked before you go out.
I didn't volunteer.
He has a tendency to be pessimistic.
Have it your own way.
We're like brothers.
He's deep in debt.
Did you have fun last night?
You are a teacher.
Milk boils at a higher temperature than water.
I read comic books.
I gather you were hurt.
He has a point.
This place was bombed during the war.
It could just be your imagination.
No less than three hundred dollars was needed for the work.
They walked upstairs.
Are you mentally challenged?
I was born in America.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
I'm sure you have other skills.
He may be clever, but he is not very helpful.
That computer might not work.
People can't live without air.
If it rains tomorrow, I'm not going to the meeting.
The game would not have been called off if it hadn't rained so heavily.
All of us went to the theater to see a play.
I don't want to give up.
The door handle is broken.
What do you say to a game of chess?
I'm worried about you.
It looks like your dog is thirsty.
When did you start writing songs?
We're broke.
This is the best restaurant I know of.
I need you here.
People used to laugh at him behind his back.
Sometimes I get carried away.
He is good at soccer.
You should've said so earlier.
I think I'm ready to leave.
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy.
His brother was lost in the town.
Use them all.
I planned to introduce him to her.
I don't want to discourage you from doing that.
The castle might be haunted.
She is absorbed in her study.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
I will find you a good doctor.
I can't find my key.
I had hardly left home when it began to rain heavily.
You can't do it, can you?
Are you with the FBI?
It shouldn't be like that.
The game was very exciting.
What will you do?
Catch the ball.
You're very sophisticated.
We'll have to make some tough choices.
You can't just leave your car parked in front of the fire hydrant.
He asked me if I could do him a favor.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
Tom put the plate of sandwiches on the table in front of Mary.
I can see it in your eyes.
My mother made me a bag.
Write me.
That cost him his job.
He came downstairs.
I've forgotten about her.
I arrived here about five o'clock.
We liked the food, especially the fish.
It was a very exciting game.
She patiently waited for him.
Tom described the incident in detail.
They believe in God.
It was worth trying.
Do you think you'll be here tomorrow?
I need a clean shirt.
The weather turned bad.
Is there something you haven't told me?
She talked him into going to the concert.
He took credit for my idea.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
Are you suggesting that it's beyond my comprehension?
It was a pretty amazing experience.
Don't make promises that you cannot keep.
If you tell too many lies, people won't ever believe you.
Did I blow it?
I have absolute confidence in your judgement.
The nation ceased to exist.
You must be very special.
I spoke to Tom about what Mary did.
She wanted to live a more relaxing life.
Let me help.
Don't just stand there, say something.
I think we can handle that.
He's broke.
Do you know anything?
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
I'm in way over my head.
My idea is different from yours.
They're going to try.
I hope to marry her.
You should've told Tom that a long time ago.
I am saving money in order to buy a new personal computer.
Is there any chance that you have eaten any of the contaminated food?
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Do I have a choice?
You're not safe here.
I need to borrow your car.
You're the prettiest woman I've ever seen.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
I thought nothing of it.
Are you falling for me?
What's standing between us and that happening?
Eat more fruit.
I suppose you've already bought a ticket.
Form two lines.
She cleared the dishes from the table after dinner.
You look busy.
I have to reduce my expenses this month.
He took a walk before breakfast.
Nobody is too old to learn.
Please keep me updated.
I think we lost Tom.
In other words, he is lazy.
No matter where you may go, don't forget to write to me.
I didn't know who he was.
Wait just a moment.
Have you ever been to Africa?
My daughter has braces.
Are you still sleepy?
Don't close the door.
I should have talked to you first about it.
She has a new man in her life.
Where can I pick up my airplane ticket?
My hair is getting long.
What's wrong with being naked?
Yesterday I stumbled across a copy of my father's family register.
We're getting nowhere with those problems.
I still need to use these things, so please don't take them away.
Please write back soon.
I want to talk to you alone.
I asked Tom why he was unhappy.
He kicked him while he was down.
She plays the piano by ear.
I'm the one who picked those flowers.
Do I look like a plumber?
Let's not squabble.
Your parents were right.
Tom seems dangerous.
You are tired, and so am I.
I think we're out of gas.
I want to have my own room.
I considered not going.
He died before the ambulance arrived.
Which is the best?
How do you intend to fix this?
We did our best to help him, but he didn't so much as say thank you.
Go and see who it is.
This room is comfortable.
What an interesting book!
Leave me alone.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
Can I ask you something personal?
What time are you going on duty?
He walked along the river.
A good book is a great companion.
I found this column interesting.
I really like him!
I knew the risk.
There's nothing worse than that.
What're you doing?
He never lies.
Don't you know that he passed away two years ago?
Could I see the menu and wine list?
What prevented you from coming earlier?
I like picnics.
What more do we need to make us happy?
He became irritated.
She translated it word for word.
The pay is meager.
I feel like an impostor.
Things are looking good.
I'm sure Tom had a good reason.
Put your hands up in the air!
Please choose wisely.
They handled it well.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
Keep your gun handy.
I really like it, too.
I really like being with you.
Did you crash your car into something?
I can't really remember.
What was that sound?
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
I dropped my earring.
I hope you're well.
Tom came half an hour late.
I just couldn't say no.
I work with him.
You had better start at once.
This material stretches easily.
We were under constant surveillance.
I just got tenure.
I did it already.
Can I have my bicycle back?
You are the one.
I know how hard it's been.
I will get him to come and help me.
It may be the last time.
I'm all for that.
Tom can count on Mary.
Does she have a boyfriend?
Do you play any instruments?
I bought this yesterday.
It couldn't have come at a better time.
I'm still not sure I can do that.
I'm immune.
You made a great contribution.
How much did the tickets cost you?
He crossed the street.
Tom was like a brother to me.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
He's on his last legs.
He's not good at remembering names.
Japan is weird.
I asked him if I could read his book.
The voice actors did a excellent job on this movie.
I'll quit.
Our firm is on the verge of bankruptcy, I'm ashamed to say.
Why did you want to come back here?
It seems that I have lost my keys.
You look gorgeous in that dress.
Teach me how you do it.
I saw him sawing a tree.
We should all stick together.
She took him to the lake.
I'm dehydrated.
I don't like who you've become.
I'd like to cancel my reservation.
I have enough money to buy it.
Go and wake Tom up.
Are you ready?
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
I can't believe everything Tom says.
Let me know the result as soon as you can.
You're never too old to learn.
I wanted the best.
Did you think of that?
I'm just lazy.
That's our best hope.
Tom is a high school principal.
I can easily convince you of his innocence.
We become very shorthanded at the end of the year.
I bought a newspaper written in English.
The bicycle is mine.
I just got a call from your school.
How do you tell each other apart?
I thought you were working.
Taste buds are needed to taste food.
You did well, Tom.
Is it nearby?
Ask me again some other time.
Having nothing to do, he went downtown.
How could we not win?
You don't seem so smart.
This game is so hard.
You have no fever.
Could you do me a small service?
Tom's afraid.
Tom ran out of the room.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
The room smelled of tobacco.
I have been in Japan for three years.
Why don't you help us?
You're winning, aren't you?
I think there are lots of sites to see here.
Are you through with your work?
He is riding a bicycle.
He examined the spare parts one after another.
I said nothing about the matter.
Have pity on us!
She likes all of us.
He pretends to be deaf.
He often makes people angry.
She has nothing in common with him.
What was he doing there?
He's a freelance journalist.
He didn't get paid for it.
There was something moving in the distance.
I don't want to shoot you.
A group of young men were fighting.
I don't know which of you is older.
I love puzzles.
We spoke briefly.
I like all of them.
Please call me a doctor.
You broke your leg.
My father has a lot of books.
Tom died when he was 97.
Tom asked me to be here.
May I introduce myself?
I think you're ready.
Your question is hard for me to answer.
Don't come so early next time.
Don't look at him!
I haven't done this in a while.
You'll never be alone.
Are you really going to let Tom do that?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
The patient fainted at the sight of blood.
Why do you ignore me?
It's really fun.
My father is proud of the fact that he's never been in a traffic accident.
I don't want to see anybody today.
A girl came running, with her hair streaming in the wind.
I'm not the manager.
I had to wait twenty minutes for the next bus.
She can't have said so.
Do your homework right away.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
He threw me the apple.
You should have seen me.
It's yours.
Did you come here alone?
Tom is in the park.
Tom doesn't need to wait any longer.
You made me lose my mind.
She is very proud of her daughter.
Take a short cut.
We can't save everyone.
I'd like to graduate next spring.
Who is the tall guy with long dark hair playing the guitar?
I finally gave up.
You're talkative.
It's the best we have.
If you want to be free, destroy your television set.
That's more than I expected.
A marathon is pretty exhausting.
Tom really hates this kind of thing.
Don't worry. I've already taken care of it.
Tom fired his secretary.
They'll kill you.
I can handle this.
A frog in a well doesn't know the ocean.
I want to be here with you.
Is the water deep?
He is not much better, and there is a little hope of recovery.
Taking off is easier than landing.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
Tom didn't have dinner last night.
All of the milk was spilled.
What's she doing?
Go home now.
That would be all right.
We don't like the rain.
Why do you think so?
I forgot my briefcase.
Every day I either ride a bike or get the bus to work.
What should I name it?
You didn't have any choice.
We have to sing at an old folks home today.
We're being attacked.
The boy gathered a handful of peanuts and put them in a small box.
I made brownies.
I have to take some photos for my class project.
Classes start at eight in the morning.
Be proud of yourself.
Tom bought a used car.
I went to bed after eating.
If my brother were here, he would know what to do.
I like summer holidays better than school.
Waste not, want not.
They revolted against the government.
Answer my question.
You think I did it, don't you?
We've got a boat.
What is the tallest mountain in Europe?
Several students came to the library.
I think we ought to change our policy.
That was just icing on the cake.
I want to teach history when I grow up.
I found out whose car went off the road.
Please don't hurt me.
You touched my heart.
You really do speak English quite well.
Where can I rent a costume?
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
Somebody must break the sad news to her mother.
I count on your help.
Call me.
How did you and Tom first meet?
The Olympic Games are held every four years.
I've got real feelings for you.
It has no bearing on this problem.
I do what is required.
What do you need?
I can't express my feelings.
Do you have any kids?
Do you have guests for dinner?
I'm smarter than you.
He took me by the hand.
People should be the masters of their own destinies.
We weren't able to do that.
Both of his parents are well.
I don't love her.
You're finicky.
I know nothing yet.
She smells bad.
I appreciate you coming here.
The weather report said that it'll rain this afternoon, but I don't think it will.
Have you ever been run over?
I thought we had more time.
I don't feel very well.
Zap it in the microwave for thirty seconds.
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
I never told you to quit.
Come downtown with us.
Isn't that irritating?
I did something stupid.
Do you know how to speak English?
I am diabetic.
Ask me anything you like.
Are you seeing anybody now?
Walls have ears.
We played a lot of games at the party.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
It's only ten minutes' walk from here.
We agreed among ourselves.
Do you eat spaghetti by twirling it around your fork?
You're finicky.
I want you to dance with me.
I had a weird dream last night.
It's time for you to get up.
None of your business.
I feel comfortable.
Tom turned on the light.
I reviewed the file.
He's a bigot.
You've been injured before, haven't you?
I didn't need your help.
It's a little dated.
Don't play with fire.
Go straight down the road, and when you pass the traffic light you're there.
Is it true that you were on TV yesterday?
I thought you did fairly well.
I never thought Tom would hit Mary.
Stop being cruel.
You're the reason I came.
As more paper money came into use, the value fell.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
This mall is so big that I can't find the exit.
This is not a game.
You're silly.
Get me something to eat.
You don't need that.
We need a large amount of money for this project.
Where's the nearest restroom?
School begins at half past eight.
Why did you let me sleep so late?
As soon as I can afford to buy a house, I will.
Tom didn't do his homework.
Don't be so angry.
Could you please overlook it this time?
Her beauty is incomparable.
We didn't kiss.
We saw it on the news.
Tom is sitting in the conference room.
The boy made a paper plane.
I am going to see the dentist tomorrow.
I'm not at all tired.
We're separated.
Come in, the door's open.
They like ragtime, jazz and music with a swing to it.
All at once, he spoke out.
Stop bothering me!
I'd like to try out this new model before I buy it.
Photography is now considered a new form of art.
I see you've made a friend.
I'm attentive.
Whether we like it or not, we have to go there.
The baby is sleeping in the cradle.
What are you going to do with this money?
We've arrived.
Some continue to work part time, while others do volunteer work.
I helped them yesterday.
Young as he is, he has a large family to provide for.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you wouldn't be late today?
Written in easy English, this book is suitable for beginners.
Don't touch it.
Tom is a candidate.
What should we cook?
Don't lose heart.
We watched the soccer game on TV.
I'll shoot.
It's the biggest house in the neighborhood.
Can you wait a minute?
Tom tried to cheer Mary up.
This is the very best way to do it.
I refused to believe it.
Has Tom's dog ever bitten Mary?
That's what Tom wants to know.
That's my beer.
Please do not buy it.
You will need a bodyguard.
Are you being serious?
A minute has sixty seconds.
You'd better tell him the truth.
How can you not like him?
Thirteen passengers were hospitalized.
Don't you like us?
Tom didn't kill anyone.
Did Tom confess to killing Mary?
I know you haven't done it yet.
Tom felt someone touch his arm.
I was very tired.
When did this come about?
All you have to do is follow me.
He's a bit naive.
I have no money to buy the book with.
He danced all night long.
They look cool.
Are you married?
It's no use trying anything.
You should have spoken more politely.
Next time I switch jobs, I need work that will let me make use of the experience I've gained up to now.
The sun is rising.
The guards found a hacksaw blade in the prisoner's pocket.
I have no idea who that is either.
Someone tried to kill me.
I bought a VIP pass.
I'm going to a monster truck rally.
The international space station is an amazing feat of engineering.
Do you think there's a connection?
I'd like to be friends.
I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Fortunately, no passengers were injured.
What did she drink?
Tom usually wears white tennis shoes.
She is very fond of flowers.
Tom asked for a discount.
I lost my favorite pen.
In case of fire, dial 119.
I know I have a biased opinion.
What are you going to do during the summer holidays?
I'm being used.
Would you mind if I left early?
Disable the alarm.
I'll be working.
He entered junior high school.
How did you come up with that answer?
I'm going to need someone to help me.
And then, he chased the cattle, the sheep and everyone out of the temple.
The sky is becoming cloudy.
Just don't tell anyone, OK?
The crowd applauded.
My grandpa is out of step with the younger generation.
I'd like to remind you that you're under oath.
Do you really think it's impossible?
Maybe it's true.
That was mentioned.
His dress is that of gentleman, but his speech and behavior are those of a clown.
We ran into each other at the airport.
There's no escape.
I don't wear glasses anymore.
Didn't you feel like going?
You need to stop doing that right now.
She studies hard.
I think you've been fortunate.
What do you want for breakfast?
This is a violation of the law.
I take back what I said.
I'll give you a hand.
It's a miracle that you were able to survive.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
I can't afford to shop at such an expensive store.
I am staying with my uncle for the time being, but later I will move to a small apartment.
I really appreciated your help yesterday afternoon.
She introduced her sister to him.
Are you mentally ill?
He went to America to study medicine.
Tom didn't go to the dance.
Were you at home all morning?
I'm right beside you.
I eagerly await your decision.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
She got him to do everything she wanted him to do.
My birthday is coming up.
I was there.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
She'll spend the next four years in prison.
Don't cut your finger.
Could I have one more coffee, please?
I feel terrible about the way things happened.
I'll call you when I get there.
Your book is on the desk.
This bird cannot fly.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
I never see a library without wishing I had time to go there and stay till I had read everything in it.
Do you have children's clothes?
We were granted the privilege of fishing in this bay.
Don't change a thing.
It won't be long before he is up and about.
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
I don't want to talk about this now.
Let's sing a happy song.
Follow us. We're headed to the nearest bar.
She rejected my proposal.
He sold his business and retired.
She asked me what had become of him.
I will make her happy.
Her home is in the suburbs.
Tom isn't really my type.
I'll tell Tom to stay outside.
I want you out of my office.
I didn't mean to surprise you.
You came at just the right time.
Tom doesn't think it'll rain, but he plans to carry an umbrella just in case.
Casualties were inevitable.
I think you're going to make it.
Are you sure you're up for it?
I never wanted this.
I appreciate your support.
They invited them to dinner.
He wants to be an engineer.
He will become a good doctor.
There is no way of reaching the island other than by boat.
I did not order this.
Who let the dogs out?
Is that what you think I want to hear?
A new building is being built in front of my house.
The drunken men made derogatory remarks toward the women in the club.
You're the oldest.
Would you work for minimum wage?
I had no idea what to expect.
They gave up.
She waved at me before she got on board the plane.
I want a new kitchen.
I spoke with the minister myself.
I disagree with you on the matter.
I think it won't rain tomorrow.
You like everyone.
How is the weather today?
Are all the passengers aboard?
You can't kill someone that's already dead.
The food was not fit for man or beast.
I have three times as many books as he does.
How old is this TV?
Tell me when to stop.
Have you been here all day?
I am going to America by plane.
When will we go home?
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
This company has been spying on its employees.
His room is anything but neat.
All I want is your cat.
You're very timid.
It's technically illegal.
I bet you didn't know that.
Can you hear us?
Pork doesn't agree with me.
Tom had no way of verifying the information.
You're the one who decided to do this job, right?
You had better ask him which way to take.
I'm glad I invited you.
I'm happy you're here.
Just follow them.
Well, that's upsetting.
You're beautiful.
Live free or die.
You're not my friend.
I have an account at that book shop.
The road was blocked by fallen rocks.
What's going to happen to your prisoners?
How did you end up being Tom's manager?
I have an important meeting.
I knew you'd come back for me.
I want to know where they hid the money.
It's strange that our friends are not here.
I like your city.
I can't come with you.
I was very rich until I met her.
A leading specialist was brought in to authenticate the painting.
The old man looked wise.
She spends over a third of her time doing paperwork.
He is an experienced teacher.
She nuzzled up against her boyfriend.
His project ended in failure.
She advised him not to buy a used car.
My brother has become a priest.
We were both drunk.
I don't want that kind of responsibility.
My father likes strong coffee.
Do you want to know where you made your mistake?
She glanced shyly at the young man.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
I want to know everything you know.
I asked who he was.
I know that Japanese songs are very difficult for us.
The robber aimed his gun at the police officer.
How does he go to school?
Education does not consist simply in learning a lot of facts.
Don't you think we'd better stay here?
She lived next door to us.
I hated history class.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I remember when it happened.
We waited up for him until two o'clock and then finally went to bed.
I did all the work myself.
You have to accept your role.
I can't describe how I felt.
Do you understand French?
Ten years have passed since he died.
She has a bad habit of talking a long time on the phone.
This is unbearable.
It was fun playing in the park.
Settlers were forced off their land.
The traffic was bad.
She took part in the contest.
That's when I decided to quit talking.
They called him a coward.
He doesn't like to wait until the last moment to do something.
There was no warning whatsoever.
Don't say a word to anyone.
Maybe you'd like to come with us.
I brought a book.
I'll bring the glasses.
A number of passengers were injured.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I had already left when they arrived.
This is my dictionary.
She's a very nice girl.
My house faces to the south.
I never learned his real name.
These flowers come from Holland.
We'll do away with all these silly rules as soon as we can.
He kept his word.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Be proud of yourself.
I like to be here.
All the seats are booked.
Maybe we can fix this.
It's missing.
You must do it quickly.
Tom wanted to dance with Mary.
He'll finish the job by tomorrow.
We're going now.
I saw her home.
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
You have to go to the party.
There is an urgent need for a new system.
I want the truth from you.
She's asking how that's possible.
I let them go.
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
If it snows tomorrow, I will build a snowman.
You've been there before, haven't you?
I apologized for having been late for school.
Don't stick your hand out of the window.
Tom visited Australia in 2013.
I have lived here a long time.
Do you know where Tokyo Tower is?
I don't know her.
I think Tom believed me.
I want to speak.
I thought you were bluffing.
The stable is right behind the farm house.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
You have to tell me the truth.
I remember seeing you last year.
It seems he's still alive.
You should be proud of yourselves.
I'm satisfied with my work.
What would cause that?
I know I'm going to regret this.
Aren't you a little cold?
I'll take anything.
What're you looking for?
She loves her children.
I would've waited.
Do you like summer?
The airplane was flying above the clouds.
Do you like writing?
She accused me of stealing her money.
Tom didn't tell Mary everything.
It is likely to be fine tomorrow.
Do I have to take this medicine?
I'll see to it first thing tomorrow.
The high court decided to try the fugitive warlord in abstentia.
What could they possibly want us to do?
Stir the soup.
They even named their boy after you.
They should have one.
I got rid of it.
I don't feel very happy.
They live apart.
They adapted themselves to the change quickly.
Why don't you ask when you have a problem?
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
English is a universal language and is used all over the world.
You look so handsome.
Keep it warm.
We can't do this without you.
She got wet to the skin.
Why did you help Tom escape?
It's something my mother used to do.
Although her house is nearby, I seldom see her.
Speak for yourself.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
Take a card.
His secretary seems to know the truth.
Tom didn't have the courage to disobey Mary.
I want your love.
You won't be disappointed.
She is practicing the violin now.
He is heroic.
I can't bear the thought of her with another man.
He returned home by way of Hong Kong.
They made her go.
The actress tore up her contract angrily.
Don't expose it to the rain.
You can't change people. They have to change themselves.
I want you to be safe.
We can't hang around here.
I felt my heart beating rapidly.
There's something not quite right.
She kissed me, not him.
Was that an insult?
If you go near a camel, you risk being bitten.
Tom looked at it more closely.
I think you did it.
How did you manage to do that?
Do you really want to know?
The poor are getting poorer.
I know that you don't like me.
A stream of people came out of the theater.
His words gave me hope.
I think he's going to be sick.
You were hungry, weren't you?
Five plus three is eight.
Did I give you enough time?
Changes came quickly.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I can't blame you.
I'm studying in the library.
Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.
I can reschedule.
Do I have to spell this out for you?
How're you doing?
Who hired you?
We have a holiday today.
Tom didn't expect Mary to react like she did.
Tom asked Mary why John was so unhappy.
What do you like to eat?
I like to travel alone.
This is a dead-end alley.
It's illegal to buy cocaine.
It would be counter-productive to do such a thing.
Tom left thirty minutes ago.
You're sloshed.
She doesn't have many friends.
Whoever told you that is a liar.
Tell me what I should be watching for.
Gum got stuck to the bottom of my shoe.
My wife is suffering from pneumonia.
Do you know where they come from?
I really wish I knew why Tom didn't like me.
You don't have to respond.
He's addicted.
Rice grows in warm climates.
Tom told me that he liked working with Mary.
Show me your hands.
What's that stuff?
Tom and Mary quickly became friends.
Have another drink.
You're always finding fault with me.
Maybe Tom's got something to hide.
If I had 25% more income, I'd be more satisfied with my life.
I have bad breath.
They have two daughters.
Nobody answered the phone.
I was afraid he might die.
The job is almost finished.
We're prejudiced.
Did I hurt your feelings?
I've rented a room in Paris for a month.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
I'm happy to see you here.
He owes me one.
Why do people dye their hair?
I was rereading the letters you sent to me.
You may injure yourself if you don't follow safety procedures.
I'm a farmer.
Maybe you should turn off the TV.
I appreciate it.
I want you out of here right now.
I had to crawl under the fence.
Did I give you that impression?
I carefully took down everything that my teacher said.
What does your son want to be when he grows up?
We made out like bandits.
All graduates are invited.
They are watching a movie.
The plane flew above the clouds.
I'm no longer hungry.
He meant no harm.
Tom can't swim as well as Mary can.
I've got them all.
I can't do what I'm being paid to do.
I really think you should leave.
He's too young to drink.
He will be having dinner with her at this time tomorrow.
When are you coming to the Netherlands?
He has come a long way.
The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know.
Did you see anyone?
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
Are you still jealous?
You can come.
I waited a month.
I'm not allowed to help you.
The insulin was making her fat.
I've just seen Tom.
She took the taxi to the museum.
It depends on the size of the chair.
Tom denied having met Mary.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
Tom and Mary have three daughters.
He has excellent reflexes.
They all joined in the chorus.
I don't think any more students want to come.
We want peace.
I'll never understand you.
Are you planning on staying in Boston for a long time?
According to today's paper, there was a big earthquake in Chile yesterday.
I'm sorry but I forgot to do the homework.
As a writer, she does not fit into any of the traditional categories.
Are you an exchange student?
You crossed the line.
A bill came along with the package.
I need the keys.
Did you have a nice evening?
I'd like to make some changes in the draft.
They danced until six in the morning.
The plot twists were predictable.
It's going to take me a while to get this done.
Don't be so outraged.
He won't leave us alone.
You're not safe here.
We'll check.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before leaving for America.
I saw the man jump.
Please do it quickly.
Why don't you sit down for a moment?
You said you didn't care.
I miss you already.
I left a note on your door this morning.
His temperature is normal.
You've set a bad example.
This is big.
I don't know what I'm going to do yet.
I'm being punished.
You had better have your eyes examined.
We offered him a nice job.
Is the job too much for you?
I knew we should've stayed in Boston.
I do hope you will come and visit us soon.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
I'd like you to meet my wife.
That was a lie.
Tom has a friend in Boston.
Tom is like that.
I don't understand it.
That school looks just like a prison.
Tom knows that won't work.
Tom heard some shots.
When we borrow money, we must agree on the conditions.
Do it again!
She asked him some questions, but he refused to answer.
Tom asked Mary some questions, but she refused to answer them.
I am looking at that.
He loves me for who I am.
Could you please tell me your height and weight?
Ask Tom where Mary is.
It's a very small price for such an important victory.
It's not possible to do two things at once.
You don't look well.
I understand your concern.
Where can I buy silk?
No one's looking.
They probably saw our ship come into port.
Tom told Mary to stop eating.
Tom looks happier today.
Could you give me a leg up here?
Whose clock is it?
He wore a mask so no one would recognize him.
It's simple and intuitive.
Are you through with the paper?
I write letters almost every day.
I can't decide what to eat for lunch today.
I don't go to school by bus.
Her desires were fully fullfilled.
That hadn't occurred to me.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
Doesn't anyone care?
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
He is not the shy boy he used to be.
I keep a rabbit as a pet.
Tom is a great actor.
Tom doesn't like to travel.
Why don't you try a different tack?
I lost sight of her in the crowd.
I hate to interrupt, but I need to say something.
I am lazy.
This plant grew little by little.
I hope you're well paid.
How was the universe created?
The supermarket is open.
Tom is writing a book.
This is the flag of Japan.
There's nothing that can stop us now.
Tell me you're kidding.
You know what you must do.
He is a scientist who is respected by everybody.
I'd better go, too.
Everything remains as it was.
I feel tired all the time.
My wife is a good manager.
Both of them are very cute.
How many days do you plan to stay?
This word is both a noun and a verb.

Tom is proud of his car.
He spoke well of her son.
You're safe.
I knew you would do something great.
The museum isn't open on Sundays.
He was disqualified from the competition.
I didn't say it wasn't OK to eat.
I'm free.
You must respect your elders.
Business is quite slow.
For the time being, he's staying at a neighboring hotel.
She advised him to use a bicycle.
It's not their fault.
Tom spoke into the microphone.
That's not wrong.
Be nicer to your brother.
There's a serious problem.
I prefer to work alone.
I don't really want to see you suffer.
No one answered my question.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
It was your idea.
Give me a little money.
Something is the matter with this TV set.
I sure am cold.
She wriggled her toes.
He was carrying an umbrella under his arm.
It's a matter of taste.
Does he have any brothers?
It was such a hard test that we did not have time to finish.
I'll do anything you ask.
Who takes care of you?
Are you crying?
What're you saying?
This could take a while.
What makes you think that isn't true?
I'm scared of heights.
Tom is studying in Boston.
Don't talk about my family.
Where was he headed?
They're not alone.
It's more fun than drinking coffee.
I just want to be a little happier.
People talk without having anything to say.
Everyone felt safe.
Do you have plans for dinner?
Washing your hands regularly is a good way to prevent catching some diseases.
Every successful writer has a drawer full of rejection letters.
How did you get caught?
Be careful with my luggage.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
I will do all I can for you.
Can I take pictures here?
He waited for the elevator to come down.
I want you all to myself.
On Mondays, he's always at home.
You're going to have to leave.
He made fun of my accent.
I'm doing this for you.
Even monkeys fall from trees.
I tricked you.
Do you see the entrance of the park?
Don't cut your finger.
I want you.
Stop screaming like a girl.
We're all bored.
Tom lowered his sword.
That is not my pen.
I think you know what you should do.
She goes jogging every morning before breakfast.
I didn't run away from home.
He's a smart little feller.
Tom's death has been officially ruled as an accident.
I didn't have enough time to eat everything that was served.
I've given this a lot of thought.
Tom suggested another plan to the committee.
I sure miss my friends.
What can be the meaning of this?
A dog suddenly jumped at me.
May I take a rest for a while?
What direction are you going?
Just because he likes painting doesn't mean he's good at painting.
Do you want to get out of here?
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
Give me a minute.
We're finally alone.
I'm sure that is the truth.
Why don't you quit?
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
I like what you did.
He told his wife not to buy on impulse.
Stop right there.
Will she come?
She couldn't take her eyes off him.
Stop worrying about it.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
Sorry, we are closed.
We often eat fish raw.
His recovery was nothing short of a miracle.
Tom has a big mouth.
Don't speak with your mouth full!
I don't want you to be upset.
Why don't you let us go with you?
Please translate this Japanese text into French.
That's not very good.
You remind me of my daughter.
Tom wants to forgive his father for abandoning him.
She waved both her hands so that he could find her.
Stop hitting the cat!
Are you referring to me?
I gave my sister a pearl necklace on her birthday.
She's a good liar.
I did what I was told.
She still has a little money, but not much.
She also speaks French.
Six months ago I had an operation for the cataract in my right eye.
My mother is knitting me a new sweater.
I plan to study this afternoon after I get home.
Did you find your keys?
I need to get out of here.
I believe love exists.
You're a terrible person.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
Tom started to take off his jacket.
Women don't drive as well as men.
Take off your clothes.
I've always liked antiques.
Why do you have your umbrella up? It's not raining.
I wonder why I'm so sleepy.
There are more clouds today than yesterday.
His story is well worth listening to.
He did it not for me but for himself.
Do you like robots?
I was stupid enough to believe it.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
Tom didn't seem very busy.
What do you think I did?
You shouldn't see her now.
He read the article over and over again.
I have a rough idea where it is.
That doesn't seem quite so important anymore.
You'll have to learn all these dates by rote.
I love watching you cook.
You should make sure of it before you go.
This is a little gift for you.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
I have good news in store for you.
Are they satisfied?
It's true that Americans love pizza.
You'd better hurry.
She devoted herself to her children.
I always counted you as a friend.
I'll play along.
I hope I can count on your discretion.
Tom says he saw nothing.
As soon as we find out anything, we will contact him.
That's a shame.
You should've called the cops.
Tom's new wife's name is Mary.
I have to run.
Do you want to do this?
I think Tom was born in Boston.
I don't feel like going out right now.
Would you be interested in having dinner with me?
Did you win?
You understand French, right?
We're surprised.
Only those who risk going too far will know how far one can go.
Do you have plans for this weekend?
You guys are a lot of fun.
She is interested in music.
I felt like an idiot.
If you wish, I'll ask.
How old was she when she got married?

I'm used to being ignored by my parents.
I don't care if you go or not. I'm going anyway.
Here is a list of things you should avoid eating.

I only wish I could return the favor.
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

It's probably just a phase.
I know something's wrong.
We baked it together.
How could you not know?
They ganged up on him.
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope.
They crashed.
How long have you waited?
Tom turned off the engine and shut off the headlights.
I don't have a white shirt.
What is the emergency?
His life was full of drama.
He rescued the child from the burning house.
I guess that would be all right.
Have you ever been lonely?
We must cut our expenses to save money.
Not all birds build nests.
A week has seven days.
You can only use it once.
Your telephone's ringing, Tom.
Keep the door closed.
I lay on my face.
I am undressing.

Just get off the stage.
You were sleeping, weren't you?
I didn't tell you everything.
I went aboard.
I've still got a lot to learn.
Tom called me almost every day while he was in Boston.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
I neither smoke nor drink.
I have faith in the future.
Are you going by bus or car?
I could say nothing in my dad's presence.
I thought I'd find you here.
You may stay here as long as you like.
I'll just wait.

Tom put on his coat and left.
Both brothers are still alive.
She is not afraid of anything.
It keeps getting harder and harder.
That's not exactly how it happened.
"Tom and Mary have broken up." "That's ancient history."
That's not for me to say.
I like bread.
I hope you are not catching a cold.
I've been busy.
The schedule dictates that this work be done by the weekend.
Can you tell me what this is?
They were even more interested in his beautiful wife.
I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Bring me a glass of water.
It cost less than fifteen dollars.

He exchanged his old car for a new one.
I like your hair.

You're very understanding.
I think you've done enough.
We need a firm quotation by Monday.
Please bring me a cup of tea.
I chose not to leave.
I was tired so I went to bed.
There isn't anyone in the room.
How long did you stay?
Where do you get off telling me that?
We are classmates.
I don't know who Tom gave that to.
The rise in house prices enabled him to sell his house at a big profit.
She made me a cake.
I'm too tired to argue.
Tom hasn't actually ever been to Boston.
He walked back and forth in the room.
Tom doesn't seem to get it.
Sometimes we lie to keep from hurting someone else's feelings.

I think we're all a bit cuckoo.
I'll go get the proper forms.
Keep on trying.
We're dancing.
He was kind enough to invite me.
I downloaded it.
Are you sure everything's OK?
I forgot my key.
Tom isn't happy at all.
Do you have dinner plans?
Tom's the kind of person who calls a spade a spade and a lot of people don't like that.
I don't find it that difficult.
I had a nagging sensation that I'd seen him somewhere before.
I'll come back for you.
What a beautiful night!
I had to take care of her baby.
You're assertive.
You're selfish.

I serve no one.
You had better ask the doctor for advice.
I'm letting you go.
He who knows the most often says the least.
Nothing will distract us.
Lighten up.

I had nothing to do with that situation.
He came back after dark.
They went crazy.
I have hardly any English books.
She is not wrong.
I didn't have much time.
We're both teachers.
Tom died three weeks ago after being bitten by a cobra.
He found it very hard to keep the conversation going.

She was livid when she found out all the lies he'd told her.
You're free to go.
Bring me the newspaper.

When will they give a concert?
We won.
Do you agree to our proposal?
I hope you're wrong about this.
I didn't think we'd be able to get in.
Do you have anything to eat?
I owe you a big one for getting me out of the jam.
So what happened?
I'll do as you advise.
Summer vacation is soon.
I don't think I could do that.
I don't know what we're talking about.
You can swim much better than he can.
I suppose that's all right.
This year is going to be prosperous.
He touched me.

Surprisingly, I agree with Tom.
What is this called?
Everything that you say may be used against you.
They're all liars.

I know that you still love me.
Your theory has no scientific basis.
Are you still interested?
I'm in the car.

This coat is nice, but too expensive.
These all belong to me.
Tom has a lot of money in the bank.
What would your father think?
I refuse to obey you any longer.
I believed you.
This road will take you down to the edge of Lake Biwa.
These are the steps that lead straight to failure.
Something isn't right.
What are you doing, Dad?
I will shoot him.
She advised him to work harder.
This might be the last time we ever see each other.
We need to buy a new rug for this room.
I can't accept this gift.
I hate to see you so miserable.
Tom doesn't like the color of the walls in his bedroom.
These books are all mine.
I feel better than I did.
I really like this one.
We must tell him about it.
Buy a book and read it.
Why are you picking a fight with me?
What did you expect to happen?
Thank you for your recommendation.
Did I say I was finished?

I have no friends supporting me.
He got well again.
That has nothing to do with it.
He brought food to his guest and provided him shelter.

I just started crying.
It's no use arguing with him.
I use an electric toothbrush.
I managed to finish the work.
Have you read this book yet?
We're going to give it another try.
As far as I know, he's an excellent student.
One of the dogs started barking.
Tom certainly hadn't done anything that deserved that kind of punishment.
We're not happy.
I finally broke down and bought the game my son had been asking me for.
Are you watching carefully?
I didn't think we'd need it.
I plan to stay at home all day tomorrow.
We're quite alone.
Turn toward me, please.
I've got to learn some new songs.
Tom couldn't kill anyone.
This is a friend of mine.
That's a book.
Did you recognize Tom?
I didn't think I was going to win.
Human relationships are complex.
I'd like to hear exactly how Tom managed to get that old car running again.
I want to get there early so we can get good seats.
I am surprised that she refused such a good offer.
We don't have to go.
There's still room for improvement.
The first time, she wasn't very firm with him.
That wouldn't be smart.
She's about the same age as me.
What he said is a good idea.
She tried a third time.
She lost her new watch.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.

This is not my specialty.
Which of you will go?
You're no singer.
You are seriously ill.
I thought it was good.
She advised him that he should stay at home.
He caught three fish.
Her youngest child is five years old.
I am prepared for the worst.
They don't need to do it right away.
I'm loaded.
What are you hinting at?
I can't sleep at all!
Does this mean you won't be sleeping here?
The house that Tom built is really nice.
What does the cat want?
How is your dad?
Is that a bat?
I'm more than happy.
It is impossible to do it.
How many people were there?
Tom has my book.
I'm sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
I am convinced that he is innocent.
I was angry at myself.
There is a TV remote control under the couch.
I hope you'll come back.
I'd be unhappy if that happened again.
I have to talk to you alone.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
This app automatically signs you in when you open it.
This is private property.
You can rely on him.
This is very important to us.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
The box was crushed during transport and the contents flew out.
I suppose you're right.
They were all hysterical.
Are you talking to yourself again?
I can't see anything from here.
Be careful.
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
You're the first person I told that to.
What can I get rid of?
His reply was negative.
I don't think I could ever get used to this smell.
He was absent from the meeting.
You look just like your mother.
Check your order.
I teach French.
Lock the office.
We ran into each other at the station.
France is in western Europe.
How come you didn't come to the party?
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
Come off it!
I haven't told Tom anything.
My office faces Fifth Avenue.
He lives in Nagasaki.
They made sure nobody could see them.
She cleaned her room in a hurry.
Ask him if he will attend the meeting.
I reached the village before dark.
Can you swim underwater?
You're such a cute boy.
Me, too.
I had two copies of the book.
He and I are cousins.
She didn't want to sell the book.
I'm very happy with my purchase.
It's not that complicated.
The current president has many enemies.
That's an order.
By the way, how old are you?
You ran a red light.
You must find work.
She was a medical student.
Tom is sitting in the back.
Folks, it's time I was leaving.
Tom and Mary were worried.
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with him.
I want to buy my bike back.
What's it smell like?
I'm leaving now.
I thought there was a possibility that Tom was going to break the contract.
Do you believe me now?
He is far from rich.
An American spoke to me at the station.
The young man saved the child from drowning.
He ran outside naked.
I did my best.
Is that so bad?
He offered no specific explanation for his strange behavior.
His house was struck by lightning.
That bottle is in the dirt.
You should be a writer.
I'm just helping out.
Wait till six.
Do you think Tom is sick?
He often eats breakfast there.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
Will you come back tomorrow?
Where do you think we came from?
I'd like to reconfirm my flight.
Stop pestering me, I'm busy.
Did you really do that?
That's exactly what I wanted to do.
I'd like to have these pants cleaned.
You've had enough.
I'll let you know when she arrives.
Her explanation concerning that matter matches yours.
It must be nice to have friends in high places.
The population of Shanghai is as large as that of Tokyo.
This is a small book.
My dream is to go to Japan someday.
Without you, I'm nothing.
We ran out of money.
You've got a vivid imagination!
I know you're in love with me.
Bring along something to read.
You're very talented.
They told me it was your fault.
He got 90% in English.
I was concerned.
He often walks to school.
Don't let anything else distract us.
He's broke.
What's your favorite class this year?
That dress seems to be very expensive.
I'm still married.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
I'm expecting a call.
Poland is a big country.
I think you're ready.
This Sunday is Mother's Day in Spain.
What flower do you like best?
It is said that the poor are not always unhappy.
What a dump.
My heart was in my throat.
You can't leave me.
He talks as if he knew the secret.
The river flooded the entire region.
Do I know you?
When did you become a teacher?
He lifted her in the air.
Your ideas are all out of date.
Sleeping in class is not allowed.
I have three chickens in my house.
How did you come by this painting?
Take the bags upstairs.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
Several students came to the library.
Stop acting like a jerk.
Could you buy everything you needed?
He usually comes home late.
You should know that by now.
She interpreted his remarks as a threat.
Are you sure that's necessary?
Tom is being held prisoner somewhere.
I met my teacher on the way to the station.
She accused me of telling a lie.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
I had to be sure.
Why don't you meet me out front in a few minutes?
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
Are you that stupid?
You can't play baseball here.
Help me and I will help you.
They invited them to dinner.
I found the book I had long been looking for.
I didn't really feel like going out.
I would very much like to go.
A white dove is on the roof.
At least we're still in one piece.
The house is small, but it's enough for us.
Which writing system is the most difficult in the world?
I took a cab to the station.
Don't be so hard on me.
They're right behind you.
He died before I arrived.
We're getting a lot of things done.
There's one small problem.
They're disposable.
I find it hard to get up early on cold mornings.
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
I agree completely.
I paid for the damage.
Trust me on this.
The heavy snow made them put off their departure.
I didn't feel like going out this evening.
I'm really not all that hungry.
I hope to marry her.
Mother placed a large vase on the shelf.
I knew you'd like it.
I want to ask you something.
I guessed right.
It's awful.
You're very nice.
Whose shoes are these?
I see nothing wrong with this.
Don't you tell me to relax.
They're all terrified.
I'm going to New York next week.
I don't want to hear another complaint about you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
You need to be more patient.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
It is strange that he should say so.
I'd never betray your trust.
I can't believe you're still single.
Go up these stairs.
Our financial problems are serious.
I finally found out what had been causing the pain in my leg.
She avoided answering my questions.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
Could you find a room for my sister?
He never cared much for me.
I did what you asked.
I'd like to thank everyone who helped.
A pretty waitress waited on us.
The man ate bread.
They all thought Tom was crazy.
Please give my regards to your parents.
I'm sorry about last night.
Let me write down the steps for you.
That's not what I had in mind.
It was a nightmare.
I used to go swimming in the sea when I was a child.
I had to change the plan.
She treated him very well.
It was no trouble.
They won't listen to you.
We looked at each other.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
Who's your father?
Suddenly, it became noisy.
My father is an archaeologist.
He is the oldest of them all.
He's my best friend.
I didn't like the result.
I just stubbed my toe.
Tell him I'm not in.
They let me pick a present.
Where did you get that scar?
Tom poisoned Mary's dog.
It's very kind of you.
It looks good on paper.
She had her handbag stolen.
How did you hurt your arm?
We're obedient.
Did you choose an interesting book for your son?
She lost sight of her friend in the huge crowd.
You're depressed, aren't you?
Have you ever been kissed?
We've had a very hard winter.
There is no escape.
Look at all these boxes.
I opened an account in my daughter's name.
What have we done to be punished like this?
Whether you believe it or not, I believe it.
You are too young to travel alone.
This is the strangest thing I've ever done.
I've been drinking.
They are my classmates.
Walk as fast as possible.
I have kidney trouble.
Remain seated, please.
Tom went back to his room and lay down.
You can't keep me here.
You have no idea how much that means to me.
Not a sound was heard in the room.
There's nothing funny about that.
I can't take another step.
My clock seems to be broken.
She appears to have many friends.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
Tom went home with Mary.
I should have told you everything earlier.
The alarm clock is ringing.
I let go of the rope.
She stammers when she feels nervous.
The leaves have all fallen.
I think we should go take a look.
Do you think I did it?
London's climate differs from that of Tokyo.
I'd like you to be my partner.
That street is very noisy.
Would you consider taking care of my children next Saturday?
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
I've got two brothers.
This shop is a rental video shop.
Tom told us that he had a headache.
Do you go to church?
He has given up running in order to focus on the long jump.
The soldiers were guarding the bridge.
They saw him enter the room.
I should probably not be doing this.
I told you not to do that.
I have no desire to understand what goes on inside your head.
I don't consider that adequate.
After a slow summer season, business began to pick up.
I don't really understand how that works.
I just followed your instructions.
You are children.
Please refrain from smoking here.
I'll buy it.
I'm really disappointed in you, Tom.
I'd like to look at that chart.
I'm afraid it will rain.
I must hand in the report today.
I know how this looks to you.
Tom seems unable to do that.
They are running in the park.
Do you have to go now?
We'll never know who he is.
You had better do what they say.
That's not what I was thinking.
Do you have a problem?
That wasn't good.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
I have many friends who are native speakers.
He hammered at the window.
The girl and her parents were very sympathetic.
I read the article about you in yesterday's newspaper.
Can I come in now?
Stand back!
Do you have beer?
We can talk this through.
You may have that opportunity.
Thirty-four of them were lawyers.
Water the plants.
You need to help me do this.
I am not sure whether I will be able to come with you.
Let's paint the town red.
Our team can win.
Do you think that dress suits her?
I wish I had a room of my own.
Tom told me he was single.
When did the accident take place?
Do you mind if I go?
People often lie about what they did on the weekend, so their friends won't realize how boring they really are.
I was so drunk last night.
Did I have a choice?
I want you to know what's true and what's not.
I can't think of anything that I'd like better.
Please excuse me for being rude.
There's a lot of room left for improvement.
We received a cordial welcome from them.
She advised him to lose weight.
I just want to be his friend.
The offer is too good to turn down.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
What's the deal here?
They are artists.
He's too busy.
Mommy, if I don't like the food, do I have to eat it?
We want you to be the team captain.
He will keep us informed.
There were three coffee mugs on the table.
She has an agreeable voice.
I decided not to go.
Cockfighting is banned in many countries.
We have to reduce the cost to a minimum.
It means a lot to me.
She's a fox.
I ran out of gas.
I don't need to know.
She was on the point of going out.
Everyone started laughing.
Do you love my brother more than me?
I'm glad I could be of some assistance.
Ask your parents for permission.
I'd be much obliged if you could give me a lift into town.
You shouldn't take the things Tom says seriously.
Anyone can do that.
I appreciate your patience.
How do you take your coffee?
Tom asked Mary's advice about the problem.
When did the accident take place?
I think you should think about the future.
Once he had written the letter, he sent it.
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
I cannot bring myself to do such a thing.
Things are looking great.
It won't be long before he is up and about.
I really can't talk about it now.
The cancer has spread to her stomach.
I already called him.
They'll grow.
I expect Tom won't want to do that.
I'm not racist.
A fallen leaf floated on the surface of the water.
They are still children.
Who notified you?
Does she know your phone number?
I wasn't flirting.
I'll stand.
I am shorter than you.
What we have is one thing and what we are is quite another.
Here it is.
There's room for improvement.
Are you coming to the party tonight?
Tom put a flea collar on his dog.
This door is locked from the inside.
No child should go hungry.
Thanks to the bad weather, the game was canceled.
She is giving a party tonight.
She tried to persuade him to organize a boycott.
Everything went wrong.
I'm afraid for his life.
Full religious freedom is assured to all people.
Make a wish.
They agreed on everything.
The weather is terrible today.
A table has four legs.
I can't take my glasses off.
You can't know that for sure.
I think that would be nice.
He held his breath while watching the match.
He has money.
The public was notified on October 20th.
Why are you all sad?
The fuse has blown.
You must not give up.
They saluted each other by raising their hats.
Tom wasn't expecting this.
You need to press the button.
Tom's glad.
I can't read this.
Were you at home yesterday?
You're the last hope for humanity.
Tom began whistling a tune.
I'll do that for Tom.
He is watching TV now.
You should have your eyes examined.
I feel like I know you already.
She knew the teen.
I would like to pay with a credit card.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I know you're not going to come to my party, but I wish you were.
We've already seen this movie.
It was obviously a joke.
I just did what they told me to do.
I remember seeing him somewhere.
My glass is dirty.
The cat fell asleep curled up in front of the fireplace.
Everyone voted yes. No one objected.
He speaks Chinese.
You're a wonderful woman.
That's the way it is.
The summer here is quite warm.
Have you been up all night?
What illness do I have?
Do you want me to ask Tom?
Tom drank too much.
I saw you.
I'll give him a buzz.
Be careful about what you eat.
The present time is a good time.
I'd say you did well.
Tell Tom that I need his help.
No one welcomed the proposal.
No one came.
They don't always obey their parents.
I used to listen to English programs.
Where did you get on this bus?
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy.
Tom didn't know what Mary's last name was.
Did you enjoy yourself at the party last night?
My father is intelligent.
Tom said he found something strange.
I am not equal to the task.
You shouldn't take the things Tom says seriously.
Did you know this at the time?
Tom forgot to pay his rent.
I need someone to hold me and tell me everything will be alright.
Be careful.
We're sloshed.
You're still single, aren't you?
Recreational drug use inspires many urban legends.
I will never force you to marry him.
She gave him the brush off.
I went to Disneyland yesterday.
Osaka is Japan's second biggest city.
How do we stop it?
Furry rabbits are so cute.
It is getting darker and darker.
He runs in the park every day.
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
Please tell me your name.
My parents caught me smoking.
Am I going to die?
She closed her eyes.
Where are you working?
He had no coat on.
I want to teach you something.
Why did I trust you?
I'm begging you, before freaking out on me listen to the end of what I have to say.
I know that you feel helpless.
Can anyone pronounce this word?
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
The water flooded the streets.
Tom knocked Mary down.
Get your gear.
I hadn't thought of that.
What makes you think you won't be able to do it?
Are you real sure about that?
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Do you know who said that?
I realized I couldn't win.
It's poison.
I wonder if it really was a coincidence.
Are you from around here?
Let's take your temperature first.
The radio will not work.
Did you see anybody else?
Stop right there, please.
Who is that person?
I'll cook bacon and eggs.
I thought you might want some breakfast.
We haven't even discussed that yet.
I think I can do it.
I made my son a new suit.
Do you know what day it is today?
I think it's time for me to get a new pair of glasses.
They told me I had to help you.
Don't interfere with him if you want him to like you.
I thought it would be a good concert, but it wasn't.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Close the door when you leave.
I am being paranoid, aren't I?
My son's short attention span is causing him problems at school.
Having done the work, she has nothing to do.
Tom is living in a small apartment on Park Street.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
You could've been hurt.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
He closed the door.
They begged us to help them.
Tom doesn't want to be disappointed.
I keep my word.
My grandmother lives by herself.
They argue a lot, but for the most part they get along quite well together.
I didn't have to open the letter. I knew exactly what it said.
That is not exactly what I said.
It's too early for you to come.
A day has twenty-four hours.
The river is deep here.
He goes to the office by car.
I stopped off at Osaka on my way to Tokyo.
The hunters aimed at the elephant.
I appreciate your restraint.
I regret eating those oysters.
I still don't get it.
I dislike her unfriendly attitude.
Have you decided on the subject of your thesis?
The last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat vegetables.
When you've finished reading that book, I'd like to read it.
Only Takeuchi didn't accept the invitation.
I learned it from you.
I took on the job of proofreading.
You're fortunate.
The blood stain can't be removed.
Let me bring you up to speed.
Tom hesitated.
Please choose wisely.
I'll get fired if I don't do it.
Get a job.
You almost died.
I agree with what you say to some extent.
Is this new model available on the market?
There seem to be lots and lots of stars.
Get up out of bed.
Come here.
He intruded on her privacy.
Give me five days.
There were fifty entries for the race.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I don't know what your problem is.
I can't believe I missed this before.
My girlfriend is crying.
I can't come right now.
Don't be alarmed.
She advised him to cut down on smoking, but he didn't think that he could.
The man hit me on the head.
The Soviet troops started to withdraw from Afghanistan.
We've just spent two weeks apart.
I don't want to offend you.
Let me get this straight.
What do you think you'd like to do next time?
You may choose any of them.
We abandoned the plan to go on a picnic.
I hate that more than anything.
Tom is very independent-minded.
Raise your hand before you answer.
Don't let go. Hold on tight.
I need to take your temperature.
How many more are there?
How did you get into Harvard?
The light has turned green.
It is quiet here at night.
You almost died.
Let's take a walk.
Inflation is getting out of control.
I can't believe you're taking pictures of cockroaches.
The doctor is not available now.
The next station is where you get off.
Tom knew that Mary was in danger.
Tom's not the slightest bit interested in my suggestion.
We're studying now.
Can you still remember when we first met?
Is the mouse dead or alive?
She got caught.
I can't speak French at all.
Check these out.
The couple broke off their engagement.
He is likely to win the game.
How are things at school?
Only a handful of people know the fact.
Bring me a glass of water, please.
You are really very good.
Nobody's going to blame you.
How come you didn't call me last night?
The boys have gone north.
Hurry up, girls.
How dare you say such a thing!
She is proud of her son.
I saw something interesting.
Turn down the volume.
I think I have an idea.
They're here until the end of the week.
It's popular among senior citizens.
It was nice and cool there.
I will visit my uncle in Kyoto this summer.
Tom obviously didn't know about it.
They had a heated discussion.
I hope you will be completely cured.
I attempted to solve the problem.
You're replaceable.
Roses smell sweet.
Everybody has already left.
I hate to run the risk, but I have no choice.
Thank you for your kind words.
How could you not see this coming?
I'm sorry I'm such a big disappointment to you.
I slept with the light off.
He's not a hero.
He adapted the story for children.
He's not one of us.
This decision is final.
I hope you enjoyed the show.
Take that back.
Yesterday I hit on a good idea.
It was not my fault.
I heard a noise coming from the next room.
I saw him in the park.
By the way, where are you from?
The plane will take off in one hour.
You always want to control everything.
Lock the doors.
Everything went as planned.
Who is the girl in your car?
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
His brazen act of defiance almost cost him his life.
The dogs bayed at the full moon.
We had not gone very far when it started to rain.
I play video games.
Why do I have to do this by myself?
DNA tests showed he was innocent.
Were you even tempted?
My mother has good handwriting.
Let me read you something.
Have you ever seen a film this good?
We surrender.
I like it when it's cold.
I miss my cat.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
I bought lots of books.
In case it rains, I won't go.
What was the cause of the accident?
It doesn't hurt at all.
He has been living in the cabin by himself for more than ten years.
I have a schedule to keep.
The boy complained of a headache.
I feel sick.
That is just typical of him.
The apples he sent me were delicious.
I never received the money.
Tom likes to travel.
They went whale watching.
Do you know who killed Tom?
What made him change his mind?
The system isn't flawless.
I would do anything to get a job.
I am okay.
Stop following me.
I've already cleaned my room.
I know I can't take Tom's place.
I'll lend you any book that I have, as long as you keep it clean.
It is true he is rich, but he is a miser.
You're very curious.
I should've listened to what my mother said.
She seems timid, but she's actually a strong-willed person.
Men know nothing about women.
They live in the same state.
I have an old bicycle.
Would you please stop talking?
I guess I don't understand what you're trying to say.
My father implied our summer trip was arranged.
The little girl hid in the closet.
He demanded better pay.
Man has the gift of speech.
I would like to marry somebody like her.
I am moving next month.
My bedroom is crawling with spiders.
What if I refuse?
Can you ship it to New York City?
He is wearing gloves.
Fortunately, no one was hurt.
I don't worry about that kind of stuff.
Did I hurt you?
You were there, weren't you?
You don't get enough exercise.
You should keep your promise.
Is there something you want to ask?
You are important.
I consider him a great writer.
I remember this.
I want a jump rope with wooden handles.
A mist hung over the river.
I feel very cold.
Let's not allow that to happen.
She is an appalling cook.
If you need any help, ask me.
All I ask is that you show up on time.
Taking a taxi is a luxury for me.
He looks just like his mother.
He was unconscious of his guilt.
Maybe you should quit drinking.
I learned a valuable lesson today.
Have you tried it before?
Get that book for me.
You didn't make it clear.
Tom ate all of the chocolate.
That's very considerate of you.
What's all that racket?
Tom elbowed me in the ribs.
Are you looking for somebody?
Tom doesn't have to go if he doesn't want to.
I have back problems.
He learned to swim.
Get your mother to do your homework!
He likes me and I like him too.
I can't do my job without a computer.
Do you like the way you look?
I like him.
It was near the river that I lost my way.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
You're conscientious.
You heard correctly.
Night is when most people sleep.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
Forget it. It's too risky.
It is very hot today.
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is go there without your permission.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
Go look for it.
That's pretty much everything you need to know.
He wants you to come home.
He married my cousin.
She stayed here by herself.
You don't have to answer.
I've had a lot on my mind lately.
He swallowed his pride.
She is a beginner.
Ten minutes after they had passed Nara, the car ran out of gas.
This amount includes tax.
I'm serious about my job.
What you said does not apply to this case.
You'll have to pay double.
Our supply of food is exhausted.
Hand me that phone.
The room has two windows.
My sister has made remarkable progress in English.
I feel like I'm ready.
I'll have to do it myself.
You never have any doubts, do you?
You're temperamental.
I have enjoyed myself very much.
You're the only friend I have.
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
Be polite to your parents.
How's your boy doing?
They accused me of being a liar.
Tom could go to prison.
Do it the way he tells you to.
We want our money back.
She made the doll for me.
His debt came to 100 dollars.
I had to drag him out of bed.
What precisely does that mean?
He lives frugally.
What color is your hair?
The dog jumped over a chair.
I got soap in my eyes.
A few minutes' walk brought him to the zoo.
I feel dizzy.
Would you like to sing?
Are you telling me you're not involved?
The crocodile is a protected species.
May I use the bathroom?
Stay out of my kitchen.
I heard somebody talking.
We got behind the car and pushed.
I had a problem with my car.
Do you speak Chinese well?
Nobody wants to work with you.
Take your shot.
He lost his ticket for the movie.
I'm sorry, I don't let in people I don't know.
I feel like I'm going to be lucky tonight.
A fund was set up with a view to preserving our endangered planet.
I knew every one of those guys.
How much milk is there left?
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
You should spend what little time you have left with your friends.
Come again tomorrow.
Tie the horse to that tree.
You can't be thirty years old.
He ran across the street, leaving her alone.
My father is a businessman.
Would you like some cookies?
He will be waiting for you.
He has her under his thumb.
I won't buy one.
That was quite a speech.
By the way, have you heard from her since then?
He has hardly any money, but he gets by.
As soon as I can get the chance, I'll help your mother paint the fence.
The meeting is ten days away.
I'll pray for you.
Do you shower every day?
What are we supposed to do?
You and I are good friends.
I like what you've written.
Do you smell something?
Do you want to go?
A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him around.
A black and white dog bit me.
Absence of rain caused the plants to die.
What's the weight of your suitcase?
I was horrified.
I figured it out by myself.
We're winners.
You don't owe me anything.
You owe me a favor.
It can't be helped.
This is the boy who found your watch.
You don't look so well.
When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room.
He entered the army.
I ran away in a hurry.
They do not waste anything nor throw anything away.
I am not your enemy.
I'd better call you back.
It seemed likely.
Look in the mirror.
Where do we go after we die?
You're very timid.
I wish you'd never been born.
He gave her a foot massage.
Tom does nothing but watch TV.
She demanded to see the manager.
He didn't want to sell the book.
Do you know where my watch is?
We all have secrets.
We were all drenched with perspiration.
She'd like him to leave right away.
Has it occurred to you that you might be the one with the problem?
Why do I have to do this by myself?
The train will probably arrive at the station before noon.
I don't want this shirt.
This is our only hope.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
I wasn't in a hurry.
I like to think so.
She promised to marry him.
I always stretch my leg muscles before playing tennis.
What time will you have breakfast?
He tried it again, but in vain.
The crowd cried out for an encore.
He has no right to interfere in our family affairs.
I just can't wait to go to work.
The thief was bound hand and foot.
I didn't mean to surprise you.
They said they would not fight.
He wrote to me from time to time.
The radio is too loud.
The tactic worked.
Show me how to do that.
Tom spent three years in prison.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
Do you know how many people live in Australia?
They're still together.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Tom grabbed his coat.
What are we supposed to do?
No matter what happens, I won't be surprised.
Your camera is only half the size of mine.
You don't have to eat it.
He has been to Switzerland before.
I said there's no one here.
Make your choice.
You're too trusting.
I thought I heard music.
Is the plane on schedule?
How much did you pay for that?
He knows a lot of people.
It isn't the same thing.
You're a funny guy.
I lived in Sasayama two years ago.
He is a fishmonger.
Science is cool.
This melon will be good to eat tomorrow.
He sells whisky.
I seem to have a temperature.
He told me about it.
This is a portrait of my late father.
You have to keep fit.
They got the short end of the stick.
Tom seems to need to go to the bathroom.
You're not being rational.
A car hit Tom.
Dr. Skeleton is known for his study on ghosts.
I'm still not ready yet.
She's as good a cook as her mother.
Can I tell you what bugs me?
Forty people attended.
Father is in his office.
How does it work?
Mistakes were made.
I usually have dessert after dinner.
Even my mom knows.
I just didn't sleep well.
You must realize that I can't help you.
They're speaking French.
Are you going to a movie?
It's very dry.
Protesters tried to disrupt the meeting.
These boxes are made of plastic.
Let's go grab a burger or something.
I feel terrible about that.
We happened to meet at the station.
She gave me a fake phone number.
A mirror reflects light.
You must not take advantage of her innocence.
I wanted your cooperation.
I suppose so.
I started to learn English with the aim of becoming a teacher.
It was at that very moment that the bomb went off.
I received an invitation.
Thousands of people were there.
I only feed my dog dry dog food.
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
We can't win.
Could you please tell me again how many times you've been here?
I can think of several reasons.
I was beginning to worry about you.
I am French.
I know Tom cheated.
It's too dark to play tennis now.
I have to go to work.
If you want one, you'll have to find your own.
Don't give up without a fight.
No one is unbeatable.
The meeting will be held next week at the earliest.
You should go home early.
You can't keep me here.
They can't do this.
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
I find that funny.
We're going to search the whole ship.
There you are.
Which planet is closest to the sun?
Tom isn't the type of person who learns from his mistakes.
Whose handwriting is this?
They must have known it all along.
Who's watching?
I am of the opinion that this is the way to do it.
You did your part.
The very idea of it is disgusting.
I am going to play soccer tomorrow.
Let's open the window.
Get out of my room!
I'm really sleepy.
Where on earth can he have gone off to at this time of day?
I can show you a better time.
Wouldn't you like to drink some tea?
Thanks for adding me as a friend.
I had to go back.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
I'm a salesman for our company.
I had to do it by myself.
He is American.
When did you get married?
Who tried to kill Tom?
I'm talking.
I wasn't strong enough.
He is doing well.
Put this on my tab, please.
My brother lives in Tokyo.
They handled it well.
I ride my bike to work.
I don't particularly want to be here at all.
She cooks for him every day, but he doesn't appreciate it.
Is she your sister?
Keep reading.
I want to be careful.
My mother cleans the room.
It's not always cold in Boston.
The drunk driver had to spend the night in jail.
I do that sometimes.
They could not get there quickly.
Stay out of this.
You need to lose weight.
He fell into a deep depression and decided to off himself.
Tom died trying to save a child from a burning building.
I remember seeing you somewhere.
I grew up in this small town.
How are you going to manage?
I borrowed this comic book from his sister.
I plan on winning.
If you taste this sauce you'll find it a bit salty.
I'm not sure I like this.
He made her his wife.
What is your registration number?
I can't believe I listened to you.
I want you to be my manager.
Don't ask me to do that.
Tom isn't serious, is he?
I don't have the patience for this.
Is that seat available?
He is an honest man.
A man touched down on the moon. A wall came down in Berlin. A world was connected by our own science and imagination.
Tom didn't have enough experience in dealing with that kind of problem.
His explanation was not satisfactory.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
A few glasses of wine can loosen the tongue.
He shrugged his shoulders.
These new cars are on sale.
I was forced to go.
I think I've seen that guy somewhere before.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
It's a quarter to three.
I always walk.
I love trying to do new things.
I'm asking you to do this because I trust you.
This coffee tastes bitter.
Did you do yesterday's homework?
Tom's phone can take pictures.
Please spend a few minutes thinking about this.
I don't feel like eating anything.
You made a horrible mistake.
What did you hide?
I'll never be able to do that without your help.
I saw a man with a child.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
Many people also considered him a madman.
I can't sleep well.
I'm faster.
She apologized to him for being late.
Do you have your keys?
I have something to ask Tom.
I'm disappointed and angry.
Every time I go to his house, he is out.
Children often do stupid things.
Dinner is ready, so we can eat whenever we want.
You'll call me, won't you?
Please be careful.
Both of you are wrong.
Who is the boy swimming in the river?
I don't want to be chosen.
It was broken.
How can I help these people?
I like cookies.
Please send me a catalogue.
I'm so proud of you.
It reminded me of you.
I'm not sure I understand.
There's no doubt.
What is the total number of students?
We want to talk to you.
I like movies.
I want you to get out of town.
We're up early.
How did you come by this painting?
The dog is on the chair.
I wonder if Tom can come.
She was the first one to help him.
There is a key on the desk.
Are you looking for something?
I trust him.
That will do.
I suddenly realized what was happening.
No one believed me.
Did you do something new with your hair?
That's the safest way, isn't it?
It looked fresh.
I think I've seen enough.
I'll rip your head off!
Tom isn't a good swimmer.
I don't know how he can live in this mess.
Have you received an answer to your letter?
The boy made a paper plane.
The construction crews worked around the clock.
I can't possibly manage it.
She insulted him.
I'm too old for this.
Nothing is left to chance.
Do you have a recent photo of yourself?
You should make good on your promises.
I made it myself.
Since the Industrial Revolution, the world population has more than tripled.
He's got what it takes to make it in the business world.
She didn't show up.
How much did you pay for the dress?
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Don't ask questions. Just follow orders.
Why didn't you tell me that last night?
Tom doesn't know where Mary usually goes skiing.
No one can see.
Tom doesn't know what he's doing, does he?
That's a good approach.
I'm done with you.
I want to finish this work by five.
God sent a sign.
We really want to win.
I'll give you a lift home.
I don't even want to hazard a guess.
The cancer has spread to her stomach.
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
He was panting.
There are plenty of rocks.
Do you need a deposit?
Tom was nowhere in sight.
You have my number. Call me sometime.
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
I can't speak German.
I am a man.
I'm very lonely here.
You're wrong again.
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
You are twice as strong as I am.
I can't find the right man for me.
I think we need more time.
You're lucky that you have a job.
Can you tell me the time?
They accept students like Tom.
This one is all yours.
You may eat anything as long as you don't eat too much.
Christmas is coming.
I've no idea.
Your dinner is getting cold.
We're getting closer.
He hardly works.
A tear ran down her cheek.
He continued the experiment.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I love Arabic.
Whose bicycle is this?
I go to the beach almost every day.
She had only a small sum of money.
Either you or I must go in his place.
They tried to cheer me up.
My computer works fine now.
It's not possible to wait.
I was alone in the classroom.
Don't interfere with him if you want him to like you.
It is up to you to decide what to do.
I'm pretty angry.
I called them.
Drop your gun!
He is sure to come.
I like to study English.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
When did he get back?
How's it going to happen?
What's that?
This movie is rated PG-13.
It needs washing.
She asked me to come to her bedside.
We're so proud of you!
It's so typical.
I'm proud of myself.
We get on OK.
You have something of a reputation.
She was unconscious for three days.
Tom started to take off his jacket.
Best of luck to you.
I lost my umbrella.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
They don't like to do that.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
Look after Tom.
It's not what I wanted to say.
You're very sophisticated.
We must create a safe environment for our children.
Is that what he wants?
I want to do it.
It's what I am.
Get rid of them.
There have been a lot of complaints from consumers that our products don't last as long as we claim.
Our eyes met.
Why do you want a dog?
The lion is the king of the jungle.
She is at work right now.
Which way is the beach?
I really have to go.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
That cheese is made from goat's milk.
Would you tell me the time, please?
They were yours.
I am in a spot.
He has already begun.
We better be going.
My shoes are worn out.
I wanted to make you feel at home.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to stay.
Those who know him like him.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
There are too many people here. Let's go somewhere else.
We ran for 10 kilometers.
He came downstairs.
This is something I don't understand.
Stay very still.
I don't need whatever it is you're selling.
Can you hold on a little longer?
We were all so busy then.
Don't be so reserved.
I do not like any of these hats.
You're too suspicious about everything.
I hope you have brains enough to see the difference.
At the party, everybody was well-dressed.
I know how busy you are.
He set fire to his own house.
Get in the car and lock the doors.
Once upon a time, there lived a poor man and a rich woman.
He asked after my mother.
She helped him tie his tie.
We're a bit busy at the moment. Can you hang on a minute?
Do they like wine?
It's not just a game.
Nobody's going to shed any tears if that old building gets torn down.
Is she at home?
First of all, we have to finish the homework.
We're having breakfast.
This book is interesting.
I live with my mother, brother and my grandparents.
I am never free on Sundays.
I could kill you now.
That accident is a very good example of what happens when you're not careful.
Won't you have some cake?
He's incredibly talented.
I want permission to go home early.
The Japanese art of flower arrangement is called Ikebana.
Everyone jumped into the pool.
I assume so.
My father made me what I am.
I should think she is under thirty.
I paid a lot of money for these.
Everyone in her class likes her.
I dream about you every night.
Do you shower every day?
If only I'd been a couple of years older, they would've let me into the bar.
For your own safety, never ride in a car with a drunk driver.
I don't know if it will rain tomorrow or not.
You're cheating.
You're very busy.
How old is the oldest one?
I paid for the purchase in cash.
She was advised by him to listen to her doctor.
I think we need more water.
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
Stand back, please.
Do you plan to buy that car?
Help yourself.
I know you're busy, too.
She asked me whether she could use the telephone.
You weren't serious, were you?
Everyone is doing it.
You're stuck.
You should ask your parents for permission.
There isn't much butter left in the refrigerator.
He left school two weeks ago.
I still find it hard to believe.
She was on the verge of killing herself.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the train.
Why didn't you tell someone?
May I talk with you in private about the matter?
They announced that they were going to have a party.
He is old enough to travel alone.
It's popular with students.
We'll miss Tom.
People throughout the north were angry.
I admire you for your courage.
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have a pet?
I must have my work finished by tomorrow.
Don't be so careless!
Life's not easy.
You don't frighten me.
The life span of a butterfly is short.
This is what I found in the cave.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
She has a beautiful tan.
Stay out of trouble.
You'd better sit here.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
Do you drink beer?
My heart aches for those starving children.
Her diaries formed the basis of the book she later wrote.
You will always be there.
How come you didn't come to the party?
How much does this book cost?
She couldn't attend the morning church service.
What time is it now by your watch?
The dog must be hungry.
You should not keep people waiting.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Piercings can be a form of rebellion for teenagers.
We have less than three hours left.
He bought the picture for next to nothing.
You should apologize.
Are you sure that's safe?
I heard that Tom doesn't speak French.
What are some foods you usually eat with red wine?
I'd like to apologize for this morning.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
I often play soccer after school.
Our train is late.
Please replace the empty printer cartridge.
My dream came true.
Quito, Ecuador, is a little south of the equator.
When it comes to sweets, I just can't control myself.
Tom got home later than usual today.
I can't wait for him any longer.
Tom asked Mary where she had parked the car.
The meat is tough.
I can't see my dad.
He seems to be sick.
I had an asthma attack.
My room's a little messy.
What were you doing?
I was just curious.
I prefer tea to coffee.
I really misjudged you.
What do you do in the afternoon?
I don't feel comfortable here.
I missed the last train last Friday.
That's the point.
You've been selected.
I quit smoking and drinking.
Did you tell Tom what he needed to know?
I keep a rabbit as a pet.
That one over there's really cute.
Many revolutions have aimed to abolish the aristocracy.
I will be sixteen in May.
Do you like white wine?
Do you want to see some magic?
Please make yourself at home.
There is an urgent need for clean energy.
The cost of living has increased drastically.
That type of person almost never asks for a raise.
He went skiing.
How's the weather?
I dropped out of college.
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
You're cruel.
It's four o'clock by my watch.
Do you like your coworkers?
There's a sucker born every minute.
He's a hopeless case.
You're sitting in my chair.
What would you do without me?
I like his attitude.
Don't let go of the rope.
This house is creepy.
She revealed her secret to us.
The school is on the hill.
She began to sing.
I will tell her what to say at the meeting.
We're just beginning.
You can always count on him in any emergency.
I'm innocent.
Could you teach me how to play the piano?
He moved from place to place.
You must quit drinking.
They are reading their newspapers.
I was not feeling well.
Tom was sitting behind me.
They had a heated discussion.
Forget your sorrows.
I'm just a plain office worker.
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
Is this a challenge?
He is responsible for the accident.
I figured that would make you laugh.
I feel so helpless.
A man was complaining of something in a sharp voice.
We'll manage.
He lacks judgement.
A man appeared from behind the door.
I don't know either of his brothers.
He instantly fell in love with her.
Can you light the way?
My watch is broken.
I mean no disrespect.
Tom didn't understand Mary's joke.
Did you see anyone suspicious?
I'm afraid I have work to do.
The wind blew her hat off.
Did the police arrest Tom?
A few minutes' walk brought me to the shore.
Her reputation was hurt a lot by this.
That bicycle is too small for you.
You're good with kids.
Tom is extremely narrow-minded.
He was fully clothed.
Everyone else waited.
His house was sold for $10,000.
I'm going back to the office.
He requested help.
I wish I could play the guitar as well as you do.
Have you chosen a topic?
Were you at home all morning?
They are jealous of our success.
I don't know if it is true.
From personal experience, I know that any encounter with him will leave a bad taste in your mouth.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
The police are looking into it.
She advised him to take a long holiday, so he immediately quit work and took a trip around the world.
She has a large bedroom to herself.
He must like taking walks.
I had the exact same feeling.
I used to dream about being able to breathe underwater.
You should take your car to Tom's Garage. He does a pretty good job.
You won't be fired.
Do you think you would ever consider going out with me?
I am accustomed to living alone.
That's not what I had in mind.
I was really apathetic at first.
Where will we eat?
I promise you I won't ever leave you.
You know what you must do.
It is already dark.
Take this medicine when you have a cold.
A full moon is shining bright in the sky.
He can't speak much English.
You're worried, aren't you?
Tom says that's a lie.
Tom usually goes to school by bus.
Make love, not war.
My father does not always walk to work.
It's up to you.
Why did you do that?
I appreciate the invitation.
Need I go on?
They forced me to take the medicine.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
How was your afternoon?
I've never seen you like this.
The tie doesn't go with my suit.
I don't agree with him.
It won't work.
Go see a doctor.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
Of course I will go.
Every movement is painful.
It sounds healthy.
Your answer is correct.
Here's your drink.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else to read it.
Don't worry.
Where did you hear that story?
If I had known, I would have told you.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
I don't know how to say goodbye in French.
My father will often read the newspaper during meals.
A pony is a small horse.
Can I make copies?
Everyone else waited.
You can go anywhere you like.
Who's ill?
The whole class was quiet.
I need someone who I can talk to.
I'll be discreet.
She waited for him to come home.
You need to be more patient.
At least they listened to me.
I'm strong.
I think that's just what I need right now.
Rumors of defeat were circulating.
She was voted prom queen.
Would it be OK if I took a vacation next week?
We saw you.
I need a new USB cable.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
You're very direct.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
Please don't let this happen again.
He applies this principle to everything in life.
He apologized to her for being late.
Would you mind sharing your table?
Most of the shops were closed.
You do like living dangerously.
She insisted that it was my fault.
I've heard a lot about you.
I took care of it for you.
Don't you ever say that again.
Who designed the White House?
I finally caught up with my friends.
What did you want to show me?
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
You should buy her a gift card instead.
I can recommend this restaurant.
Do you like French wine?
Everyone likes them.
This chair is too low for me.
Perhaps you should buy a gun.
Tom works at home.
Nobody cares about me.
I wish I could figure out how to delete my Facebook account.
Sake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic drink.
What's the spelling of your family name?
I have to start somewhere.
Are they going to arrest Tom?
I feel like playing, too.
Just between you and me, do you love my sister?
I went to Europe before the war.
You'll never be young again.
What kind of man are you?
They're all terrified.
You're very efficient.
They ruined it.
How can I lose?
It's on my desk.
You're the one who trained me.
We needed help.
I know your mother.
No one knows exactly how many people considered themselves hippies.
As a boy, he would go to the seaside every summer.
Were you able to do everything you wanted to get done?
It's difficult to balance a ball on your nose.
You have been warned.
It's already eleven. It's high time you were in bed.
You said it yourself.
It makes sense now.
Who committed this murder?
I hope all your dreams come true.
My father doesn't eat fruit that much.
He believes that he can prove it.
I hate this car.
Let me give you a hug.
Both of them are very brilliant.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'll call you after lunch.
Certain things are better left unsaid.
They arrived at the foot of the mountain.
Don't make a scene in public.
He lives in a big house.
I can't give up.
I feel kind of nauseous.
She said she was happy.
I'm as hungry as a bear.
I can't believe that I'm really here.
He was suspended from school for a week for bad conduct.
Tom seems a little nervous.
I don't buy that.
I cannot distinguish a frog from a toad.
He's Swiss.
What'll you be doing over the weekend?
We understand each other.
There's nothing to be done about it.
I'm leaving today.
People are still scared.
You are the chosen one.
I don't care how much you want it. I'm not going to give it to you.
Do you want to make a deal?
This looks good.
Maybe you should have a little talk with Tom.
She looks confused.
I remember when I first saw you.
We can't be the only two people who're late.
This is your community.
Stay a while.
He was checking you out.
Do you agree?
Please help me take this down.
Nothing can force me to give it up.
We apologize for this inconvenience.
I have frizzy hair.
I found it there.
I just don't feel like it.
I can't be seen with you.
My doctor told me that I needed to lose some weight.
You cannot be serious.
Why did you change your mind?
Coffee, please.
Tom forgot to salute.
It is 5 miles from here to Tokyo.
My mother died when I was a kid.
That's what I'm always telling Tom.
Have you been to Kyoto?
I got what I asked for.
Where did you see her?
I don't know who did it.
The foreman docked me an hour's pay for getting to work late.
They camped on the beach.
I'm not in trouble.
She wrote to him to tell him that she couldn't come to visit next summer.
I don't want to waste your time.
We should hang out more.
Tom and I used to be neighbors.
Tom spoke to Mary.
I want a licensed guide who speaks English.
I hate that you have to be here.
Dogs wag their tails and cats swish theirs.
I think they like me.
Tom pounded on the door.
How often do you see your godparents?
I saw a house with a red roof.
My watch is different from yours.
For some reason the microphone didn't work earlier.
It is the law.
I apologize if I offended you.
I want a person who can speak French.
You should have nothing to complain about.
Do you want me to call the police?
Can I borrow your eraser for a moment?
It was a huge success.
Do you know when she will come?
This is how I met your mother.
It's not fair to attribute your failure to your parents.
Tom lost control of the car.
He read into my words a message that I hadn't intended.
Tom wasn't very impressed.
I'll try to fix it later.
How on earth can you speak that language?
Do you feel giving gifts is important?
We're always hungry.
Can eating just vegetables help you lose weight?
You can come with us.
I'm happy you two are friends again.
Did you settle the bill?
May I disturb you just a moment?
In addition to English, he can speak French.
Could you call me back later?
Michael Jackson has passed away.
If you get your right ear pierced, that means you're gay.
Let us out of here.
Get ready for some action.

He doesn't care if his car is dirty.
It seems that he believes what he said is right.
What he said applies, to a certain extent, to this case.

She advises him on technical matters.
Get us out of here.

Even wounds that have healed, leave scars behind.
That's all I can say.

I wanted to talk to you about something.

He should have taken the examination.
There's no proof.
He delivered a speech.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
I'm a little confused.
I met him just as he was coming out of school.

It's not my concern.
She learned her part very quickly.
Why do you need change?
Please contact me later.
He thinks that's normal.
Since I had a cold, I was absent from school.
The man lost all hope.

There's nothing more I can tell you.
What's making this sound?
I already ate.
His music is too noisy.
Why are you flinching?
I was too stunned to talk.
Let's discuss that problem later.
I like English better.
Is that thing yours?
You must kneel at my feet, kiss my hand and swear that I am an angel.
She's pregnant.
This sentence needs to be checked.
The risk is too great.
Is that yours?
A man's worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is.

That might not be a good idea.
Whose umbrella is this?
Come on everyone, let's dance!
I'd better go.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.

Trains come more often than buses.
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.

I asked her out on a date.
None of my classmates live near here.

I bought this racket two months ago.
Tell us about your family.
What do you do on Sunday?
They furnished the library with many books.
The store might be closed already.
I watched the movie.
I was looking forward to this.
Take your hand out of your pocket.
It's hard to master English.
We have to make sure they're ready.
Is there any difference between your idea and hers?
We didn't have many visitors this summer.
Tom stopped Mary.
Do you have any one dollar bills?
He was outraged.
I heard that she came here.
We're all in agreement.
Tom is upstairs in his bedroom.
I could've done that by myself.
Everybody is focused.
They found no such proof.
What kind of girl are you?
I know they'll all want to help you.
He opened the cages.
Tom got on the airplane.
Come downstairs as soon as possible.
Could you put a little sunscreen on my back?
This is lame.

Just tell me what happened.

You can't come tomorrow.
People will talk.
Tom was wearing a brown coat.
I'll kill you.
Why don't you put some clothes on?
I want to talk to you about this list.
I'm lazy.
I'm color-blind.
He doesn't come here every day.
Do you have a bottle opener I could use?
This report is badly written and is full of mistakes.
There is no need to be frightened. He won't harm you.
Tom said he saw Mary get into John's car.
I don't really want to go there by myself.
Don't forget to tell Tom.
He inherited the house.
She nodded her head in agreement.
Try not to panic.
I wasn't hired.
You know I can't wait for you if you're late.
The best place to hide something is in plain sight.
The room will be painted tomorrow.
That really isn't funny.

I can't play tennis as well as Tom.
We weren't happy.
Since there are usually multiple websites on any given topic, I usually just click the back button when I arrive on any webpage that has pop-up advertising. I just go to the next page found by Google and hope for something less irritating.
Greed is not always good.
That young lady is a nurse.
I'll catch the next plane.
It's our fault.
He repaired his watch by himself.
I got upset.
We haven't been able to get much help.
Don't mock me.
That seems like a lot.
We won't have much time.
Tom sang better than Mary did.
You need to get out of the house more.
He is incompetent.

Tell me how you solved the problem.
Do you want some of this?
Would you like another glass of wine?
Cigarette smoke bothers me a lot.
I'm impressed with your French.
I came upon a rare stamp at that store.
We have a parking lot for the customers.
He seems to be rich now.
Who goes there?
We agreed to the plan.
It's possible that they'll go to the supermarket today.
Don't forget that.
Calm down!
Wipe your face clean.
You know too much.
We waited.
Cats were domesticated by the Egyptians.
Fashions change quickly.
Somebody tipped off the gang members to the police surveillance.
The baby screamed all night.
Now it's time for the weather forecast.
Some kinds of birds can't fly.
He made his parents happy.
I'm glad I invited you.

I am not romantic at all.
Where did you learn that?
You shouldn't have done that.
You don't need luck.
Did you talk about your hobby?
My father is a heavy smoker.
This CD belongs to her.
I wish you hadn't done that.
I know lots of songs.
They finished their meal.
Do you want to watch this movie again?
She tried in vain to please him.
He started to speak English.
He told me just the opposite!
Why don't you give us a moment to talk?
What time does your watch say it is now?
You better hurry.
Now let's begin the game.
Why's everybody so quiet?
He has a very expensive watch.
A dog was running.
I saw him.
It was a warm summer night.
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him.
The soldiers had more powerful weapons.
I thought you'd got lost.
Didn't you read the manual?
In addition to English, she speaks French fluently.
We're going to another party after this one.
I think it's time for me to start taking my responsibilities seriously.
My mother can't ride a bicycle.
The day we arrived was a holiday.
You don't want this, do you?
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
The hotel we stayed at last summer is near the lake.
That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
Do you understand what I am saying?
I thought you were serious.
Trust me.
Would you consider marrying me?
I'm not good at fishing.
Go to bed.
Do you mind if I help myself?
The baby's fine.
The sky is clear and the sun is bright.
I'm proud of my children.
We shouldn't stay here.
Don't disturb me.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
Bring the key.
I've never been to my uncle's house.
Let's do it now.
It's a common mistake.
Do ghosts really exist?
Leave that to me.
We should ban advertising aimed towards children.
He forgot his promise to go there.

My dream is to become a pilot.
What do you remember?
He turned Christian.
This proverb is worth remembering.
Are you a member of this crew?
Air the futon.
How much time did you spend doing research before you started writing?
You should get your hair cut.
We lost.
We love our parks.
I'm considering going with them.
I advise you to change clothes.
How's married life going?
His fake moustache started to peel off on one side.
Nothing ever makes him angry.
It's possible that Tom lied to you.
This is not good.
I remember seeing you before.
We were right.
You see what I mean?
We love picnics.
I talked to Tom this morning just before the meeting.
Tom wanted to say goodbye to Mary.
They accused me of being a liar.
I want Tom to come back.
The hotel is run by his uncle.
Let's divide the work equally.
That day will go down in history.
Excuse me for interrupting you, but would you mind opening the window?
Am I in trouble financially?
Are you honest?
I had my eyes checked.
At the best hotels, there is always someone at your beck and call.
May I ask where you work?
There are too many ads on YouTube.
What did you do that for?
Are you sure you're up for it?
I bought this book at Maruzen Bookstore.
This book is too expensive.
They painted the window frames yellow.
I hope you enjoyed your trip.
I don't know the password.
We talked about time zones.
I don't want to hear another word about it!
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other.
Tom and Mary worked out their problems.
No one's going to save you now.
I pay most of my bills on the first of each month.
He shares a room.
I felt like going out for a walk.
You have not changed at all.
The garden was surrounded by a wooden fence.
It's not much of a surprise, is it?
I'll look after your child while you are away.
You might be interested in this.
He's not very good at it.
Tom is always working.
Let's turn back.
He wants that a lot.
I have the minutes of the meeting.
You are a good customer.
How am I supposed to dress?
One of the children is studying, but the others are playing.
I just kept my mouth shut.
The mechanic fixed my car without charging me a dime.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
They walked down the street singing a song.
You can go if you want to.
She kissed my cheek.
I'm sure there's another way out.
It's really bad.
What happened next?
I hate taking risks.
It's redundant.
I called the police.
Don't let this chance slip by.
Tom thought Mary could speak French.
I try to be aggressive.
We need action, not words.
Medical marijuana is legal in this state.
Our passports were all we needed.
I'm not good at classifying things.
I expected more.
His dog barks at me.
My doctor has advised me to stop taking this medicine.
Once you begin, you must continue.
We appreciate your kind advice.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
I liked that book.
I don't care what you thought.
It's only blood.
You're lucky you didn't die.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
Tom passed away quite suddenly.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
No matter how busy Tom gets, he never forgets to write an email to his mother at least once a week.
Please follow the nurse's directions.
His wife seems to be a foreigner.
It is Tom's ambition to go to the moon.
Tom hurried out of the building.
I'll help you pack.
I'd do anything to protect you.
You've got the wrong number.
I'm very pleased with your work.
Would you like that?
We're safe now.
Give someone else a chance.
I only have butter in my refrigerator.
Somebody has left his hat.
We almost left.
Let's check the map.
You seem confident.
The balloon is filled with air.
You're wasting water.
How much am I paying you?
I was beginning to worry about you.
Tom knew that Mary was rich.
I am very tired from the hard work.
Did you see the show?
He does everything very quickly.
I have a pretty tight schedule today.
I have no hesitation in telling the truth.
I look forward to seeing you on my next trip to your city.
He doesn't show his true feelings.
They will be safe with me.
It was a waste time for all of us.
I want you to sleep on it.
Could you move just a little closer?
He walked along the shore.
There they go again.
Please do something about it.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
I detest hypocrisy.
That made me very sad.
I'm tired of listening to your bragging.
I opened the door slowly.
I love this song.
I didn't know you were expecting anyone.
She didn't give me back my money.
What do you have in mind?
Let me get you some ice.
It was a judgment call.
I thought it would be fun.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
I spent all my money on stupid stuff.
I need it for the parking meter.
Where is this train going?
He tried several times, but failed.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
That was a big mistake, wasn't it?
He turned his back on the old traditions.
You should get your eyes checked.
Are you from around here?
Nobody is paying attention to Tom.
You're in pain, aren't you?
How big you are!
I felt awful.
The crocodile trapped the gnu as it tried to cross the river.
She wanted him to stay longer.
He swims better than I do.
It's really bright.
I would rather go out.
We got to be friends.
Do you feel sick?
I'm a stranger here.
I have been wearing this overcoat for more than five years.
It is me that is wrong.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
He wants red glasses.
I get anything I want.
He cried out for help in a loud voice.
I thought for a minute we had a problem.
Are you sure that you want to quit your job?
The bar was so smoky that my eyes started to sting.
Can you please pass me the newspaper?
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
She's very upset.
He bribed that politician with a great deal of money.
I never had to worry about money.
Aren't we lucky?
With the coming of spring, everything is gradually coming to life again.
No one can do that.
Is she your mother?
I think that it's too big.
That tie suits you very well.
I hate that you have to leave.
The slippery snake slithered right out of his hand.
Leave out this word.
They want you dead.
What do you do on Fridays?
It happened very fast.
I love old books.
I thought you were injured.
The girl got distracted and lost sight of her parents.
This is for my friend.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
Why did you keep that a secret?
I don't like to take on such heavy responsibilities.
Several cottages have been isolated by the flood water.
What should I wear?
She's older than Tom.
Her car is two years old.
Tom has never asked me for money.
She worships him and the ground he walks on.
You're preaching to the choir.
He felt in his pocket for his lighter.
Keep an eye on him.
No matter how he tried, he could not open the door.
She worked from morning till night.
Do you feel lucky?
Tom usually goes to school by bus.
I didn't get any of that.
I'm broke and tired.
Tom'll quit.
Come sit with us.
Some were unwilling to fight.
How do you know they're looking for us?
We thought you could do it.
When I was feeding my dog, I noticed that the gate had been left open.
What would you like for breakfast?
He had ambition.
Tom certainly doesn't need any more money.
Let me handle this.
You took advantage of me.
I felt naked.
Can it wait another hour?
That will cost you a lot of money.
Do you remember anything else?
Don't wait up for me.
You're invited.
She had a perfect alibi.
All I want is for you to be happy.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
He regained consciousness and was able to talk.
Can the rumor be true?
You're losing.
He didn't think it was funny.
Are you still asking yourself what the meaning of life is?
Tom is three years older than you.
My mother is an early riser.
We saw a stranger walking outside.
Did they talk to each other?
She asked him for some money.
You should not sleep.
I'm not patient.
He turned off the light.
I'm really disappointed.
I have enough money to buy it.
Next time it will be my turn to drive.
How did you find me?
I don't like the beach.
He supports the Democratic Party.
I ought to do this by myself.
I feel like taking a day off tomorrow.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
We're getting married.
He often quotes Milton.
I want you to call it off.
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
Did I ask you?
Tom said he saw something suspicious the morning Mary died.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
I like taking walks in the woods.
My mother made me a sweater.
I'm feeling much better today.
She gave me a doll.
The Battle for Belleau Wood lasted three weeks.
Tom is wearing a strange-looking hat.
I'm happy, too.
I don't like to swim in the pool.
I was right on the spot when it happened.
They weren't at home yesterday.
Give me another example.
I'm going to see Tom.
Try as hard as you can.
I've removed the comma.
Tom disagrees with Mary on that matter.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Let it be.
I've enjoyed my stay.
I saw Tom standing there.
Don't burn yourself.
The police searched the premises thoroughly.
This is the best tasting pear I've ever eaten.
He thoughtfully gave me a helping hand.
Their answer is no.
Does that surprise you?
Why can't you come?
I'm going through my closet to find clothes to give to charity.
I'm glad you came over.
We're going to try.

Don't be deceived by appearances.
She begged him to stay.
My cat will love this.

Run for it!
Please let me pick up your sister at the station.
Did I say it wrong?
Don't open your book.
She drowned herself in some lake.
I can't spend money I don't have.
I'd like to see your warrant.
I got tired of lying in bed all day.
Tom did something very stupid.
We all care for one another.
He's nervous and gets scared easily.
The tree's roots extend deep into the earth.
It's cool today.
Have you ever ridden a mule?

However hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can.
Do you really think that?
I'd rather do this by myself.
He is well liked by his students.
Do you have a ticket?
He's Swiss.
I'm in luck.

I'll take over.
He explained it at length.
Have you been told where to park your car?
What month is this?
Anyone can do their bit to protect the environment.
Does she come from the agency that sent the last temporary I had?
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
Please find a solution to the problem.
It seems like an interesting job. What do you exactly do?
It is human nature to be bugged by such things.
She knit him a sweater.
Show him how to do this.
She had tears in her eyes.
Meeting my old friend was very pleasant.
I don't have that kind of money.
You don't want to do anything rash.

I have feeling in my legs.
As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but sand.
One of the girls was left behind.
The man answers the description.
You're crazy.
I don't feel like studying English today.
I didn't notice him go out.
Who can tell me how a light bulb works?
Did you reserve a room at the hotel?
I like you very much.
Tom got permission to go home early.
Who wrote the book?
This should be done as soon as possible.
My English teacher recommended that I read these books.
It was extremely cold.
I eat with my hands.
It's awfully cold today.
There's another meaning, too.
There're no lights.
Open the door, please.
It is extraordinarily hot today.
Tom doesn't live with his wife anymore.
I feel a little woozy.
She lives in this neighborhood.
What are we doing?
We should set a trap.
You lied to us, didn't you?
What are you inferring?
They don't speak Spanish.
Be nicer to your brother.
Are we prepared?
I'm expecting a customer today.
I picked you some flowers.
I'll just have one drink.
He speaks ten languages.
We walked ten miles that day.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
The whole company stood in silence for a few moments, as a tribute to the dead.
I have only just begun.
I suppose you want me to pay for this.
Are you telling this story or am I?
It has to be done.
You're always criticizing me!
The weather changed suddenly.
The rumor can't be true.
Your death will not have been in vain.
I'm thirty years older than you.
What brand of dog food do you feed your dog?
Check, please.
Nobody trusts Tom anymore.
You had better go to the dentist.
I got busy.
I feel a lot better than before.
The baby is sleeping.
I don't think everyone gave up.
I think it's unlikely that the next model will be any better than this one.
He saw everything.
Mary decided never to see him any more.
He probably forgot about it.

I'm chubby.
I can't put up with that noise.
I have to win.
How do you know how deep the lake is?
We easily figured out the password.
Why don't you stick around for a few minutes?
I fell down and hurt my wrist.
He earns 300,000 yen a month.
Don't you think so?
Are you sure you want to leave now?
Tom is John's older brother.
I don't know why I just did that.
You must realize that by now.
They don't despise you.
It was probably not true.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
What am I supposed to do with what you gave me?
The ice melted into a puddle of water.
Keep the door open.
I know the whole of the story.
Tom won't tell us what he knows.
Tom forced me to go.
War doesn't make anybody happy.
I know your roommate.
Her oldest son is not married.
The soup is cold.
I'll assist you.
That's what I was thinking.
I will never have a daughter.
Tom didn't make a sound.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
I don't think I can do it.
Tom is all alone.
We all want you back.
How do you remember that?
I've been feeling this way all day.
Where did you go for spring break?
Tom doesn't remember my name.
Did you hear it too?
Has he arrived already?
I want to make sure nothing's broken.
What would you like to be called?
He kept his word.
What were you two doing there anyway?
You're very upset.
You're not dead.
Criminals should go to jail.
Try to hold it together.
I think you are the one who broke it.
Tom is there.
It makes me so happy.
I am doing my homework.
You found something they didn't.
I don't know what this word means. I'll look it up in the dictionary.
Prices dropped suddenly.
You can't do this to us.
I have some extra tickets for the concert.
He liked that.
Are you in Boston?
I should've called a doctor.
Tom didn't attend today's meeting.
Where did you find it, at school or at home?
Watch yourself.
The job of a driver is not as easy as it looks.

I think you'd better go.
I applaud your decision to study medicine.
Tell me you're not serious!
It seems like it might rain this afternoon.
Can you fix a toilet?
That works.
You're very rude.
That's what you've always wanted.
This is what'll happen.
He can't cook very well.
It's unforgettable.
Tom and John are brothers.
This is too long.
We want to make a simple change.
I'll explain later.
Is this your wine?
He caused his parents a lot of anxiety.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
We're honeymooning.
I'm getting tired of your complaints.
Watching movies is very interesting.
I don't have any pencils.
Do you know who they are?
Does he live here?
It's as much an art as a science.
Tom looks exceptionally bored.
She began crying.
He did it in front of the staff.
I was humiliated.
Death is inevitable.
I don't deserve to be this happy.
The garden is in front of the house.
I love Christmas music.
The police have few clues to go on in this case.
It's not what you wear, it's how you wear it.
Do you miss it?
I know Tom was disappointed.
Please give me a dozen cream puffs.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
The tree stopped growing.
That was amazing.
You're stupid.
I didn't ask you to do that.
You could hear a pin drop.
My brother became an engineer.
I'm planning to stay at the Hillside Hotel.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
Come with me now.
Because of the bad weather, I didn't go.
I hope we didn't wake you.
I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
They're mine.
A bow is no use without arrows.
I made two.
We'll never go back there again.
Who do you live with?
He has no hope of getting ahead.
The mother is looking for a babysitter.
She was on the verge of crying.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
We all work too hard.
Why don't I call you?
This movie is rated PG-13.
Why don't you stay a while?
My wife had a baby last week.
I don't want to sleep.
Be careful on your way back home.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I read the New York Times.
I think you should see this.
Place it wherever you like.
He differs from his brother.
Let me help you clear the table.
The people protested against the low altitude flight training.
Lock the door.
My wife's trying to sleep.
I've made my choice.
Stop staring at me like that.
He spoke highly of you.
Tom felt his knees tremble.
I wonder what it is like to travel through space.
It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
He often plays piano.
He will be back in an hour.
I'm firing you.
The market is big.
She availed herself of every opportunity to improve her English.
Will you open the door?
That dog tries to eat just about anything he lays his eyes on.
I bet you didn't know that.
I was able to knit.
That's not important right now.
The old man was starved to death.
I have other plans for you.
Mary is easy-going and fun.
Have you already finished?
The air was full of flying bullets.
The bike screeched to a stop.
It's hard to choose.
The time has come for you to play your trump card.
He was terribly poor when he was young.
I make my own rules.
That's all I can ask.
Is that love?
I want to apologize for everything I said.
You don't seem too sure.
It would be perfect.
I'm getting too old for this.
Have a nice trip!
I'm cultured.
You're very stylish.
I don't support his ideas.
We're not happy.
I think that's wise.
They were even more interested in his beautiful wife.
The car ran into a guardrail.
Do you like this garden?
The best thing about working in a team is that, when something goes wrong, you can always blame someone else.
No one is home.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
A holiday this summer is out of the question.
He will get his job back at the next election.
Do you mind if I turn on the TV?

He made no response.
Are you out of your mind?
You've got to be bold!

I told you everything I knew.
I hate hypocrisy.
You should look that word up.
Switzerland is a beautiful country.
Tom doesn't need me.
Tom was always there for me.
I feel empowered.
Love is everything.
They deserved it.
Did you ask the price?
I like her very much.
If the weather clears up, we'll go for a walk in the forest.
I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.
She has done her homework.
It was his silence that made her angry.
I can't eat or drink very hot things.
I don't know your name.
I can squeeze you in.
I'm just kidding.
Are they friends?
Have you ever been hypnotized?
Mary is my niece.
Everything will be perfect.
I had stage fright at first, but I got over it quickly.
That's why I was late.
You thought I wouldn't come tonight, didn't you?
He is just my age.
We share the housework.
I hear that his father is abroad.
How do you spell your family name?
Both his father and mother are dead.
Don't make a fuss.
I climbed in through the window.
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
Whose side are you on?
I had to keep my secret.
The man blushed.
The boss is very upset.
Buying such an expensive car is out of the question.
How old were you when you got married?
He's too old for you.
Don't talk about my family.
The climate here is mild.
Why do you like it?
Is it dangerous?
I can't live without him.
I'll leave.
I lost my camera.
Can Tom see us?
They decided on the date and location of their wedding.
We know it works.
I want these.
He called at my house.
She spends time with her grandmother every Sunday.
Cleveland was not sure the boy was his son.
I found your slippers under the bed.
Why does Tom want to hurt me?
Leave us.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
Tom will never agree to that.
The pain has mostly gone away.
You can't handle this alone.
The salesgirl couldn't open the cash register.
She told him to study.
I'm auditioning for the part.
Tom doesn't know Mary is in Boston.
I predicted it.
I looked around hoping to spot a friendly face.
I thought you'd be different.
It's your bedtime.
I'm ready if you are.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
I'm so happy for you, Tom.
I support you a hundred percent.
We have plenty of time to spare.
She seems happy to be here.
Tom must've been imagining things.
Please say yes.
You don't have to get up so early.
Tom had no idea how to do it.
Alcohol consumption is higher in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe.
They combined forces to fight the enemy.
I know that things haven't been easy for you.

Do you think I want to die?
I can't finish the job in such a short time.
I'm here to apologize.
Tom lost his favorite toy.
There was a cottage on the side of the hill.
Can you give him first aid?
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
The teacher wrote something on the blackboard, but it was too small for me to read.
Your son must be quite tall by now.
They fought until the end.
They smiled at each other.
Are you flirting with me?
I went snorkeling in a beautiful coral reef.
Please don't forget to put stamps on the letters that I gave you to mail.
You caught me off-guard.
She is unconscious.
When the curtain went up, the stage was dark.
I told you I hate that shirt.
It rained so hard that we decided to visit him some other time.
How long have you been studying English?
Her new novel has become a best seller.
Even if she comes to see me, tell her I am not at home.
He was busy with his homework.
Do you mean to tell me you can't find one?
This is a surprising discovery.
Let me do the cooking.
Tom likes skiing, too.
I had a late breakfast.
In terms of the pay you will get, is this a good job?
She is knitting a sweater.
Can you make yourself understood in French?
I'm not minimizing the consequences.
It wasn't him.
He showed me a lot of beautiful photos.
None of this makes any sense.
How many people were present at the meeting?
I'm used to the noise.
They had no beards, no hair and no eyebrows.
I wanted to have a beer with you.
He likes tea.
My aunt grows tomatoes in her garden.
I stayed at a nice hotel.
Honesty is the primary reason for his success.
I hope to see you again before long.
Don't underestimate your own strength.
You're single.
There is little hope that she will come on time.
Why can't you take things just as they are?
I got a traffic ticket.
She dog-eared the page and set the book aside.
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.
My glass is full.
It'll definitely rain.
Would you join me for a walk?
Get away from me.
Subtlety never was your strong suit.
Do you want to sit down?
Don't pick your nose.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Can I get you anything?
Where's your daughter?
That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
As time passed, the radioactivity diminished.
I know where the blame goes.
No one knows what to say.
The Japanese economy is in depression.
Tom unfolded his napkin.
Slavery is a crime against humanity.
I don't care what you do.
Nothing was funny.
We have a lot of great guys on our team.
I had the boy carry my bag.
Are you Chinese?
There's something under the bed.
I want to talk to you about tomorrow.
I'm sorry, that flight is full.
Human beings, whether they realise it or not, continually seek happiness.
We all understand.

Correct the errors if there are any.
You are blinded by love.
The prince was changed into a tree by magic.
Why are you acting this way?
Do you like white chocolate?
This story is too predictable.
His record will never be broken.
Do you want to see my cat?
I'm really embarrassed.
I want you back today.
I can't tell you all my secrets.
You don't have to come see me.
It was nice of you to show up.
Who plays the keyboards in your band?
Is that your umbrella?
The police caught him at it.
I can't show you.
I actually had fun tonight.
I am Korean.
I want what you want.
Pass the sugar, please.
I don't know how you did it.
We're alone.
Tom didn't listen to what I said.
You don't even know how.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
It's starting to cool off.
Do you share a room?
He saw it also.
I will teach you how to play chess.
I will be back soon.
We feed our dog three times a day.
Will you try this on for me?
It's a great day for a hike.
They arrived here safely yesterday.
He tried with all his might to push the door open.
I'm crazy about you.
Tom needs to do that now.
You're not my friend anymore.
I don't like your suggestion.
Can you read that?
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him.
Education is the key to success.
I can swim as well as you.
I must answer her letter.
I don't know what I've been so afraid of.
Don't come to me with any excuses.
Don't ask questions that you don't want to know the answer to.
I don't talk like that.
There are no exceptions to this rule.
It's your duty to vote.
He attempted suicide.
Don't put anything on top of the box.
I had a good time last evening.
The older children helped the younger ones.
Short hair really suits her.
What were you two doing there anyway?
I can hardly make out what he says.
I'm going to call the police.
Please give him a call.
We have no water.
Aren't you too young to smoke?
I don't know how long.
I will be in high school next April.
There is no doubt about his ability.
You should stop.
I have a cut here.
Turn to the right.
He had a kind word and a pleasant smile for everyone.
What's wrong with your eyes?
He speaks English fluently.
Please choose one person.
I'm sorry about last night.
I knew what was going to happen.
Don't you think that's strange?
Neither one of them disagrees.
He is respected by them.
Do you sometimes study in the library?
There are no secrets between us.
I hear something.
I have completely recovered.
I am a Muslim.
Her son is a mama's boy. He has to be with her all the time.
You're out of sugar.
It could have been me.
I'd die without you.
Your telephone's ringing, Tom.
Every student was asked one question.
He came to Japan two years ago.
He didn't tell me everything.
I want you to beg for mercy.
He has never been scolded by his father.
Hurry up, girls.
I don't know where it came from.
He is away on holiday.
He pulled open the door.
I like all of them.
Look at all these flowers.
Why didn't you read the magazine?
I plan to go to France next year.
This piece of music is way too difficult for me to play.
I don't want you to be upset.
I was asked to umpire the game.
You seem upset.
You're very sharp.
That's what I usually do.
I had to get away from here.
They might pay me more if I could use a computer.
I have two questions for you.
I have never seen anyone like you.
No matter where I go, I get lost.
How do you stop this?
You got what you wanted, didn't you?
You won't believe this.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
I don't see a problem with this.
I told him, once for all, that I would not marry him.
Is that your mother?
My neighbor's son made fun of my daughter today at school.
This is a difficult problem to solve.
"How soon will the bus come?" "In five minutes."
He cannot have said so.
I know they'll all want to help you.
The boy lay listening to the radio.
I have a runny nose.
Give me another cup of tea.
Do you think it was Tom who did that?
That was kind of rude.
Take a little nap on the couch.
I want your name and badge number.
She was ashamed of herself for her carelessness.
She advised him not to go there by himself.
One million people lost their lives in the war.
You don't seem convinced.
It goes without saying that nobody can come between us.
We had an unpleasant experience there.
How long are you going to stay in Japan?
Are you still around?
I am used to living alone.
Does that surprise you?
Let's do this.
I saw Yoshida for the first time in five years.
Get out of my house.
Are you doing anything special this evening?
We would often talk about our future.
Don't just take my word for it.
I want the other one.
No one could deny this.
She makes him do his homework before dinner.
I'm a new student.
Tom is vulgar.
I'm surprised to see you.
How many of your students are here?
They opened the door.
Tom spoke.
Are you bringing anyone?
Let's do the dishes.
We have no hot water because the pipes broke.
I'm catching on.
He wants to reach a wider audience.
I should go home before my parents start to worry.
Where did he find the money?
These politicians are corrupt.
You have my word.
He demanded that we leave at once.
He was the envy of his friends.
It was not an accident.
The plate is made of plastic.
He is eager to go there.
It's gotten better.
Tom is listening to music.
This is your fault.
I turned right.
Some of them have committed suicide.
Is something bothering you, Tom?
They're mad at you.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
He studied very hard.
I hope you won't be disappointed.
They were surprised by what they saw.
You aren't replaceable.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
Do you know what this is called?
Does it matter?
He's got the new technique down pat.
That's what I was trying to do.
I think you ought to postpone the meeting.
It was the best party ever.
Tom punched John in the stomach.
I want to be more independent.
Where are your suitcases?
Turn the flame down low.
As far as I know, I'm in perfect health.
I want to make amends for my behavior.
He did all the legwork.
I'll have to confiscate your knife.
I don't know any more than you do.
Do they know about us?
Tom is on the roof.
Put the luggage somewhere.
Wherever you may go, you'll be welcomed.
Fill in this form.
Trim the fat off the meat.
I go for a walk every day, except when it rains.
Tom wanted to play chess.
It is rare for him to get angry.
You're very timid.
I really don't want to go out on a date with Mary.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I will go and take a look at the house.
Why are you standing there?
She gave birth to a baby boy.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke.
Should I cancel the call?
See you soon!
You'd better not go.
We're not all teachers.
Do you want to be rich?
Can I have the sugar, please?
It fell short of my expectation.
I have plenty of time.
You'll ruin everything.
Is this pen yours?
I was caught in the rain on my way home.
We're going north.
He suggested that I accompany him to the party.
You've been warned.
For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
He turned out to be nothing but a liar.
She asked him to call her later, but he forgot to.
I just opened it.
Look and see how much the cash register rings up.
I can see it in your eyes.
I was absolutely right.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
Tom has a point here.
That makes no difference.
I'm getting off at the next station.
It's different.
I had a really great time with your family.
The road curves gently towards the west.
They have their own troubles.
You're early.
These are the originals.
You don't know what it is, do you?
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
Everybody needs help sometimes.
There is strength in numbers.
The road was very bumpy.
Did anybody notice this?
She forced him to sit down.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
Once he had written the letter, he sent it.
I'm fascinated.
Everyone seems to agree.
Tom and Mary insult each other all the time.
I don't want you to be upset.
Having seen him before, I knew him at once.
Are you mad?
I do it because I enjoy it.
He is still having doubts.
Count up to thirty.
You should make up your own mind.
Which way did you choose?
Your brother wasn't at school today.
I'm at your mercy.
His story was published in a magazine.
You must teach me what you know.
I just wanted to let you know I have a date.
I have a letter written by him.
The US is trying to extradite a drug lord from Mexico.
I don't like his taste in color.
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
Can you read this kanji?
Why don't you go on a diet?
No one can tell.
Do whatever he tells you.
The floorboards creak a bit when you walk across them.
Go to the hospital.
Don't scream, or I'll scream louder.
That nurse is very kind and polite.
We pitched the tent next to the river.
You must be very special.
If you want my help, you'll have to ask for it.
I just wanted to talk.
I gave you fair warning.
I don't care what you do with it.
At last, he solved the problem.
Some things are better left unsaid.
I go for a walk every other day.
You'd better not swim if you've just eaten.
I opened the window to let in some fresh air.
I don't think I can eat this.
I think jogging is good exercise.
He looks pale.
Have you finished?
I felt fear.
It's against the law.
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
How many times did you see the movie?
I was threatened.
Feel this.
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
He is just a kid.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
Karima hasn't read the letter yet.
You're good.
You can tell what a person is like by looking at his friends.
Oil will float on water.
What's my room number?
He will regret his own words.
I am going to Europe next week.
We had to make the best of a bad deal.
Why did you come here today?
When is good for you?
I have a lot to do today.
She burst out laughing when she saw me.
They meet once a week.
Could you pass me the salt, please?
Were you one of them?
Tom remembers you.
He was born in Ohio.
If it snows on the mountain, it is cold in the valley.
Do you have a copy?
We're the last.
To tell the truth, I don't like what you're wearing.
Who was sitting here?
You were great today.
Psychology deals with human emotions.
I only read the first three chapters.
You're very emotional.
Don't judge others by the color of their skin.
She's well known as a singer.
I also went there.
Are you sure they can do this?
I appreciate the sentiment.
What more is there to know?
Don't just stand there.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
The plumber pumped the water out of the pipe.
Smoking does you more harm than good.
I think Tom can help.
Hold on tight, otherwise you will fall off.
Park the car in the shade.
I still do that.
Do you follow?
She can speak French.
You're grown up now.
I know how this works.
I spent all morning chopping wood.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
Are you out of your mind?
I would like to go to Russia sometime.
I hear that even taxi drivers often get lost in Tokyo.
You can take it.
He lost sight of his friend in the crowd.
As far as the eye could reach, nothing was to be seen but sand.
I'm a farmer.
Your hair is too long.
I made a few modifications.
He resigned as president.
I really should be going.
He has a test next week.
What makes you think I won't be able to do it?
I sat down next to him.
I don't need that kind of pressure.
He took a step forward.
Americans like football in the same way that Japanese like baseball.
What are you frightened of?
I have good eyesight.
You can't be serious.
You had better read a lot of books while you are young.
Are you here alone?
I'm sure she will turn up soon.
We all want to be desired.
Tom didn't know where Mary wanted to spend her summer vacation.
I'm glad you decided to come.
It will soon be September.
I had a nightmare about vampires.
You'd better not go today.
We left immediately.
Life is enjoyable.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Are you a ghost?
She is working hard this semester.
Why would you do that without telling us?
She explained to him why she was late for his party.
Not everyone agrees with you.
This dog will protect us.
I've made up my mind to go.
Tom teaches us French.
The garden needs to be weeded.
Perfect!
He could not go to college.
Next week a family will move in.
In my opinion, you're wrong.
I need lots of time.
The sky grew darker and darker.
Are you the manager?
Bears hibernate during the winter.
We're not serious.
When did you become a teacher?
I was discredited.
Can you speak English?
I should have gone to bed earlier last night.
She looked at him angrily.
The president's son leads the special forces.
That house is small, but it's big enough for us.
I'm not ashamed that I am poor.
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
My doctor advised me to give up smoking.
Read this.
You're very understanding.
She panicked when she heard the news.
This school was founded in 1970.
I felt bad.
You can eat whatever you like.
I made up my mind to go there.
I just don't get it.
What's your name again?
He never seems to grow older.
Tom bolted the door.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I never dreamed that I would meet her again.
Don't stay up all night.
He was reading a newspaper.
Don't tell my wife.
I hope I will become a dentist in the future.
Tom was humiliated.
I have an announcement.
Do you eat at home or eat out?
We got all the materials together.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
Am I interrupting something here?
That's hardly believable.
Don't make me stay.
Mother prepared us lunch.
You're big.
"Is she young?" "Yes, she is."
Is there any difference between your idea and hers?
Can I see you at ten tomorrow?
This isn't supposed to be happening.
She is particular about what she wears.
I have something very important to tell you.
I don't know which button to push.
She has a large mansion.
Don't be fresh to me.
Isn't there anything that will make you feel better?
Don't intrude on her privacy.
Tom is a student.
Don't translate English into Japanese word for word.
I'm not old enough.
Your parents are cool.
I will do anything for you.
You can't do this alone.
Solve the problem.
Could I get one more beer, please?
Are you doing what you think is right?
I played tennis yesterday for the first time.
I prefer that it stay that way.
Why didn't you just leave?
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
This is outrageous.
That's not my favorite topic.
When her husband died, she felt like killing herself.
I've got two books.
I think you did it.
Exercise is good for your health.
Let Tom decide.
I couldn't bring myself to throw your picture away.
The dog pursued a rabbit into the forest.
I don't want meat.
It sickens me.
Tom loves being outdoors.
This room is too big.
We will reach London before dark.
What time will you leave?
The objection is overruled.
He woke up in the middle of the night.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
It's terrifying.
What's this dog's name?
Let's get out for a while to take a walk.
That is our baseball field.
He listened to my opinion.
I'll see you again this afternoon.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
You can't leave me.
Will you look after my baggage?
Tom didn't commit the crimes he's been accused of.
Can you lift this stone?
The people are friendly here.
I could do that for you.
I'd like an 80-yen stamp, please.
I wasn't done.
I was surprised by what I learned.
We're in danger.
Dr. Smith has a lot of patients.
What's that stain?
I was devastated.
One day you'll be able to walk.
I have at least ten books.
These jewels are expensive.
The boat capsized.
The drug problem is international.
I wish you had come with us.
I love to eat cakes.
The administration makes important decisions.
I thought so.
She advised him where to stay.
I thought you'd say that.
According to the newspaper, it's going to rain today.
No merchandise can be returned.
We hope this never happens again.
Stop beating around the bush.
Please don't tell my wife.
We're ashamed.
The government has imposed a new tax on wine.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner.
Those pictures were painted by him.
You'll ask Tom, won't you?
He hasn't done anything.
The woman is taking notes.
Be content.
It's going to get ugly.
Did I say something stupid?
Did you get your receipt?
Drop it!
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Don't be crude.
I want you to run to the store for me.
How can you even ask that question?
Do not come here.
This law applies to everybody.
This book is new.
You're with friends.
A man who smacks his wife around is contemptible.
Tom goes to the barber less than four times a year.
He opened the window to let in some fresh air.
Tom doesn't want to move.
I think you dropped this.
I got a call from her this morning.
The party's over.
Do not turn off your computer.
Nobody can hear you.
Write your name in capitals.
Did you get any sleep at all last night?
Is this the right thing to do?
You make me laugh a lot.
Our company supports several cultural events.
We set up our tents before dark.
Think before you speak.
She sometimes has her mother cut her hair.
Is he done using the telephone?
I want to thank you for all you've done.
You're a prude.
She's better at it than I am.
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
Tom had bruises all over his body after the fight.
You won't be the first.
They were sunbathing on the beach.
You've got the wrong person.
Tom asked Mary why she had done that.
It's starting to get cold here.
He was playing football with an empty can.
Fear is essential for survival.
Did I tell you about my party this Friday?
Are you seriously thinking about pursuing a career as a race car driver?
The child had no overcoat on although it was very cold.
I waited for him for an hour.
I'm impulsive.
France is to the south of England.
I love to party.
They agreed to work together.
Tom slept on the train.
Either you or he has to attend the meeting.
Hold the box with both hands.
They're cops.
Look at that big dog.
Listen to this!
We're being used.
I left.
Tell Tom what you mean.
Do you mind if I park here?
Come on.
Send for a doctor at once.
When I bite down, this tooth hurts.
It doesn't have to be like this.
I'm no rebel.
After the storm, the sea was calm.
I was wrongfully punished.
I felt left out.
I'll be ready in a few minutes.
I have something else in mind.
What are you hinting at?
I want you to have this.
All we can do is hope.
He replied that he did not know.
How do you do it?
You must take his age into account.
He became more and more famous as a critic.
You have too many books on the shelf.
Is there somebody sitting in this seat here?
I'd like to speak with Tom in private for a moment.
He's a foreign exchange student.
I have to support a large family.
He seems to make nothing of it.
Your dress is unsuitable for the occasion.
Their habitat is threatened by deforestation.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
Do you want some help?
She is buying books in the bookstore.
You're over-analyzing.
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
Tom is having lunch.
We need to get something done.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I really have nothing else to say.
Have you all gone mad?
Put on your hat.
You're preaching to the choir.
I don't know where you are now.
I haven't gotten rid of my bad cold yet.
Are you accusing me of something?
You're scaring the kids.
They don't know my name.
This is his fault.
They're here.
I didn't recognize him at first on the train.
I think you'd better leave.
As far as I know, he's a diligent student.
We got lost in the fog.
It's very easy to use.
She kissed him on the cheek.
Where do I sleep?
Time is running out.
This is very good.
The mailman emptied the mailbox.
You're sneaky.
It's on the sofa.
It's way past your bedtime.
It's a nice place, but I wouldn't live there.
I visited Boston.
She went shopping.
Go away before they see you here.
If you pass this test, you could graduate next month.
Let's do it another time.
We're as good as dead now.
Please give me a glass of water.
The place is surrounded by cops.
I admire your confidence.
What does that even mean?
No one has anything.
Lincoln was elected President in 1860.
Did Tom like Boston?
Yesterday Mary stayed home all day.
It's hot in here.
You have to get up.
It was a revelation to me.
You've been warned.
Fish live in the sea.
What time do you go to work?
I inquired about the book in many stores.
My girlfriend was crying.
I don't want dinner.
What's really going on here?
I've never seen such a beautiful flower.
I saved you.
It gets better.
I thought you were asleep.
I'll make an exception just this once.
Tom told me he didn't have much time.
He lives in this neighborhood.
Why are people afraid of you?
I want you back.
A delicate balance must be reached.
I thought you'd be interested in this.
The world is dangerous.
Do you have to do this very often?
Drink this juice.
I liked working with you.
I am tired of hearing you moan and groan.
I lost your number.
Let's have a chat.
Don't be late for school.
Tom goes to school by bicycle.
Shut off the water.
How many sisters do you have?
I need to see Tom now.
I'm timid.
Do not talk with your mouth full.
I'm too old for you.
I inherited his estate.
By the time we got there, it was already too late.
I belong to a swimming club.
It's still warm.
Tom didn't mean it.
I'm glad you're OK again.
Are you trying to impress me?
I like you as a friend.
Do you remember your passport number?
I was deceived by her appearance.
We needed information.
I made a deal.
Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
I thought I told you to cut your hair.
His answer was far from satisfactory.
I no longer live in Boston.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
You should not go alone.
Who wants a drink?
Do I look like a policeman to you?
He is captain of the football team.
There's no food.
He reached home shortly before five o'clock.
Where are your car keys?
How many nights will you stay?
I refuse to be taken in by her guile.
We don't have to read that.
I have better things to do than stand here and take your insults.
Is he still there?
What is this nonsense?
With the weather getting worse, the departure was put off.
Can you walk on stilts?
Many companies monitor their employees' internet activity.
Everyone is anxious to know what has become of the former champion.
She did it carefully.
The chair is broken.
A child today would not do that.
You have a little fever today, don't you?
They went crazy.
I'm pleased with their performance.
Man to man, what are the facts?
He looked bewildered.
Tom knocked on Mary's door.
Straighten up.
My father is at home.
He did it out of curiosity.
Where is she?
My pen is out of ink.
Step on the scale.
He wrenched the letter from my hand.
If you don't eat, you'll die.
We talked about it all night.
The mere sight of a dog frightens him.
You need to take a cold shower.
None of us want that.
We often have barbecues and pool parties.
A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him around.
It's up to you.
They spent the night on the beach.
I'll finish it in two or three minutes.
I thought I was alone here.
He went upstairs to her room.
She lay awake for hours thinking about him.
You aren't invited.
Woods burn easily.
He is my uncle.
I love your city.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
Where have you been all this while?
I think they like you.
This hat is a little too small for me.
I'll give you this money.
Stay with us.
Tell Tom where he should go.
We'll probably be away for a few days.
Sooner or later, the hostages will be released.
My father is a teacher.
I burned it.
A fork fell off the table.
Did you have fun?
I want to say I'm sorry.
He was listening to the music in his room.
I feel the same way.
He is still alive.
Tom said that you wanted to go with us.
You look happy.
I have a little something for you.
She was kind enough to show me the way.
Either stop talking or say something worth hearing.
They're terrified of you.
Sometimes the first symptom of cardiovascular disease is death.
Can you catch the chicken?
I want my room painted white.
It's very dangerous.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Will you go to the dance with me?
I don't really care what you think.
You should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.
Tom told me to stay at home.
Put yourself in my place.
You need to be more patient.
You are beautiful.
I was incredibly bored.
If he'd known the truth, he'd have told me.
By the time we got there, the ship had left.
His wealth has not made him happy.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
We had fun with it.
I don't want to leave you.
Everything's taken care of.
That's a really good point.
She whispered something to him.
Everyone fell asleep.
He escaped from prison.
I've been following you.
I love chocolate.
We all make mistakes, right?
I wish they would stop fighting.
She'd rather be spending time with someone else.
They were responsible for the accident.
They made sure nobody could see them.
That's how I would've done it.
You don't want to point that gun at me.
Keep your hands above the table.
I can't see a thing.
I ended up winning.
He is a pioneer in this field.
You are too late.
I think you ought to listen.
They hang out together all the time.
May I use your car today?
Get that thing off of me.
When did you say that?
What is the poorest country in the European Union?
It has no parallel.
I am not proud of this.
We're expecting a good harvest this year.
My brother is a freshman.
Nothing seems right.
We acted in good faith.
I can't explain the difference between those two.
That's an ugly tie.
I wish that Tom was here to help us.
Don't stop until I tell you.
I don't get the connection.
Has something happened to Tom?
I heard you got a new car.
What sport do you like best?
I hope you brought coffee.
She told him that she didn't love him.
What happens next?
Are you leaving now?
I was actually kind of serious.
Do you think I'm ugly?
I often feel homesick.
What's your favorite cartoon?
Tom is perfect for you.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
I'll take it inside.
Are you and Tom still together?
I was really tired so I went to bed early.
What are you writing?
My sister will get married early next year.
You're crafty.
I don't want to study today.
We all know it.
You're the only Canadian I know.
He slapped her.
This is a map of the city of Sendai.
She came out of there.
That really bothers me.
He came to see me in a different way.
Fake it till you make it.
I wasn't sure where I belonged.
They enjoy one another's company.
I've always loved you.
Does it work?
When was this church built?
The police are after me.
I am bored out of my mind.
I want us to be friends again.
I would advise you strongly to do what the boss asked you to do.
He swam until he could swim no more.
He broke his word.
Their car passed ours.
Are we ready to go?
I'm still your friend.
I wish you'd told me before.
I like mathematics.
You should make up your own mind.
I was up almost all night.
I majored in philosophy at my university.
He has the Joker.
I will provide you all the necessary information.
You should begin with easier questions.
Come in.
Why did you accept this assignment?
This is not a small problem.
I have midterms next week.
Have you ever read a book written about Japan?
What's this?
She is shy of strangers.
I'm sure you have other skills.
Don't forget to mail this letter on your way to school.
Do you like summer?
I think this is beside the point, right now.
I can't walk any farther.
How much are you being paid to do this?
That's against the rules.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
Don't let this information leak out.
Bring it here.
It's very expensive.
Did you love Tom?
She got engaged to him.
We ought to win.
Can he do it?
Don't forget your costume.
It's all I need.
Not all criminals should go to jail.
Wait till six.
I really appreciate your coming.
I have made up my mind to leave Japan.
Do you guys need a ride?
You shouldn't take the things Tom says seriously.
Come on up here.
I'd like to file a complaint.
I feel as if I were dreaming.
The coffee was so hot that I couldn't drink it.
She is after a better job.
I can tell you're a nice guy.
That problem is not avoidable.
She doesn't like to leave anything unfinished.
I don't know how long it'll take.
Something has happened to my right eye.
I never told you to quit.
She gave us some useful information.
I don't know how to reach you.
They cheated the workers out of money.
The result was disappointing.
You are twice as strong as me.
I think of you all the time.
Although he's young, he's an outstanding doctor.
Tom wants you to do him a favor.
I wanted to ask Tom why.
Did you telephone him?
Could you give us a minute, please?
I'd like to spend more time with you.
I've got all the time in the world.
I panicked.
I don't know why you're all so angry.
I went there for the express purpose of earning money.
What were you hoping to see?
I grew up near a river.
Making money is not the only goal in life.
He was nearly drowned.
Does he like his job?
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
You're going to be OK.
Take all the time you want.
Tom has been growing a beard all summer.
You could hear a pin drop.
Did you hear my son play the violin?
He's been divorced for 2 years already.
He won't talk to her and she won't talk to him.
Did he look like a doctor?
I haven't read all of these books.
You must hurry up.
She's sure to succeed.
I think we need more information.
Is there something that you want to tell me?
Am I fully covered in case of an accident?
Let's hope this works.
"I'm not interrupting anything, am I?" "No, of course not."
He made a will last year.
Who's to say which is better?
I can't stop coughing.
Is this your beer?
Tom has gotten himself into trouble before.
No one seems to know what this is used for.
That is a table.
I'll go get my car.
I'll check again.
I just got some good news.
I've never seen you like this.
How could you say that?
I've got a pacemaker.
The towel was quite useless.
I see her sweeping the room.
I don't know that yet.
She must have told a lie.
You're rich.
I will call on you again.
I figured I had enough money.
I know you want to make me happy.
You're not allowed to park here.
Don't take it personal.
You're the last person I expected to see here.
He came back home a while ago.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
He can't read it.
The sun is rising now.
Make a guess.
I can't carry on like this.
Just say yes or no.
He kept standing against a tree.
Do you know where we live?
Did she sleep well?
I have a bruise.
How many rooms are there in your house?
It's my turn to drive next.
I'll do my homework.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
They're doing it right.
The hostages will be released.
I really hope you can come.
You're sick!
He does not need a wife to look after him.
They arrived at the foot of the mountain.
This has never happened before.
Can you keep a secret?
What's the last thing you remember?
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
I think Tom is impolite.
He was about to speak.
Staying at home is boring.
Who will come with me?
Stay right there.
What kind of deodorant do you prefer, spray or roll-on?
I want this room sealed.
He runs the business with his sons.
He did not know where to go.
When I was your age, I was already married.
Do you want to do this now?
I'm wondering if I love Tom.
I want to stay at the Hilton Hotel.
They are not at all interested.
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow.
Forgive me for being late.
I did everything.
City life has advantages and disadvantages.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Why do you ask?
Our school is fifty years old.
We can't just act as if nothing has happened.
A ball is floating down the river.
I think it's time for me to buy a new car.
We all have fun.
Do you have any idea where Tom went?
It's already been done.
Where did you go?
We elected him president.
Let's try to understand one another.
He is addicted to cocaine.
Tom knew he was being watched.
She's in the hospital now.
My mother has gone to the beauty shop.
That's weird, isn't it?
It never occurred to me that he might be an escaped prisoner.
Were you with my father today?
I would give anything to win her back.
Turn off the lights.
I made these boxes myself.
He accelerated his car and overtook me.
Be nicer to your sister.
You said we'd never catch Tom.
I'll risk that.
He is not a singer, but an actor.
You've got a lot of nerve bringing me here under false pretenses.
Did you understand me?
That's what I believe.
You can't have both.
He employs a maid.
Why don't we all go?
Nothing but peace can save the world.
That toy is selling like hot cakes.
It really depends on when.
The day will soon come when man can travel to Mars.
He has a cat and two dogs.
I'd rather stay at home than go out.
This is a DVD.
I am fond of music.
Did Tom listen to you?
I was ignorant of his plan.
His words hurt her feelings.
I will see to it that you meet her at the party.
I am not certain about that.
She is a twin.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
Have they made progress?
Is that your sister?
I knew things about Tom that even his parents didn't know.
Tom had no sons.
What's my room number?
It's beautifully made.
I don't owe you anything.
Last summer we went to Hokkaido.
What did they hit you with?
Here I come.
You look happy.
She is in her hotel now.
Don't be upset.
I can swim fast.
It's a drop in the bucket.
The baby is sleeping.
I always try to stay optimistic.
She was a great help to me.
Why is Mary going with him to the picnic?
I love to paint with watercolors.
I want to become a singer.
You cannot take back what you have said.
I don't know his address.
You are late this morning.
I don't care about your past.
How do you calculate the volume of a cube?
Don't worry about the cost.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
I'm rested.
He's been doing this for over twenty years.
The lecture covered a lot of ground.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
Do you miss it?
If you have any difficulty, ask me for help.
Can we really learn to speak a foreign language like a native?
I'll never forget visiting Paris last summer.
Smoking harms your health.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
Did he show you the picture?
We wear the same size.
Nobody wants to do that.
I hope you learned your lesson.
There have been many cases of cholera this year.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
You're not a teenager yet.
She mended her socks.
She is around twenty years of age.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
A calamity was avoided by sheer luck.
He is a good tennis player.
The tip of the key broke.
You might as well throw your money away as spend it on gambling.
I didn't mean it like that.
I hope Tom's predictions are wrong.
That dress looks really nice on you.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Everyone was really impressed with that machine.
Would you excuse me?
What is popular now?
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
I told you I hated that shirt.
Don't they drive you mad?
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
Say that again.
The news soon spread all over the village.
This is insanity.
I need to take your temperature.
How old are you?
What's your favorite kind of candy?
I was very tired.
It's all Greek to me.
I didn't understand the joke.
Tom is much taller than you are.
You should go to the dentist and have that tooth pulled out.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm happy you liked it.
When did the robbery happen?
My nose is stuffed up.
Tom will fix it.
I want you to try it.
She was very surprised at the news.
I'll go get the proper forms.
How could we have been so stupid?
When did you start writing songs?
Why won't anybody talk about this?
She asked him to stay, but he had to go to work.
Tom wanted a divorce.
I know all of them.
I don't feel like eating sushi.
I thought it might be better to tell you now instead of later.
This patient is suffering from hypoxia.
It looks really good.
Keep in touch!
I am so sorry.
Do you know how fast you were going?
Swimming is one thing I can do fairly well.
What would you do in my place?
I have a lot of work still outstanding.
She would often bring home table scraps from the restaurant where she worked to feed to her dog.
What kind of training have you had?
We drive everywhere.
She continued studying all her life.
You can't leave until you've said goodbye to Tom.
It's fun to play tennis.
You tried.
It's getting dark.
Thanks for showing me how to do that.
If you'd prefer a room closer to the Convention Center, please let us know.
Can you guess where I am right now?
I couldn't tell her from sister.
Would you look after my children while I am away on vacation?
What is today's date?
I can't prove it, but I'm sure he was murdered.
This bird can fly.
Do you plan to go abroad?
Did you catch the first train?
He's screaming, not singing.
Do you want to cancel the meeting?
He is enrolled at that university.
Everybody's here.
I owe you a breakfast.
Where is the elevator?
Do you enjoy losing?
Did you see a brown wallet around here?
I can't see.
Monkeys can learn a lot of tricks.
Nobody will believe that rumor.
I hid it somewhere.
Come on, trust me.
She has been sick since last week.
I will have graduated from college by the time you come back from America.
He became famous.
You had better turn off the light before you go to sleep.
He is drawing a picture.
I can't hear what you're saying.
She came to like the house.
You were the one who gave this to me.
I figured I could count on you.
Why didn't you tell me that last night?
He has visited Europe several times.
You need to be careful.
I chickened out.
I feel terrible.
He likes to watch TV.
I heard a noise.
Do you like oysters?
You're acting like a child.
What time do you think Tom will get home?
You're never at home.
That wasn't accurate, was it?
I'll show you later.
I asked her to call me at five o'clock.
Please excuse my ignorance.
He is not old enough to live alone.
I'm doing well.
I don't think he can handle the truth.
I could feel the sand between my toes.
Tom can't explain what happened.
I was momentarily blinded.
I didn't ask you to come with us.
It is fun to play cards.
What do we do now?
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
You had better not eat too much.
They kicked Tom out of the bar.
What is the tallest mountain in Europe?
They don't take care of that dog.
My house has two bedrooms.
You're thin.
Look at that picture.
When should I come again?
Let me see that list.
He died a few days later.
She talked him into buying a new house.
Tom sat alone with a half-empty bottle of wine.
Tickets are still available if you hurry.
Do not say such foolish things.
I'm glad to see you.
I ran into a friend on the bus.
You should not have done it without my permission.
Finally, I finished a painting.
I know a little Spanish.
It's going to be harder this time.
What do Italians usually eat for lunch?
Is that unfair?
Tom wants Mary to know he's not planning on asking her to marry him.
Please don't make me eat that.
I don't deserve your friendship.
Tom wanted to dance with Mary.
He looked through a magazine.
We're not done.
It took time.
Sorry, we don't accept credit cards.
I had to do what I did.
Murder is against the law.
He made a bad decision.
The more money we have, the more we want.
It's all we have.
Tom is drunk.
He is much older than he looks.
Make your bed.
I want to hear you play the piano.
It gave me the creeps.
Are you real sure about that?
They're studying French and web design.
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man.
I'm not discouraged.
He was re-elected mayor.
I won't do it again.
You look happy today.
This plant is good to eat.
I couldn't remember ever having met her.
We have exams right after summer vacation.
I'm sorry, but I cannot answer right away.
I think you did an excellent job.
This is typical.
Did you volunteer us?
She stayed out in the rain.
She decided to drink water instead of soft drinks in order to lose weight.
Do you miss it?
I am glad to see her.
You bought it from Tom, didn't you?
I had a stroke.
Did you read it all?
They gave us very little trouble.
But his name is slightly familiar to me.
"You've got a crush on this girl." "No, I don't!"
We all have our orders.
I carried one bag, but the other one was left behind.
I have to make sure everything is OK.
I'm not presentable.
Are you happy with that?
Where did you learn this?
There's someone waiting for me outside.
Tom is wiser than I am.
He anonymously donated a large sum of money to the Red Cross.
How was Boston?
You're wanted on the phone. It's from Tom.
I just want us to stay together.
I just love that.
She advised him not to go.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
I glanced through the brochure.
I'd like a glass of water.
The clean towels are in the drawer.
They're looking for you.
Is anyone surprised?
Who taught you how to dance?
Talking in the library is not allowed.
If you hit a patch of fog, slow down and put your blinkers on.
We should follow his example.
He looked young beside his brother.
We finally have you where we want you.
Are you happy right now?
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
The sky is full of stars.
It's a fad.
What is it you want to talk about?
The more we learn, the more we know.
Today was a terrible day.
I've never come across such a strange case.
I thought I heard your voice.
It was deliberate.
I'd like to talk to you.
The line is busy now. Please hold the line.
Do they take care of the dog?
I'm smarter than you.
How long have you been working here?
If I were you, I'd follow his advice.
He is good at driving.
The check, please.
Do you really want to work with us?
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
If you'd asked me, I'd have told you.
He majors in English literature.
To drive a car, you need a license.
The girl was aware of the danger.
Remain seated, please.
It's important to know one's limits.
Is everything ready?
I want life to be the way it was before.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
I feel a little awkward.
Your behavior was disgraceful.
I didn't need anyone's help.
I caught a cold two days ago.
I have always considered you a close friend.
I'm not sure if it's a compliment or an insult.
I'm still single.
You don't know what it's like to not have enough to eat.
This is the last message I ever plan to send to you.
She is an obstinate girl.
You're the only one who understands me.
The sun is shining brightly.
Come get it.
I want to do this right.
It's awfully cold this evening.
They stopped talking.
I'll pick you up at your home.
He felt it was his duty to go.
This is the lady who wants to see you.
They teased the new student.
Who am I addressing?
We're back early.
It's very late.
Tom isn't a child.
The tiger was killed.
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
I don't understand why it happened.
The buildings are small in comparison with the skyscrapers in New York.
Funding for this program was provided by the following sponsors.
Someone is lying.
Please hurry, it's urgent.
Don't tell anyone.
I've got a pair of sunglasses.
Look, I want you to do me a favor.
You and I are going together.
I promise you I'll keep you safe.
They made me do it.
I don't want to know.
I don't want to talk about it.
He is roasting coffee beans.
Why should I go?
They acted on the information.
We have seen no one.
Why are you flinching?
I am very sorry for what I said.
Have another.
He slept well last night.
I'm not fat.
When are you busy?
That better not be Tom.
We're both fine.
Could you come and see me tomorrow?
I have a proposition for you.
Don't thank me now.
Many ethnic groups traditionally give money as a wedding gift.
I should've listened to you.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
Everyone kept talking.
I'm not very patient.
I don't know how to do that.
When I heard that song, it reminded me of when I was a kid.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had.
I have the dictionary.
She is certainly above forty.
I don't really care how you do it.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
She pulled my shirt.
I refrain from drinking.
Who believes in God?
He's a sweet guy.
I'm glad that he passed the exam.
Why are you doing this to me?
What is the ultimate purpose of education?
Don't lie. Be honest.
You're really awesome.
I'm sorry I had to leave you alone.
The moment I held the baby in my arms, it began to cry.
His clothes are out of fashion.
Wait a bit.
You can't do that.
He lived in a town near by.
All of them were gone.
I wonder if this is really true.
I lost interest.
They will survive.
You have overstepped your authority.
He flinches whenever he hears a loud, sudden noise.
Thanks for supporting me.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
I couldn't make myself understood well in English.
I went to bed early because I was tired.
Good afternoon.
I've really missed you.
My father had me wash the car.
You're pathetic.
Turn it up.
Let's discuss the matter right now.
What languages do they speak in Korea?
You are not to leave this room.
People often complain about the weather.
I'm sorry, we're completely sold out.
I'm no longer afraid of spiders.
We went to the beach to swim.
Tom will be busy tomorrow.
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
Let Tom do his job.
When is school over?
Today is extremely hot.
Let's start!
She went shopping with him last Monday.
I love watching movies that make me think.
I heard voices through the wall.
There is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.
That is the fastest train in the world.
Tom's garage is filled with things that he never uses.
I don't work for you.
I sleep with two quilts in the winter.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Were there any problems?
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
They were scolded by the teacher.
I wish I had studied English harder when I was young.
Do we have to take the bus?
Nobody cares how much the dinner is going to cost.
I'll play along.
I told you I could help you.
I thought you'd be alone.
Tom was worried about that.
We had a large audience.
I want to talk with the manager about the schedule.
That never used to bother me.
It's unlikely that that movie will make a lot of money.
Tom is hard up for money.
I can't give up.
I don't think that Tom can speak French.
We have a stressful day ahead of us.
I could sense that Tom was upset.
Tom got out of the bathtub and dried himself off.
Move away from me.
I'm the youngest in the family.
Does the price include breakfast?
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
He is fresh from college.
I was arrested for aiding in his escape.
Have you asked if they want one?
She forced him to sit down.
I have my own reasons.
She watched him dance.
Don't you understand what's going on here?
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Our town was bombed twice this week.
I looked in my closet for something to wear, but couldn't find anything appropriate for the occasion.
Tom was dangerous.
Your family should come before your career.
Go and wake her up.
The room was full of smoke.
She is talking.
Is there a student discount?
I have to give back the book before Saturday.
My brother is healthy.
I can barely see it.
We wandered aimlessly around the shopping district.
The nurse hit a blood vessel.
Spring has come.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
I think you should swim.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
The sun was shining brightly.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
I was skeptical at first.
I'd like to know a little bit more about you.
He is not running in the coming election.
That man died of lung cancer a week ago.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
I have nothing particular to say now.
I wish I had asked you for advice.
We cut off the rope.
Who is the man who was talking with you?
Why were you absent yesterday?
I have not seen him in months.
I wasn't expecting Tom to be there.
It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
A rash broke out on her neck.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
Everybody plays the game of love.
I figure that she will succeed in her business.
I will not be free tomorrow.
Just tell him the truth.
I hated history class.
He pretended that he was a lawyer.
I don't know where that came from.
It's incredible.
I was busy cooking.
I declined for personal reasons.
Canada is really big and there are lots of people.
She wants him.
I haven't attended any of his conferences.
Is that your car?
I think Tom could do better.
Are you that stupid?
Be polite to everyone.
I used to think that only bears hibernate, but the teacher said that turtles do as well.
You gotta get more organized.
The rumor is true.
Please have a seat.
Have you tried this before?
Don't trust him.
He doesn't read many newspapers.
That's not my cup of tea.
All the sails were taken down.
Do you know what UNESCO stands for?
If you won a million yen, what would you do?
He cleared his throat before starting the lecture.
You're the owners.
I've been studying French for a very long time.
I don't really cook much.
Did they say why?
Come here, all of you.
We're alone here.
Don't you think this is ridiculous?
What goes around, comes around.
Do you know what this is all about?
It's been three years since the accident.
Thank you for all the gifts.
Let me tell you everything I know.
It was a quiet winter evening.
I don't intend to answer any questions.
I was going out, when the telephone rang.
They can manage.
He's a Democrat fundraiser.
Clearly you are mistaken.
I thought we could do it.
It's like being a kid in a candy store.
I think they like us.
No Canadians were injured.
My grandfather cannot walk without a walking stick.
I'm going to get on the next bus.
I want to write all of this down.
She visited him once a year.
I don't watch that show.
My father doesn't drink so much sake.
The car he's driving is not his.
He has trouble remembering names.
The tire on my bicycle is flat.
What am I supposed to do with them?
I bribed them.
That couple gets soused nearly every night.
Please don't speak so fast.
You've barely said a word all night.
How are you now?
I hardly ever run into him.
Yesterday my bicycle was stolen while I was doing some shopping.
How do you know what's real?
They were stuck for hours in a traffic jam.
I have serious doubts.
Why don't you give me what I want?
First of all, I'm very worried about my daughter's health.
The guitar player is my brother.
I thought you wanted this.
They followed you here.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Learning French takes time.
Take care not to catch a cold.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
Please remember to mail the letter.
I had him write it.
Let's review Lesson 5.
She snuck out the house without him knowing.
What do those lights signify?
I bear no grudge against you.
Without water, nothing could live.
I got hot.
I regret that I did not work harder.
I'm not invited to parties.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
He had no memory of the accident.
Where do you live?
I look forward to seeing you again.
Please introduce me to her.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
We all want prices to fall.
I'll go back to Boston.
There are a lot of abandoned houses in the neighborhood.
You're scaring me.
I like my job.
I dreamed I had been abducted by aliens.
Don't jump to any conclusions.
He was accused of being a spy.
You can't just come in here and start ordering people around.
They'll like that.
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
He had a blue jacket on.
Thank you in advance.
Why don't you look for a job?
Mt. Aso is an active volcano.
Scientists are slowly piecing together the mechanism of aging.

For months, he did almost nothing.
If you need more information, we are happy to send it.
He was fired by the school.
I'm tired of your complaints.
She must go there.
Sleep is essential to health.
Do you have any sisters?
Let me think about it.
We're confident.
No one was killed.
I'm depressed.
I'm going to call an ambulance.
We're out of coffee.
What is the purpose of education?
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
I got here a little early today.
Do you deliver on Sundays?
I've never heard English spoken so quickly.
I was reading a novel then.
It doesn't look too hard.
I can't teach you anything else.
He's very ill.
How far is it from here to the station?
A childhood illness left her blind.
What's going to happen to our pets?
He was acquitted.
That boy speaks like an adult.
I discouraged him from going swimming since it looked like it was going to rain.
The talisman he's wearing is supposed to ward off evil spirits.
Were you one of them?
You should turn off your cell phone.
She talks to her sister on the phone for hours at a time.
I'm economically independent of my parents.
When's Tom arriving?
Please send any complaints or suggestions to the following email address.
I'm kidding.
I go to the barber once a month.
Just do what you have to do.
Contact me tomorrow.
You can ask Tom for help.
Tom and Mary know each other well.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
I wonder what it could be.
We'll have lived here for two years next April.
He demanded that I should pay the money back at once.

I really don't have enough money.
I didn't think you'd be coming.
He got ahead of me.
Come and get it.
I can wait no longer.
You need a joystick.
You should have kept your mouth shut.
It saddens me to hear you say that.
We're just tired.
What do you do in your free time?
Where did you get it?
Maybe it really was an accident.
Must I hurry?
May I look at the menu?
My brother is engaged in cancer research.
Boys are strange sometimes.

I felt a drop of rain.
He's about to go.
I would like to thank you for your cooperation.
Tom gave me this book.
Have fun, but don't get lost.
Do you trust anyone?
I paid him the money last week.

Bring along your friend.
Most of the time, he doesn't get to sleep before two or even three o'clock in the morning.

Thanks for the explanation.
Could we have a spoon?
You might get hurt.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
I'll be ready.
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
I'm satisfied.
It's unusual for him to get up early.
I can wait for you.
You'll feel better now.
He was excommunicated.
I don't like your attitude.
Tom's boss advanced him a week's wages.
Where are the others?
You're not being rational.
It only costs $10.00!
He made no reply.
Don't worry about your family.
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.
They know what happened.
I couldn't help but laugh.
Does anyone know you're here?
You've made no allowance for the fact that he is young.
They just want to have fun.
If you feed your dog properly, you can increase his lifespan.
How long will you be here?
Quit complaining.
Don't sleep too deeply.
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
Since he was tired, he went to bed.
I like the way you talk.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
I wish I had your job.
If you don't go, I will not go either.
I'll take my dog out for a walk.
He had the courage to decline the offer.
I didn't sleep much last night.
As far as I am concerned, I have no objection.

Between you and me, I don't like our new team captain.
You won't feel a thing.
It was a quiet night.
I saw someone.
I can't find Tom.
Tom showed Mary several pictures of his house.
You'll have to drive.
What was your question?
That made me laugh.
She started pursuing him before he became famous.
They are alone.
I hate to do this.
At first, they were all convinced he was innocent.

Show me.

I did what you asked.
Could you call me back a bit later?

Look, I don't want to lose my job.
We have decided to adopt your idea.
Will you pay cash?
Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news.
I have no idea how it works.
By postponing what you have to do, you run the risk of never being able to do it.

I'm sure.
I don't know if I should tell you.
Is there anything else you want from me?
Tom draws well.
I could hear everything.
A child is missing.
I refuse to answer.
Tom thought Mary was kidding.
Do you want to bet on that?
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be the boss.
He often uses a subway.
I need air.
I'm not privy to their decisions.
I failed the exam because I didn't study.
He stole my heart.
You can't hurt me any more than you already have.
Tom seems to be waiting for someone.
He had a rough childhood.
The cool air felt wonderful on my face.
Tom put two slices of bread into the toaster and pushed down on the lever.
I am lazy.
It's high time the children went to bed.
I've always thought you knew how to swim.
Even though the weather was bad, I decided to go out.
He is the spitting image of his father.

My friend studies Korean.
Do you know anyone here?
I hope this works.
How are things at home?
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
You're not as smart as me.
I didn't want to wait for anything.
They hurried by without a glance.
What are you trying to hide?
I'll be at Tom's.
He says that he has no memory of the evening.
We're always careful.
Children should play outside.
This video is boring.
I wanted everything.
Let's have some fun.
I think that he has mumps.
My friends gave us a whirlwind tour of Paris.
He congratulated me on my success.
You're a wonderful friend.
Is there anything that I can do for you?
I'll sleep on the floor.
They're gone.
Tom kept his hat on.
I haven't given the money to Tom yet.
Can you ride a horse?
When should I feed my dog?
Are you still not convinced?
"When do you swim?" "I swim in July."
I had to make a decision.
I think we could be good friends.
They want us to come in right away.
Make an effort.
I'll miss you.
Please don't leave me here by myself.
It's almost over.
I don't expect you to understand it.
Please remember to mail the letter on your way home.
Don't take it personally.
Do I have to undress?
Why are you wearing a sweater?
I think it must've happened just the way Tom said it did.
I'd like to order the same.
Everybody is relying on you.
This medicine will make you feel better.
All you have to do is try your best.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
I found it necessary to get assistance.
I am near the station.
Maybe he has lots of girlfriends.
I was in all day.
Have a good Christmas.
It was once thought that there was intelligent life on Mars.
Time's up. Please pass in your exams.
My husband sends his best regards to you.
It's a surprise.
You don't belong here.
They're alive.
This forum is great.
We had to wait for him for ten minutes.
Why are you so secretive?
He's a smooth talker.
I'll be watching you.
Did I fall asleep?
The moment he saw me he ran away.
Forget I said anything.
Parents must provide their children with proper food and clothing.
You need to be more careful from now on.

You want me to help you, don't you?
As soon as I can figure out how to send money, I'll send you some.
We're getting closer.
How long did it last?
Tom seems angry.
Why do we dream?
Many people are on vacation.
I have no idea why it is so.
You're not even paying attention.
I didn't understand any of that.
We can't go anywhere today.
She takes a shower every morning.
She's curious to find out who sent the flowers.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
If anyone can do it, you can.
Do you really think Tom is happy?
Anybody want a lift?
You're aggressive.
You are in part responsible for it.
I get the feeling that no one here is telling us the truth.
Do you enjoy talking?
I know what time you said to be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time.
Don't worry about your dog. I'll take care of him.
If you want to do good work, you should use the proper tools.
Some of the money was stolen.
He didn't say a word.
Are you excited?
Stay a little longer.

I want that book.
Do you have many friends?
She is as beautiful as Snow White.
I didn't know it was snowing.
No one can help us.
I guess I was wrong.
We should take his youth into account.
I'll tell you a story.
I think you're nuts.

I only hope it is not too late.
You're very rude.
Do you understand what's going on?

He has spent ten years in jail for murder.
They're right behind me.
This pen is very easy to write with.

Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
This looks like a close-range gunshot wound.
He wants to spend time with his daughter.
I was hungry and angry.
It's not your style.
My heart began to race.
Tom knows what he's talking about.
I'm not home on Sundays.
Did I tell you that?
I've eaten all the crackers.
There used to be an old temple here.
You're not a city girl, are you?
May I go home?
She's worried about your safety.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
That's a pretty name.
I need surgery.
You're probably tired.

The method was crude, but very effective.
Mother bought me the book.
Are you blushing?
When will his new novel be published?
That's a ridiculous idea.
Does that mean you'll have to stay?
Could you please briefly introduce yourself?
We had hardly started when it began to rain.
Pay attention to what Tom says.
We're studying French and web design.
I didn't know why I wasn't supposed to go to that part of town.
Nothing's been changed.
Would you mail this letter for me on your way to school?
I didn't tell you everything.
I'm dying for a cold drink.
That book had a lot of pages.
She really got on my nerves.
Everybody desires happiness.
Jobs are hard to come by these days.
This job doesn't pay.
I feel the same way as you do.
We all know what happened here.
You can't just walk in here and start dictating policy.
I think we need a doctor.
I brought you some water.
Mary works part-time as a nurse.
What contemporary authors do you like?

You're off the hook.
I really need to go outside and get some fresh air.
They've just left.
I'm going to stay there for about a week.
You can't keep this a secret.

I am in the garden.
When did you get this?
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was forced to resign.

I'm well aware of that.

Go get changed.
I want that more than anything.
I will have my sister pick you up at the station.
He's my best friend. We're like brothers.
They basked in the sun.

I would never consider building a house in this area.
I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
We all helped with the harvest.
Can I call you back in twenty minutes?

I overheard your conversation.
You know where I'm going.
I lost the bet.
I hate that movie.
Did anybody see what happened?
She gave me a strange look.
I have no plans whatsoever.
You are abusing your authority.
We're not going to make it.
Why don't you return to your quarters?
She is what we call a bookworm.
Tom still loves Mary.
How is your daughter?
There are many good reasons not to do it.
We study music.
Find Tom before he tells someone.
You're free of all responsibility.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Don't read my journal.
I'll ask my brother to give me a ride.
I felt responsible.
The second the mailman comes, he rushes out to pick up his mail.
You haven't given me what I asked for.

You must not make noises in the classroom.
I may need to move on.
If we don't get something to eat soon, we'll all starve to death.

He didn't tell me everything.
I don't think you have much choice.
It's just not right.
This ticket is good for three days.

It is unlike him to be late.
My brother took me to the museum.
How many times have you done this?
I can't look at this photo without feeling very sad.

I want to buy you a drink.
I have fewer books than you.
She won't call this evening.
Let me see it.
He ruled his kingdom fairly.
I want to know who did that.

I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
I want to see if he really fixed this.
I promise I will protect you.
We use a lot of water every day.
I meet him at the club from time to time.
Write something.
I'm against it.
Everybody's dead.
Keep away from the dog.
There's too much at stake.
I guess that's good for you.

Just give it a shot.
Let's come back here someday.
We've just cleaned the toilets.
If I could, I would let every caged bird fly free.

She asked me to bring them.
You are so childish sometimes.
The moon has no atmosphere.
You're not married, are you?
Do you know anyone who was on that ship that sunk?
I have just what you need.
Have you turned off the gas yet?
I'm asking what you think.
We used a barrel for a makeshift table.
There's a general sense that something should be done about unemployment.
Well, tell me what you know.
Lead the way.
Do you remember anything?
Tom can't do anything about that.
I might not come back.
I'd like to reserve a seat.
Tom waited for me.
They say that he knows the secret.
There is no telling when they will come.
That's not important for you to know.

Why did you kiss me?
Let's just say I'm here to stay.
My hobby is collecting insects.
I don't feel like playing either.
The price of meat dropped.
Let me do the talking.
What's the temperature?
What's your favorite fruit?
She brought him to our place to meet my parents.
I can't put up with him any longer.

I'll be there in a sec.
How old are your kids?
Sleep is essential to health.
No one helped me.
She said that she was happy.
He'll be a good husband.
At last, he realized his error.
Mary has stopped smoking.
I give you everything you ask for, but you never seem satisfied.
I don't have a dress good enough for such an occasion.
Is Tom related to Mary?
Here is your change.
Let me introduce myself.
I don't think being poor is anything to be ashamed of.
That's my chair.
The more I think about it, the less I understand it.
He came to pick me up.
It is kind of you to give me a ride.
That is your book.
Everyone looked relieved.
I don't really like you.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
He's so thin that he looks like a skeleton.
She was impatient to know his address.
The gun is jammed.
He is very tall.
Please stop talking. I need to concentrate on my game.

I was just looking around.
I live in Tokyo.
Can't this wait until things are back to normal?
I've got accustomed to speaking in public.
We're going to do everything we can.
You've been infected.
I can't remember how to go there.
We better be going.
I don't consider this to be important.
The woman hugged the baby.
She is pigeon-toed.
Who did you visit yesterday afternoon?
I was going to ask Tom to do that.
I also gave him a little something as a Christmas present the other day.
I thought you might need some help getting ready for your wedding.
Let me get you the key.
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
He needs money.
Tom wanted me to learn French.
She's too old for you.
I called her, but the line was busy.
That's how I would do it.
The root of a flower is as weak as a baby's finger.
Tom will be back home soon.
I was really young when I met you.
His father has never scolded him.
Now I'm a little scared.
Tom was killed in Boston.
I'd like to sail around the world.
Everyone knows Tom isn't happy here.
I had to face this alone.
My uncle is staying with us this week.
Take care not to catch a cold.
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
Canada has thirteen provinces and territories.
We're protecting you.
Do you want to eat out tonight?
I bought a shirt yesterday.
If I were you, I wouldn't do such a thing.
Tom is a con artist.
Take your hat off when you enter a house of worship.
Tom's glad.
There's a spider in the shower.
I have misjudged you.
What makes you think Tom can do this?
I mistook you for your brother.
I think it's time for me to call it a day.
No matter how hard I practiced, I wasn't able to do the backstroke.
Despite the government’s protection, he was the victim of an assassination attempt which killed him.
I hope you have a good trip.
Eat everything.
How do you know where to go?
The weather is getting worse.
I'm sick of fighting.
I'm trying to remember.
I feel like another beer.
He works at night.
I often ski.
This car won't start.
You're fashionable.
I didn't think it would matter.
May I go with him?
I'm playing with my friends.
The summer vacation is over.
I've seen it all.
We'd do anything to help you.
You don't have to come.
You can use mine.
What would your mother think if she saw you like this?
That's chicken.
Don't get so carried away.
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
There's no food left.
You live in my heart.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
I can't detect any pattern.
We shared ideas.
I went to bed at twelve last night.
I know you have a girlfriend.
Will you watch the superbowl?
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Stop right here.
I can't stand the noise.
Do you believe in God?
Large amounts of money were spent on the new bridge.
Are you going to save us?
What are you so happy about?
I'm depending on you.
She always acts politely toward everybody.
How many eggs could you get yesterday?
Do I have your permission to do so?
He was moved to tears when he heard the news.
I can't believe you turned down that job.
Ten people were slightly injured in the accident.
I wonder which of you will win.
I don't need to talk to you.
Can you swim?
I want to run for president.
The ring couldn't be found anywhere.
He blamed others for his own failure.
They sell eggs at the supermarket.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
You should always knock before entering Tom's room.
Write in the date yourself.
We stayed home because it was raining.
Tom is three years older than you.
I haven't decided which job to apply for.
Do you want to get us both killed?
Do you like it?
Do you really believe in that stuff?
Could I have a slice of cheesecake?
If you want me to help you, all you have to do is ask.
You have my sympathies.
I don't know. Let me check.

You've done a lot of good.
Have you got some money?
No attention was paid to his warning.
I really appreciate the fact that you like me just the way I am.
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
You are free to leave any time you wish.
How do you intend to do it?
We agree on this point.
What's Tom's problem?
How did it go last night?
The bridge couldn't sustain the force of the strong current and collapsed.
Tom has three sons, I believe.
May I use your car today?
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
We do not accept tips.
They constructed a bridge.
We must control our passions.
This is the key that opens that door.
I want to be here with you.
I'll find you.
I was really young when I met you.
We can't see anything.
She got through her work before five.
I didn't call.
The more worthless the plant, the more rapid and splendid is its growth.
You drive a hard bargain.
When I don't have anything to say, I am not embarrassed to be quiet.
I am just a humble teacher.
There's nobody at the door.
Will we arrive in time?
I'm too tired to walk any further.
I just want to be prepared.
Give me a beer.
That cheese is made from goat's milk.
If the shop is closed today, I'll try again tomorrow.
How can you not like him?
Don't forget the receipt.
He arrived on time in spite of the rain.
You don't belong here.
Rabies is the deadliest disease on earth.
I had no intention of going there by myself.
You're not normal.
Wear warm clothes or you could get sick.
I'd like to believe that.
He turned off all the lights at eleven.
I had to climb over the wall.
She was blackmailed by him.
I mistook him for his brother.
I'm not busy right now.
He cut some branches off the tree.
She naturally accepted the invitation.
I think that was very funny.
She handed him his jacket.
You probably don't remember me.
He moved to Tokyo.
I won't negotiate.
Ironic, isn't it?
Why don't you get a haircut?
A woman's wardrobe isn't complete without a little black dress.
I am exhausted.
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
Are you envious?
Can your brother drive a car?
Don't drop that cup.
I am afraid of what the teacher will say.
I made a couple calls.
Guess what I bought today.
He didn't reveal his identity.
They study in the afternoon.
We'd better get going.
He runs a lot of hotels.
"May I help you?" "No, thank you. I'm just looking."
I'm glad you came over.
I expect him to help me.
I spent two hours yesterday trying to fix that broken radio.
You won't bleed to death.
I work in a bank.
We have to obey the rules.
All the students protested against the war.
I'm going to have to cancel my appointment.
I'm not complaining.
I think they're lying.
We're worried about Grandma and Grandpa.
That's a pretty strange-looking bracelet you're wearing.
As soon as you get the wall painted, you can go home.
Please shuffle the cards carefully.
I went for a walk to try to sober up.
I saved you.
Sit down!
The company went bankrupt.
I'll never forget the sight.
She adores cats.
He is pleased with his work.
We need time.
Your dress is already out of fashion.
I have ten times as many books as you have.
You gotta get more organized.
Don't forget to extinguish your cigarette.
I like their pictures.
We talked over the plan with him.
The wind scattered the leaves about.
What's it like?
I slept all day yesterday, because it was Sunday.
Aren't those your parents?
Don't worry. Tom won't let us down.
Human beings differ from animals in that they can think and speak.
Hi. How are you doing?
I see why you don't want to go there.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
I don't have an appointment.
Unfortunately, the report is true.
I discovered too late that I left out the most important part of my speech.
You look like a boy.
We are faced with a host of problems.
A button came off my coat.
That is another matter.
Who is your favorite player?
I got dumped.
She took a walk before breakfast.
I want to see the countryside.
I'm sorry. I'm a stranger around here.
He became famous all over the world.
I'm so embarrassed, I want to die.
She choked him.
I heard a young girl call for help.
This may be your last chance.
She is a really good girl.
I want to talk with your uncle.
Do I look like I care?
No one spoke.
She's very afraid of dogs.
What was in it for you?
Have you checked the suggestions box today?
I was invited.
That was the hardest job of my life.
You have to be here at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
You can go back to bed.
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
How serious is the problem?
Would you mind opening the window?
Who is the gentleman he is speaking to?
The coat I wanted was priced at three hundred dollars.
The curtain caught fire.
I'd hate to see that happen again.
When did you get married?
I can't go with you.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
I'm highly motivated.
We won.
I wasn't the only one who didn't know Tom.
The bicycle is mine.
I had to walk home.
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
I wonder whose car this is.
I wonder what all of them have in common.
Hawks are birds of prey.
Tom hopes to visit Boston next summer.
Let's ask him.
I don't know what fear is.
You're the teacher.
This is tasteless.
He must be over sixty.
Don't touch my car.
Do you know them?
There is no problem.
I met Tom at his office in Boston.
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
Do you need a hand with your suitcases?
I'd like you to meet my wife.
Her sister looks young.
Let's pick flowers from the garden.
You're sleepy.
They arranged a meeting.
I want everything to be perfect.
You were just doing your duty.
He witnessed the murder.
I'll take one.
Stay away from the fire.
She was so angry that she could not speak.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
People tend to raise their voices when they get excited.
The sea is rough.
Where's the doctor?
There's no way off the island.
That will put you in danger.
I want to clean the house before my parents return.
We're getting close.
Happiness is a delicate flower.
It's foolish on your part to swim when it's so cold.
This shop carries men's clothing.
Can I touch it?
Are they still in bed?
You can't just not go to work.
The doctor started to examine her.
I'm a respectable businessman.
I will wait till you have written the letter.
Do you live in Turkey?
I returned to my hometown after five years' absence.
You have one hour.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
Where did you learn that?
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
If you don't like the service, don't leave a tip.
Please let me try the game.
I thought we were happy.
The result remains to be seen.
I had a weird dream.
I'll see Tom tomorrow.
Tell me your story. I am all ears.
I wanted this.
Do I look like I'm busy?
You're wrong. That's not what I said.
We kept quiet.
I speak a little Japanese.
Unfortunately, that rumor is true.
She was lying face down on the bed.
The lady is over eighty.
The lake is a long way from here.
Why don't you remember?
Tom couldn't persuade Mary to stay.
Tom bought himself a microscope.
You ought to have seen the exhibition.
Stop being so nice to me.
You can't see the forest for the trees.
He has fallen in love with me.
He's just buying time.
I hope your business trip to France was successful.
If Cleopatra's nose had been shorter, the whole face of the world would have been changed.
Is the customer always right?
Take this medicine. You will feel better soon.
Are you sure about this?
I hate all of them.
I don't plan to be here that long.
Are you dating anybody?
My new job leaves me little time to socialize.
He drew a chair near her.
They huddled together.
Make a guess.
Did you say 30?
I thought you'd be dead by now.
What's your favorite color for carpets?
Let's talk.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
The cows are eating grass.
You don't need to get a haircut this week.
In autumn the leaves turn yellow.
I like the black shoes.
I can't come up with a good idea.
Do you have a fishing license?
I hate liars.
She learned to ride a bicycle last year.
Do you have health insurance?
I knew you'd come back to me.
Stand up straight.
Does this not please you?
I gave my word.
Who wrote the Bible?
It's been three years since I've seen Tom.
I had some problems to take care of.
He is not aggressive enough to succeed in business.
We have plenty of work to do this morning.
I didn't want any of that.
Goodbyes are always sad.
I won't see him anymore.
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
Quit wasting my time.
I didn't want you to know.
Has anyone seen Tom?
I almost feel sorry for you.
Please come this way.
I want to see a volcano.
We had a lot of rain last year.
Do you have two computers?
Happy New Year!
Walk tall, son.
I like turtles.
I'd like to hear you sing.
The train was about to leave the station.
I have absolute trust in him.
Nature is full of mysteries.
You must think I'm a complete idiot.
My wife is Chinese.
They love coffee.
I've been looking for them for more than one hour.
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
Could you wrap them up separately?
The food didn't taste very good.
He has no intention to interfere with your business.
You're my enemy.
Tom's bitten his nails right down to the quick.
Is life here hard?
He was late for the 7:30 bus.
Come on, wake up.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
How was your birthday?
I must get it fixed.
Why don't you come over and eat with us this evening?
I'm going to be your lawyer.
Could I have the bill, please?
She's very afraid of dogs.
You have been warned.
I suspect they water down the beer in that pub.
Can you get that to me by the end of the day?
Is that why you called?
How much are they offering?
The accident happened before my very eyes.
Tom's boss is very demanding.
I was there the other day.
What are you doing with these dolls?
I must know the truth about him.
You do your part and I'll do the rest.
We arrived here in the evening.
They admire each other.
How is your dad?
I want them all shot.
I didn't want you involved in this.
It's not funny.
Do you feel like resting?
I'm going to get married.
The electricity is off at the moment.
I'm not angry.
It's easier to learn a new language when you are young.
Is he planning on helping us?
We have to memorize this poem by the next class.
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark.
I was late for the train.
You're famous.
She failed every time she tried.
This lid is too tight for me to open.
He appeared young.
Do you know CPR?
It was fairly funny.
What happened next?
Hold fire.
Do you know the man who's staring at you?
The prophecy came true.
I can't wait forever.
That's a hard one.
That's why I've done all this.
Canada and Mexico both share a border with the USA.
There used to be some big trees around the pond.
You won't be interested.
I'm not ready to die.
I'd like to stay for one night.
No one would listen.
How did you get to know about her?
This summer I went on vacation in Scotland.
We watched a baseball game on television.
It was not easy to convince him.
I like math best.
He wants to speak.
They are negotiating to reach a satisfactory compromise.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
You're still green.
I didn't like my teacher.
It may well be true.
It was a wise decision.
He is ahead of his class in English.
My room has a large closet.
I apologize if I offended you.
You're so mean.
Don't lie. Tell the truth.
Have you found any good solution?
I love you more and more each day.
He lives in the western part of town.
I'm amazed by the rate at which industries grow.
How did you lose it?
What should I say to Tom?
Do you have enough information to go on?
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
Will you come or not?
I wish I could believe you.
He is quite a savage.
They both snickered.
By the year 2020, the population of this city will have doubled.
Everybody blames you.
Things are not looking good.
The two of us are finally alone.
My girlfriend was crying.
You may use my dictionary.
How would you like your steak done?
I don't meet him so often.
I'm going to meet him tomorrow.
The forest is teeming with monkeys.
They'll never make it.
Is this fish still alive?
Tom must've heard us enter.
She drew the chair towards her.
He acted in his own interest.
What keeps you up at night?
I'm taking a walk in a park.
Come at once.
I can attest to everything she just said.
Let's go get snockered like we did last weekend.
Call me right back.
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
I don't need to write it down.
What do you think of that?
Tom seems very distant today.
It was quite funny.
She was wearing a strange hat.
You're a nervous wreck.
I just want to stay in the car.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
I'm the type who gets nervous in front of people, so I'm bad at speech making.
My dad works all day.
There's nothing wrong with him.
She kept me waiting for over an hour.
She is busy at present and can't speak to you.
Can you drive?
I'll see to it right away.
He is lying on the sofa.
Stop screaming.
Is she here yet?
You go first.
You can't handle this alone.
I didn't talk to anybody.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
He does it faster than you.
The lawyer believed in his client's innocence.
Where is it hidden?
I never did that.
I looked around and noticed that mine was the only car on the road.
Do you still love him?
I can wait for you.
You're not fired.
What do you say to dining out tonight?
He looks gloomy.
It can't hurt you.
You can't handle this alone.
I want a quart of milk.
That is the building where my father works.
I want to see how it ends.
Wow! It's been a long time.
You must not forget your schoolbooks.
They want to get married.
Keep your eyes peeled!
My success is largely due to your help.
Neither of them cares for strenuous sports.
He gave me clothes as well as food.
I'd like to do that.
I lost my sunglasses.
I used to ride my bike to school, but now I take the bus.
This book is for you.
He must not live.
I'm not married anymore.
Was that a squirrel?
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
These aren't my keys.
Now fix that.
It's excruciatingly slow.
If I were you, I would stay quiet.
I just don't want to catch your cold.
I have a new camera I want you to see.
If he sends me any letters, I just tear them up and throw them away.
This school supplies students with textbooks.
The financial crisis has left many unemployed.
He is very stingy with his money.
You don't need to stand up.
We traveled around the world last year.
The seats are all sold out.
These trousers are too large.
According to the paper, it will snow tomorrow.
He has done many things for poor people.
The treaty did not ban nuclear tests under the ground.
I'm sorry that I didn't email you sooner.
Tell Tom that everyone is here.
We all agreed unanimously.
He writes a daily journal, and that inspired me to try doing the same thing, but in English.
They're in trouble.
That can't be legal.
We can't afford that.
I don't quite know what to say.
Why did you get so angry?
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
That's just what he needs.
How can you be so callous?
The plane should have arrived at Kansai Airport by now.
That's not the answer.
I'm not from here.
They fell into each other's arms.
He knows every inch of this area.
Be punctual.
I don't know what this means.
Would you be kind enough to explain it to me?
Let's get cracking!
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
You don't have to read the whole thing from beginning to end.
We haven't laid off any employees yet.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
They spent the entire day on the beach.
I ordered those books from Germany.
I'm just an average girl.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
I suppose you have the right to know.
You don't get up as early as your sister, do you?
I'd like to have a word with you.
I walked to school.
What happens if I press this button?
A burglar broke into my house while I was away on a trip.
You're powerful.
Any child could do that.
These are bad times.
I totally forgot.
I know you're just trying to help, and I appreciate that.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
Open the door.
We lost.
You look nervous.
I'm not done with you yet.
The telephone rang a few minutes later.
I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket.
I can't go with you.
Is the door open?
Tom never was ambitious.
Will you sing some English songs for us?
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
She seemed to have been ill.
He explained the facts at length.
This is your wine.
Television helps us widen our knowledge.
I said maybe.
I don't know what's wrong.
They will tear down the old building in two days.
If you want to talk, let's talk.
We're well on our way to making that happen.
Tom doesn't like to be contradicted.
I think Tom is scared.
She is really into knitting.
I did see something.
He's kind of cute, isn't he?
The show was very interesting. You should have seen it.
I followed the rules.
I don't know what to feed my dog.
She got very angry with the children.
We came back to camp before dark.
It is no use arguing with him.
You are the chosen one.
Don't take yourself so seriously.
It was just as I thought.
Drivers must observe the traffic rules.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
I entered someone else's room by mistake.
She asked him where he lived, but he was too smart to tell her.
He isn't able to buy a car.
Everybody likes him.
I am not happy.
We shared the cost of the meal.
I hope I didn't make a fool of myself.
It's dead.
Are you over your cold yet?
He wants you to come home.
When did you begin to learn English?
You need to sober up.
We drank some wine.
I think that will be all for today.
I never promised you anything.
Is that what you want me to say?
I didn't have much time.
Is he sleeping?
I think that Shintaro speaks English well.
He became a national hero.
Where did you grow up?
She doesn't get outdoors much.
We all know.
You'll have a rough time.
He ratted us out.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
I'll keep it a secret. Don't worry.
Can I touch your beard?
I'm fixing something.
Don't worry.
The fruit is similar to an orange in shape and to a pineapple in taste.
I saw him cross the street.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
I knew it wouldn't work.
He took a look at the newspaper before going to bed.
Is that so bad?
I thought you'd be alone.
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
He's never satisfied.
He commanded me to shut the gate.
What do you do to stay in shape?
I have to deal with this alone.
I really hope things work out for you.
Only girls' shoes are sold here.
That might change things.
The food was so good that I ate too much.
Tom sat on the window sill.
We can do it right now.
He will not be back tomorrow.
I'm smarter than you.
Don't drink anything.
This safe is for keeping valuables.
I think it's time for me to consider going on a diet.
Where do they come from?
You're overreacting.
Do you wear glasses?
How do you know so much about it?
I'll call you at seven.
Why did you want to speak with us?
Nobody's perfect.
She spent all afternoon cooking.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
It sounds good to me.
Are you going or staying?
Wash your hands.
She was kind enough to help me.
When did you first meet him?
I like astrology.
The sound of a gunshot echoed across the canyon.
I can't wait all day.
You're charming.
It's his word against hers.
I appreciate the thought.
What a loser!
He seems to be rich.
Thanks for the book.
It's all nonsense.
There is always something happening here.
If we were supposed to talk more than listen, we would have been given two mouths and one ear.
Where have you been all week?
He seems to have been ill.
He scolded her.
Please add my name to the list.
The concert will take place next Sunday.
Now you've mentioned it, I remember coming here with my parents when I was a child.
I found the field trip very educational.
I have to go soon because I left the engine running.
A moral person doesn't lie, cheat, or steal.
Leave my house.
She rode a camel.
How long did you stay?
Sometimes, you must fail before you succeed.
You made the same mistake as last time.
I guess that's OK.
Tom worries too much.
I hate to see you so miserable.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
It's not that long a flight.
Rain prevented us from taking a walk.
I admire your perseverance and determination.
Is it OK if we begin?
I feel silly.
She's not confident about the future.
Please fill out this form and wait for us to notify you.
Tom and Mary are older than John.
Can you still remember when we first met?
Did you hear that?
He thanked the host for the very enjoyable party.
Tom is starved.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
Do you know anyone who hums while they work?
The job must be finished by 3 p.m.
He was naive.
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
I'll always remember you.
Let me ask you a question.
You have to clean your room.
Nothing seemed to work.
I'm taking a vacation.
Do you know why?
He was beside himself with joy.
This poor cat almost died of hunger.
Tom wasn’t born rich.
Tom sat down next to Mary.
Don't you see what's going on?
I feel their pain.
Oh, don't be like that.
Keep trying.
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
Who is your teacher?
Would you be friends with me?
We're all infected.
Quit behaving like a kid.
She crouched down by the gate.
I don't care what you think.
Mary is going to help us tomorrow.
I said nothing of the sort.
He is absent because of illness.
He easily licked his opponent.
Are you aware that Okinawa is closer to China than to Honshu?
My grandmother looks after the children during the daytime.
Having a telephone helped her find more clients.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Who's your father?
She's waiting for you at home.
I feel really stupid.
She is as busy as a bee.
I couldn't make him understand my English.
Translate the underlined part.
I want to see you in your office in half an hour.
I thought you would understand.
I don't know when I'll be back.
I was born in 1972.
I'm not miserable.
He took pictures of me with his camera.
I want to know what you're doing here.
Please put on your shoes.
You're powerful.
You might be correct.
Look before you leap.
It's been a long time since I've written anything.
You're assertive.
You're the one that went crazy.
I washed it.
How hungry are you?
They were very confused.
I think we should all go to Tom's house.
I did so for the sake of my health.
She watched him draw a picture.
They were left speechless.
I must renew my passport.
Please bring me a clean knife.
Tom didn't drink much.
We need to get out of here.
Tom wasn't complaining.
You shouldn't have done it.
I asked Tom why he wanted to study French.
Tom jumped.
A watched pot never boils.
What exactly are we paying for?
You're very wise.
You're my princess.
You're free.
Part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience.
You have to come with me.
Have you told your parents?
It's not quite normal.
I'm really starting to get worried.
Best of luck to you.
I felt awkward around them.
She married him.
Stop the car now.
I'm happy here.
Don't point your finger at me.
You're the one who trained me.
Wood floats, but iron sinks.
I need to change my shirt.
I wrote her a letter every day.
We both love you.
I think it's time for me to buy a house.
I enjoy swimming.
I've never seen anything like it.
I'd like a shrimp cocktail.
Are you volunteering to help?
I'd like to own a business.
I can't figure out how to delete what I just posted.
You should have spoken more politely.
How are you going to manage?
Tom can be extremely dangerous.
Is it raining?
I'd like to rent a car.
We have no extra money.
I ran out of breath.
This book has many pictures.
Are you from around here?
He was voted prom king.
She doesn't live with him.
You've been very kind to me.
Just get out of here.
I have finished.
I've been away too long already.
We heard screams.
She did it easily.
He was walking in front of me.
Why are you bleeding?
Did your wish come true?
Tom is a decent sort of guy.
Rather than doing any good, the rain did a great deal of harm to the crop.
Her bicycle is blue.
What's the air temperature today?
What do you like about me?
I never did anything important.
You're such a flirt.
What kind of girl are you?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
Don't tell me what I can't do.
I have a lot of problems at the moment.
"Why don't you come?" "Because I don't want to."
Do you have any beer?
Don't drink the tap water.
She mistook my brother for me.
There's going to be a downpour.
The girl made off with her employer's money.
I don't mind waiting.
I can't wait to go.
I shouldn't have stayed up all night.
Come on in and sit down.
I can't help you because I am busy.
He is very angry.
No, thank you. I'm full.
Can't you hear all the car horns honking behind us?
He cannot be trusted.
What do you want to eat?
I can't think of any reason not to go.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
Are you here on holiday?
He was exposed to many dangers.
A famous architect built this house.
The old man has enough money.
Tom has been absent from school for three days.
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
Tom can run as fast as you.
I guarantee I'll get you a job.
Tom went there to meet Mary.
This is my house.
I don't care for him.
Summer has just begun.
I want to spend time with you.
What prevented him from coming?
There is no need to worry about shortages for the moment.
Those were the best years of my life.
Do I look like a policeman to you?
They shouldn't be doing that.
Can you see Tom?
I got your letter yesterday.
Is it a boy or a girl?
They're cannibals.
I got over my cold quickly.
Tom's thinking of moving so he'll be closer to Mary.
Get in the boat.
Do I look happy to you?
Anything else?
You can't both be right.
Are you losing weight?
He was driving the car at full speed.
Where's all this coming from?
Did you think I wouldn't tell Tom?
She is in a green dress.
Tom has a difficult job.
He doubts if I will keep my promise.
A swallow flies very swiftly.
I know you're not scared.
I don't normally do this.
What languages do you know?
I'm a real man.
I wonder if there'll be more snow this year than last year.
I had to see you.
I can't tell you yet.
Something's going on here.
"How are you doing?" "I'm doing okay."
Tom turned on the car radio.
I'll do anything you wish.
I want you to have a copy of this.
You don't want to see this, do you?
I felt excited.
Going back to South Africa had stirred up some painful memories for him.
We're sorry we can't help you.
She advised him not to do that.
Let's make it three o'clock.
He never asked me.
It will be very, very hot.
What would Tom need?
I can't imagine what you're going through.
I had a snack before I went back to work.
Look, I'll show you.
This makes me curious.
He closed the door suddenly.
You don't need to go there.
It can't be!
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
I let you down.
Tom found the problem.
She might come.
I looked away.
He wants only the best.
I am surprised to learn this.
The story was in all the papers.
I just feel so lost.
These are my sister's magazines.
He can speak Russian as well.
I will help you if you are in trouble.
What time did he get there?
I bought an umbrella.
Did you sleep all right?
I have some gifts for you.
She went to see him reluctantly.
That's what interests me.
She divided the cake into five pieces.
I want you to see this.
I returned to Japan.
I do the best I can.
Tom could sense something.
I have no insurance.
She substituted margarine for butter.
I eat here every day.
I figured I'd find you here.
They were not listening to music.
I'm just looking forward to going home.
Don't kid me!
You're no doctor.
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man.
I'm glad you brought that up.
Shall I get you a chair?
We have to figure out a way to get out of here alive.
Tom has some homework to do.
We know you're interested.
Is that a picture of me?
Does Tom still play the guitar?
I can't get back to sleep.
I'm adding the last touch.
Where are the other prisoners?
Tom believes that Mary is innocent.
Get on the horse.
How many cats do you have?
Her house is on the other side of the bridge.
A good lawyer would leave no stone unturned in his efforts to defend his client.
The older children helped the younger ones.
You can always text Tom.
He seldom, if ever, goes to the movies.
I can't leave.
They wear very little clothing.
We just got here.
I just keep finding excuses.
I think we should stop doing that.
A dog suddenly jumped at me.
Play us a tune.
I pointed my camera at her.
You drink too much coffee.
You should buy him new toys.
I'm not like the rest of these guys.
There are two cats sleeping on the bed.
I think you're funny.
There isn't anybody here.
His ambition is to be a lawyer.
I have to be in Boston in the morning.
Did I give you the tickets?
He was checking you out.
She must have seen better days.
I'm more interested in spoken English.
Were you looking at her legs?
I hope Tom feels better today.
You are fabulous.
His family emigrated to the United States.
I don't have any more ideas.
The leaves began to turn red and yellow.
I got up early this morning.
I was too tired to walk any more.
She was dressed in red.
How do you go there? By car?
I want you to go back.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
She misses her father.
I wasn't talking about Tom.
How did you come up with such a good idea?
You're very wise.
I go to the country every summer.
I gazed at the sea for hours.
Try to sleep.
How lovely!
I thought I was alone here.
Many of the workers died of hunger.
How was your summer?
She asked him to marry her.
I want to know what this is all about.
She advised him to come back at once.
She quickly went up the stairs.
Everybody loved Tom.
We are not going on vacation.
He looks well.
He is reasonable in his demands.
I saw him running.
What's worrying you?
I just don't understand what goes through the minds of people who troll forums.
Politicians never tell us their inner thoughts.
Give me what you have in your hand.
Don't open the present yet.
I'm flabbergasted.
I'm blessed.
You are the only one who can help me.
She bought him a camera.
I'm not turning back.
You may not be in the mood to hear this now, but I need to tell you something important.
I honestly don't care.
I had to pay five more dollars.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
You sound tired.
I thank you for that.
He stuck to his job.
None of them are present.
Some of them are my friends.
When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person.
I'd heard you'd changed.
It wasn't enough.
I saw him enter the store.
They accused him of telling a lie.
Tom reads to his daughter.
She has no manners.
I didn't see him.
You're the only one who can help me.
You should have told him.
Do you know what day it is today?
We're not involved.
The church is on the other side of the street.
She asked me to open the window.
There must be a logical explanation for this.
It is dangerous to fly in this heavy fog.
I will have lived here for ten years next month.
Bring the key.
He proceeded to the next question.
War is hell.
As far as I know, the novel is not translated into Japanese.
I don't get what the fuss is all about.
The Seine flows through Paris.
Japanese people tend to think that way.
Tom finally decided to try jumping over the stream.
The boy began to cry.
How do you think that makes me feel?
After I graduated from college, I spent two years traveling around the world.
We have to act quickly.
I'm going to go out this afternoon.
Do you like your hot chocolate?
We've all seen it.
I don't think you can beat me.
What are you going to do with that?
I suppose you want to ask me who I was with last night.
My mom doesn't want me to play with you.
Everyone changes.
When do you plan to check out?
He asked me out on a date.
A hammer was used to break the window.
I wonder what they're laughing about.
He misses his family very much.
She majored in history.
He wants to participate in the contest.
I've been promoted.
His short stature makes him feel insecure.
You don't need to hurry.
Germany shares a border with the Netherlands.
I really hope not.
My credit card was rejected by the ATM.
You're tough.
You're skinny.
Did I ask for your help?
Could I use your pencil?
I should've done this sooner.
I came with my friends.
A triathlon is a forbidding test of endurance.
She didn't want him to stay any longer.
Was that a squirrel?
I had a healthy breakfast.
In case of an emergency, push this button.
He took on extra workers.
I'm a little hurt.
I think there's been a mistake.
How did you get caught?
At last, we reached the summit.
He missed the last train.
Someone is playing the piano.
He never appears before nine o'clock.
She is all skin and bone.
Don't make a decision right now.
Have you been here all day?
Tom seldom eats seafood.
I want to stay in a hotel near the airport.
That is the worst thing you can do!
He'll come on foot or by bicycle.
It's not always possible to eat well when you are traveling in this part of the world.
The method was crude, but very effective.
I think we're going to be OK.
I expected you home an hour ago.
He told me his name was Tom.
I ran outside.
That was easier than I thought.
Let's try to solve the riddle.
He should atone for his sins.
The book was published in 1689.
What do I want to talk about?
I'll take good care of Tom.
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Please pick me up at the hotel at six o'clock.
You're my only real friend.
No sinner is ever saved after the first twenty minutes of a sermon.
You're turning thirty.
Tom isn't used to speaking in public.
It's right up your alley.
I don't feel like celebrating.
This is the doghouse that I made myself.
My brother is holding a camera in his hand.
Excuse me, what's the shortest route to the station?
Sorry, I can't stay for long.
This TV show is aimed at children.
She advised him to read more books.
He developed his own theory.
Let me call my lawyer.
She looked after her baby.
We're going east.
I constantly quarrel with my wife.
The boy is very honest.
She's being nice to me.
She likes talking best of all.
I've come this far, so I'll keep going.
She declared that she was not guilty.
Could you read this for me?
Where do you want it delivered?
I want to learn to sing like you.
Tom and Mary are really good friends.
As soon as I get to London, I'll drop you a line.
Milk doesn't mix with water.
He decided to give up smoking once and for all.
I have a lot of questions.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
We booked seats for the play.
I don't feel like drinking vodka.
I travel frequently.
That's all you need to know.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
You don't have to go.
Would you mind coming earlier next time?
I know your son.
Most of the plants died.
I'm not dumb.
It's self-explanatory.
You can't bury the truth.
Please sing.
I'm learning so much from you.
His office is on the eighth floor.
"How about a cup of coffee?" "I'd like to, but I have a previous engagement."
There's no need to be insulting.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
In her free time, she likes to be on the Internet.
I know him by name, but not by sight.
You need to focus on your strengths.
Don't you get bored when you're alone?
Frankly, I don't like your idea.
My father runs a restaurant.
Did I win?
If I could afford it, I would buy an electric car.
Your friends are late.
I came here to learn.
I demand satisfaction.
Don't I have some say in this?
Tom won first prize.
She moved out of her parents' house.
What is missing?
You can't pull it off.
Don't be so lazy.
One person more or less doesn't make much difference.
Does that count?
I don't believe you. You're always lying.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his key.
You can get rid of the cold if you take this medicine.
This is by far the most interesting of all his novels.
Thank you for the present.
Who would you like to speak to?
What a heavy bag!
I really am glad you're here.
The sky became darker and darker.
Someday you should give it a try.
Show me your tattoo.
He looks like a bug.
Hokkaido is located in the northern part of Japan.
Disneyland was very interesting. You should've come with us.
That can happen to anybody.
What's the matter with you?
It's ready.
I'm happy with that.
Why should we harm you?
I don't care as long as you are happy.
Who called you?
Spanish is spoken in twenty countries.
The heat's preventing me from sleeping.
I was born and raised here.
I promise I'll bring it right back.
I was too surprised to speak.
I'll never be able to play again.
Make sure to back up all your files.
I don't answer stupid questions.
I'll buy this desk for him.
I can feel it.
You are always complaining.
The police say they know you had an accomplice.
What does this word mean?
I tried to tell Tom, but he refused to listen.
Is that your real name?
I want to hear anything you have to say.
We can rest after lunch.
I like hot tea better than cold.
You won't have your way.
I guess I shouldn't have done that.
You said you had a theory.
What are you doing to stop this?
They wanted to win the war quickly and return to normal life.
Let's shake hands.
She smiled at him uneasily.
That made the problem all the more complicated.
Tom doesn't speak French at home.
It has an unpleasant taste.
I really needed it.
Do you think that any really smart person is inherently interested in languages?
He was angry because of what she said.
I think that's enough.
Take the garbage out.
I think this is going to work.
They're going to make mistakes.
I'm sure if you put your mind to it, you can do it.
When do you go on holiday?
Let me get back to you.
I asked for a seat in the no-smoking section.
My brother is still sleeping.
There's one thing I must tell you.
Could you turn the heat down, please?
Please take some of them.
Where did everybody go?
They should be fine.
You have to do as I say.
I wake up at six, but I don't get out of bed until seven.
If you can't come, you should let me know ahead of time.
We must punish him severely.
It didn't go well.
Regardless of what he does, he does it well.
I know what you mean.
A lot of foreigners visit Japan every year.
Thanks for the information.
I don't understand why this has to be done.
This work is simple enough that even a child can do it.
Is that one of ours?
You're not totally blameless.
You look very dignified.
My leg's gone to sleep, so I don't think I can stand up right away.
You have some books.
I know your type.
Tom helped again.
We survived.
Everyone seemed sad to see Tom go.
I never drink.
See you.
I need a little more time.
I forgot you were listening.
You are not supposed to smoke here.
That's probably not a good idea.
Is something wrong?
I lent my pencil to Tom.
Don't touch the flowers.
Stay positive.
This is a lot more fun than studying.
I don't drink much beer.
The public is clamoring for more jobs and lower taxes.
I use it.
She gave me a watch for a birthday present.
I do not believe in magic spells.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
He sat down to read a novel.
He judged it wiser to remain silent.
He's doing it right.
I never for a moment imagined that I would still be doing this kind of thing at my age.
I took part in the sporting event.
This is a book about stars.
Take a rest.
Where shall I wait for you?
They lived a happy life.
They're old.
I saw them kissing.
It is Paris that I want to visit.
I'll pack my bag.
I borrowed this comic from his sister.
May I call on you at your house tomorrow morning?
Tom's computer is not responding.
Would you care to come and see me on Saturday?
You can't change your mind now.
You should have seen me.
He is saving in order to buy a house.
It's easy to remember.
Here's my room.
Be sure to look over your paper again before you hand it in.
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my family?
What do you think I should pack for my trip?
I really don't want to be alone tonight.
You're in danger, Tom.
This is where you're wrong.
He arrived earlier than usual.
He is pleased with his new shoes.
Choose one person.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
What did she buy at that store?
Let me sleep.
How long did it take you to write this report?
You will receive a confirmation email after your account has been activated by an administrator.
Sunglasses protect our eyes from the sun.
Travel agencies' profits soared.
I want to be pampered.
You seem upset.
Everyone could easily see his disappointment.
I'm quite serious.
Did you hear it?
I recognized the name.
She hurried across the lawn.
Kiss me.
She has no enemies.
I memorized the poem.
She showed him several books that were on the shelf.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
The Confederate flag was lowered.
I don't think I'd like you as a friend.
I have been in Japan for two months.
I cried all morning.
Bring me something to eat.
I may swim in the river.
She gave me a watch.
He is no gentleman.
I hate these new boots.
She accidentally tore the page.
I guess it depends on the weather.
I refused to believe it.
She's got a point.
We were forced to work hard.
Are you saying you can't fix it?
Everyone cheered.
He arrived the day she left.
She has had to stay here.
Had he heard the news, he might have been shocked.
I need another one.
Why does it make you angry?
My father often washes the dishes.
As soon as I can afford it, I plan to travel around the world.
She stayed there for a moment.
You're disloyal.
This joke is not funny.
She advised him to go to the hospital, but he didn't follow her advice.
He nodded to me as he passed.
I'm observant.
I think you're just wasting your time.
She had a choice of going or remaining.
I think it's time for me to retire.
Why don't we go ahead and start the meeting?
I don't like people like Tom.
Call the cops.
Don't confuse astrology with astronomy.
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
The French president is to visit Japan next month.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
A lot of people would like to become famous. However, a lot of famous people wish they weren't so famous.
We're volunteering.
You would make a great mother.
I want to know the truth about my son's death.
How many different schools have you attended?
If you feed your dog properly, you can increase his lifespan.
The lake supplies the city with water.
I hate to eat alone.
I don't know when I'll have time to finish reading the rest of this book.
Do you know who they are?
I doubt this is anything you'd be interested in.
I plan to have lunch with him.
I met her on campus yesterday.
She didn't marry the man.
We believe in the existence of God.
I think he likes me.
Do you know what they're called?
To tell the truth, I do not like him.
I've found it.
Why are you torturing me?
You are no longer welcome here.
You have no choice.
How did you get over the difficulty?
Tom likes to cook Chinese food.
I haven't got a chance.
It's a matter of personal taste.
They were lucky.
The expedition's supplies soon gave out.
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
I don't think I want to answer any more of your questions right now.
He isn't back yet. He may have had an accident.
Please take care of yourself.
Tom is the one who woke me up.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
I don't know where Tom is.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
It's on my desk.
He will be at home tomorrow.
How long do you want it for?
I want you to consider this.
It's dark in here. Do you have a flashlight?
You're really annoying.
We're stunned.
How can I make him stop?
This is a very time-consuming task.
Could you turn on the light please?
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
He has left his family.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I thought a person like you would understand.
We don't control anything.
Spanish is her native language.
The living room adjoins the dining room.
Sit near here.
I figured you'd be impressed.
I'm still cooking the brown rice.
I like children. That's why I became a teacher.
She got very angry with her children.
Did you wash that?
Why did you come early?
Do you drink coffee?
Douglas finally agreed to talk with Lincoln.
I'm not good at public speaking.
They're sunbathing around the pool.
Why don't you want to wear a dress?
What do you want to do after you graduate?
He took poison by mistake.
Some believed his story, and others did not.
If you don't mind, may we inspect your suitcase?
By signing a contract, you agree to certain terms and conditions.
I love music, too.
He would like to take part in the competition.
I gave you fair warning.
I didn't expect that to come from you.
I didn't need to pay for the food.
I know it's a great opportunity.
Can you use a computer?
You must not behave like this.
She clearly does not mean it.
I'd like to open a savings account.
I'll put some coffee on.
You shouldn't prejudge people.
The burglar gained access to the house through a window.
He didn't look happy.
Don't talk about yourself like that.
Can you send the bellboy up?
We went to the theater early, so we could be sure that everyone could get a seat.
They refused to think of leaving.
The more you explain it, the more I don't understand it.
Tom calls Mary every night.
We resumed negotiations with that company.
She sat there silently with tears in her eyes.
He was knee deep in mud.
This book seems easy to me.
That's the best thing that could happen to me.
Two vanilla ice creams, please.
I don't think I could ever do this again.
It's very hard to get along with him.
He said his father was an architect and that he wanted to be one too.
Everybody knows the news.
A well is a place where you can get water.
Tom doesn't know who Mary is going to go to Boston with.
They missed the deadline.
A brass band is marching along the street.
You can park on either side of the street.
You're fussy.
I can't eat any more.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
If you're not listening to the radio, turn it off.
Are they still in bed?
From the top of that tall building, you can easily see the city.
Do you think I'm to blame?
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Tom died last year.
Is he still alive?
You have dirt under your fingernails.
Does this make me look fat?
I wish you would tell me what I ought to do in this difficult situation.
Tom isn't in a good mood today.
Do you mind if I take my shirt off?
Look at that mountain.
It's not gonna bite you.
I couldn't believe my eyes.
Everybody started cheering.
Tom says he'll only speak to Mary.
I listened, but I heard nothing.
He went to bed early.
Why don't you and I continue this discussion in private?
You sound really angry.
Punish the wicked and save the weak.
Her unexpected visit got him all worked up.
Grab hold of this.
How did you two meet?
Do you really think this is a good idea?
If no one has a better proposal, let's get to work.
I wasn't able to remember the title of that song.
We're coming.
How do you like your new job?
They paid separately.
He's a goal keeper.
What did you want to tell me?
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
You're not helping.
We took a cab.
The problem should be solved.
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day.
The old man sat down.
You were very busy, weren't you?
I'm always forgetting people's names.
Existing legislation does not take diversity of races into account.
Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
I figured you wouldn't come.
Come down here and eat with us.
Answer me.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
"May I use your dictionary?" "By all means."
What made you change your mind?
We don't have any proof.
Cosmetic surgery is not covered by most insurance plans.
How much money do you have?
I appreciate you being here.
I'm not at all surprised.
I think you should change your eating habits.
Is it important?
Are you on crack?
I mistook Tom for his brother.
I'll miss you so much.
I am an American.
I've saved the best for last.
I think she's hiding something.
What are you going to do next?
They are proud of their clever son.
See what happens when you tell the truth?
Your answer is correct.
I tried.
I just don't want your dog in my house.
Do you hate me?
Loosen up.
We have to move.
Are your eyes bad?
I'm glad you met Tom.
I thought we could use the cloth napkins.
Don't give in to peer pressure.
Tom watched Mary dance.
Say hello.
We spoke briefly.
This time I will try it.
I almost forgot my passport.
Red wine, please.
He jumped over a ditch.
You may use my new car.
I agree with you.
Did you like it?
That's the way I like it.
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight.
They sell various kinds of goods at that store.
To try to bring it back would be foolish.
Tom's body will be cremated.
Science has brought about many changes in our lives.
Bring me my cane.
Ancient coins were found inside the mysterious tomb.
Well done!
He had a dog.
I recognize that what he says is the truth.
That one is all yours.
This is an unexpected surprise.
Have you even heard a word I've said?
If you want to succeed, use your time well.
You've got my helmet.
This lady is Indian.
Father can swim, but Mother cannot.
Tom is really proud of Mary.
Get in the car now.
I thought you knew.
Call me at six-thirty, please.
Can you make yourself understood in Japanese?
This no longer matters.
How's your kid doing?
He lives in a gated community.
He studies ten hours a day on average.
He stared at that detailed miniature model of a dinosaur.
Are you going there on business?
Mary told me that she was glad to see me.
I brought that back from Australia.
Your cat is fat.
This is yours.
She's a really nice girl.
Can I use your toilet, please?
I will give you what help I can.
Give me something I can cut this with.
Do you agree?
I had a toothache yesterday.
This movie is so terrible it's hilarious.
Please do whatever you think is necessary.
I went outside early in the morning.
They weren't able to discover any secrets.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
The king once lived in that palace.
This store sells old books.
It's not worth the effort.
He put the luggage down.
Why don't you take off?
I knew Tom would accept my invitation.
I'm pleased with his performance.
I'm powerful.
I thought he wouldn't come.
I'm stuck in my job.
Maybe we can fix it.
I don't understand a word of what he says.
Everybody's so busy.
If necessary, I will come soon.
Even his servants despised him.
She greeted him cheerfully.
He is a good loser.
I'm afraid he will never admit his guilt.
I really like being with you.
I like seeing you this way.
I will have to help them.
The teacher taught them that the earth is round.
You're outgoing.
What do I care?
That's what you think.
There isn't much wind today.
I sat down next to him.
How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
Mary is knitting Tom a scarf.
I paid him on the spot for his work.
He finds fault with everything.
Tom was nervous.
My physician advised me to refrain from alcohol for the time being.
When he was in the military, he conformed to the strict army rules.
Please step inside.
I'll continue to offer advice.
Are you pleased with your new job?
Did you want anything else?
He is in danger of losing his position unless he works harder.
You're foolish.
No one knew who did it.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
My bag was stolen.
Are you old enough to vote?
I know the perfect place for our party.
Tom is at school.
That was some pretty good advice.
She's a violinist of some renown.
I don't know how I did it. What's important is that I did it.
Don't you have anything else?
You have changed since I saw you last year.
I want you to go to Boston.
She's most happy when she's at home.
He is confident of his ability.
I'll wait till noon.
It was believed that the sun went around the earth.

I have already eaten lunch.
He knows about the modern history of France.
He is preparing for the test.
I can't drink any more beer.
I don't need a ride.
Here comes Tom.
I'm just writing a letter to my girlfriend.
I couldn't live with that kind of uncertainty.
French is a very interesting language.
Why are girls so complicated?
We certainly hope not.
Why don't you take a seat here?
You said you were happy.
We found something.
Tom let us go.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?

They never gave up.
That house belongs to me.
Why can't I see you?
Can you remember anything?
I hope you will have a good time in Europe.
Why did he fail in business?
I like music very much.
I owe what I am today to my father.
It's up to you and me.
I can't live without a TV.
I guess I just don't get it.
He's a slacker.

I don't want to do it again.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
What number should I call in case of an emergency?
Come back here.
Do you think she's pretty?
That perfume smells good.
There's nothing to be scared of.
The apples he sent to me were delicious.
I have nothing to report so far.
Tom felt invincible.
A putrid smell came up out of the hole in the ground.
Don't move!
We packed everything.
You should have left half an hour earlier.
I'm dreading the exam.
Generally speaking, men are taller than women.
Everything matters.

As for me, I like chicken better than pork.
That almost made me laugh.

I have nothing to say to you.
I begged her not to go.
Don't forget to floss.
I can't do this by myself.
I want to know where they are.
We can't do everything.
Is this seat taken?
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
Could you send this letter to Japan?
I explained the process to him.
You're very skeptical.
We thought he was an American.

She stabbed him in the back.

How about going out for dinner?

OK, I think I get it.
I have kept a diary for three years.
He's the cutest boy in town.
Have another drink.
You were very busy, weren't you?
The teacher asked me a difficult question.
I was scared, of course.
I grew up in a small town.
I made no promises.
I had no other choice but to take him at his word.
It was such a nice day.
My day ends at 5 o'clock.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
Are they students?
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
Are you ready to go?
For all her riches, she's not happy.
I've decided that we won't go.
He always troubles himself about minor things.
I'm stubborn.
I thought you might want to know.
I know that there was a big church here.
I won't back down.
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.

Stuff happens.
You came in late.
I rarely watch documentaries.
These kittens are so cute and cuddly.
I don't even know you.
I wonder if you are truly happy.
I do sympathize with you.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
Our plans fell through at the last minute.
You're forgetful.

He's out of position.
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?

It's about time.
Tom was in Boston last month.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
Sooner or later, his luck will run out.
We have little money available for the research.
Have you eaten lunch yet?
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.

I don't have time to argue with you.
I've finished reading the book.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
I can't believe he renounced his U.S. citizenship.
Listen, all of you.
I can look at it when you're ready.
Few people think so.
You ruined my life.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
Can we fix this?
The job offer still stands.
I'm skinny.
That comes in handy.

He invited me to a party.
I hate them all.
He wrote to me from time to time.
You have been warned.

You just wouldn't understand.

It's like being in a candy shop.
They all looked relieved.
Whose turn is it next?
I'd rather walk.
You really don't get it, do you?
I didn't tell anyone what time I'd be arriving.
I just wanted you to accept me.
You don't have the right.
Go back to work.
I only have one so far.
I don't wish to interfere.

You're working hard.
I regret having told you.
He's watching me.
Be yourself.
Who says Tom knew?
I love hanging out with you.
Which is the most difficult language in the world?

I've never felt better in my life.
A coke, please.
I don't have the authority.

It's not logical.
He has a camera.
When I heard that song, it reminded me of my childhood.
I'm here to do what I can.
Stop deluding yourself.
I cannot stop the bleeding.
Tom doesn't like living alone.
Your team is stronger than ours.
Life is full of surprises.
Be a man.
My brother and I were very close.
I have three times as much money as you.
You can't believe anybody.
Are you retarded or something?
She seems rich.
I can't wait for school to start.
He is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be sure.
Don't you think I know what people say about me?
Why don't you tell me what you want to hear?
I'll get back to you.
I don't have all night.
You're one of them, aren't you?
I disagree with you on this.
Tom is a player.
Would you like some water?
I gave you fair warning.
Well done!
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
She requested help, but no one came.
I didn't hear it.
I don't need your praise.
You're still mad, aren't you?
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
I felt scared.
Aren't you the one who's always saying we should spend more time together?
She can't bear the noise.
Is it all necessary?
He was too tired to go any farther.
There are no problems.
What shall we do?
You should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.
You had better go now.
We have had few typhoons this autumn.
I'd like to ask you about how to do that.
You're much prettier than I remember.
We waste a lot of time.
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
We need to protect ourselves.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow.
No one could find the cave.
My computer was down yesterday.
I want to discuss this with your manager.
Christmas is soon, isn't it?
I want my money back and I want it back now.
I think something scared Tom.
We had fun with them.
She loves Tom more than she loves me.
It's not healthy for you.
They don't talk at all.
She is a self-educated woman.
No pain, no gain.
Tom showed up at just the right moment.
He broke his word.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
Why won't my dog eat dog food?
Are you afraid of that?
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
I do not like music.
Do you mind if I open the window?
I would like to call on you one of these days.
Tom helped Mary dye her hair.
This room is very small, so it is impossible to put more furniture in it.
Be polite, but firm.
I don't know when I should come.
He's demented.
I'd like to get married to someone like you.
He accepted reluctantly.
I can't do this job alone.
I trust him.
He doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
I think I'm ready to leave.
I am never at home on Sundays.
See what happens when you give people advice?
You're very wise.
Would you please tell this gentleman who I am?
We drove through village after village, until we got to our destination.
Now I'm serious.
It's not a good car, but it's still a car.
I really don't want to go.
We'll try to be more careful the next time.
We have medicine for you.
Tom took a bad fall.
Did you like the movie?
Such incidents are quite common.
You said you didn't understand.
Actually, I've never seen one.
I want to know where they are.
I saw Tom three hours ago.
I want my dinner brought to my room.
You know I have no choice, don't you?
How long will it take?
He is familiar with Japanese culture.
Why don't you talk to me now?
We both love you.
I'm no friend of yours.
There was a drop in temperature after the rain.
It's a pity that you couldn't come.
Be kind to those around you.
I don't know that much about you.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
She suggested that he try it.
He lives in the suburbs of London.
How many people are here today?
Do you live in the city?
Is there anyone in the room?
Your car has a broken taillight.
Where were you yesterday?
I can't live without you.
Tom wants Mary to keep him company.
Just do what you have to do.
How are we going to find Tom?
I don't feel so good.
You must be exhausted.
Tom wasn't the first person here.
He knows how to play the piano.
I can't stand reptiles.
Have you ever tried to think about nothing?
Have you been told where to park your car?
You're fascinating.
I had to stay in bed for a while.
Ask anyone.
I appreciate it.
My father was a teacher.
I will never forgive him.
I feel perfectly fine.
They feared you.
I was at home almost all day yesterday.
How many pieces of baggage do you have?
The old couple gave him up for lost.
I'll get this.
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
Are you closer to your mother or to your father?
Are you on dope?
She is a typist.
Chivalry isn't dead.
Was that a squirrel?
A good teacher must be patient with his pupils.
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Tom is in reasonably good health.
You'd be amazed how much time Tom spends playing games.
Can I borrow a pen? Mine's on its last legs.
The light faded out.
I saw you outside.
For further information, see page 16.
I don't even know why.
You're careful.
They're mine.
I'm home all the time.
I was almost right.
Why not just call the police?
I think he's competent.
What are you doing in my office?
I will show you some.
I did my homework.
I'm a little out of practice.
I can't believe you're eating what the doctor told you not to eat.
I don't know who they are, but they don't look friendly.
Never in his life had he encountered such a dilemma.
I drank three cups of coffee this morning.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
By the way, what's your address?
Don't tell me to go home.
Go and help wash the dishes.
It wasn't Tom's idea. It was mine.
Does anyone feel sick?
I just want to know one thing.
I have hardly any money with me.
You're not aiming high enough.
Everything is broken.
It may rain at any time.
I don't need a bed.
The dogs howled at the full moon.
It's my duty to help you.
Don't worry. Everything's OK.
I wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
I gave some of my old clothes to the Salvation Army.
Tom took the easy way out.
I amused myself.
Let's sit here for a while and look at the view.
Everyone can't afford a car.
Where's convenient for you?
She told him that she loved him.
The airplane took off on time.
Tom came back an hour later.
I am supposed to go to Tokyo next week.
Are you dating anybody?
I'm not in any pain.
You're good.
He'll wait for you.
Have you finished reading the book?
It's very hard to play Vivaldi's bassoon concerto on the saxophone.
It's not how much you know, but what you can do that counts.
Many foreigners speak good Japanese.
I'm waiting for a very important call.
Someone has taken my shoes by mistake.
He is a fast runner.
It's just that I don't like it.
Your problem is you don't study enough.
Can computers actually translate literary works?
She advised him to exercise.
He directed all his energy to his business.
That's my affair.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
All in all, we had a good time at the party.
I was bored with his speech.
I don't have any time to watch TV.
Do you have the painting?
Try and stop me.
Be careful not to slip.
I want more information.
I'm attentive.
Is that another joke?
It was very ugly.
Tom loves playing old computer games.
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
I saved you.
Cats are nocturnal animals.
Is it always like this?
I don't want to watch television this evening.
Because my mother was ill, I could not go there.
Thanks a lot.
I expect you to work harder.
I think you should swim.
You're fearless.
My mother is always busy.
She revealed the secret to him.
Be nicer to your brother.
The rest of them will come soon.
Many friends came to see me off.
After dinner, bring your guitar along and we'll sing.
My English teacher recommended that I read these books.
God, you're beautiful.
No one knows the reason.
I really like being with you.
I guess I was mistaken.
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
I don't even think about it anymore.
There is snow on the mountain.
We might die.
What is my room number?
Go ahead.
Laughter is like a windshield wiper. It can't stop the rain, but it lets you move ahead.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
Am I stupid?
In time he'll come to see the error of his ways.
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
The village needs your help.
Be kind to those around you.
Forget about that right now.
Who were you dreaming about?
I will shoot him.
Are we leaving soon?
You're early.
You are big.
You're not sick.
I'll be back before you know it.
I hope that your brother is better.
Please take a look at that picture.
You're kind.
I find it strange that she hasn't arrived yet.
It was bitterly cold outside.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
Have you got any plans?
I can't believe how stupid I was.
She defeated him.
She asked him why he was crying.
When shall I return the book?
I want to learn to speak Hawaiian, so I can impress my girlfriend.
Tom will probably win.
It's obvious that you're wrong.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
I thought I was alone.
I want to hear you say it.
How many different pieces are there in Japanese chess?
Tom said my plan wouldn't work.
I'm glad you decided to come.
It occurred to him that he should start at once.
Tom arrived first.
She began to sweat.
How long have you known about this?
When was the last time you went to an art gallery?
I don't tell people what to eat.
I'm old enough.
What relieves the pain?
I hate to put you through this.
Let's end all this bickering.
We're all being manipulated.
Dancing is not a crime.
What will the neighbors think?
These paintings are beautiful.
I have nothing in particular to say about this problem.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't busy last week.
Everybody thinks I'm dead.
You can't accomplish anything without taking a risk.
I'm intrigued.
You know I have to go.
I knew my time would come.
Tom was so hungry that he ate dog food.
I'm getting married next week.
Is college worth it?
No one can say.
Don't drink that.
I think you panicked.
He had barely enough to eat.
Is English harder than Japanese?
It's thirty degrees below zero.
She bought a toy for the kid.
Maybe we should go to Boston next summer.
Do you know where he bought his camera?
It's not that big of a deal.
Tom didn't respond right away.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
There's a cat in my house.
It's all I know.
Tom dreams of owning a house in the center of Boston.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
The water flows under the bridge.
It seems that the rainy season has set in.
She seems to have a tendency to exaggerate things.
I want to know who told you that.
You don't have to be so rude.
This is the house where that poet lived when he was a child.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
What's going on?
The detective shadowed the suspect for four blocks.
I'm grounded.
They're all lying.
Everything that Tom said is true.
I found it difficult to get along with him.
Lightning struck the tower.
How long is the bridge?
Don't judge me.
Do you have psychic powers?
He is my friend.
A screen divided the room into two.
I can comfort her.
Police cordoned off the crime scene.
Bless you.
If my brother hadn't helped me, I would've drowned.
I never dreamed of there being such a quiet place in this noisy city.
Take care of it.
What's Japan's longest river?
I never went back.
I'd like to be more than just friends.
In case the shipment is delayed, we have special delay insurance.
When did you hear the sound?
You're impressed, aren't you?
I don't like this place.
What activity do you spend most of your time doing?
I could've objected, but I didn't.
I found my father's diary which he kept for 30 years.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
Being with you makes me feel happy.
The soldiers lost the courage to fight.
You're very stylish.
I forgot.
The picture of the accident makes me sick.
Show me what's in your pocket.
I didn't even know that my car had been stolen.
Give me a couple minutes to get dressed.
Please explain the rule to me.
We're just students.
I'm very tired.
I ordered you a drink.
Should I ask him out?
Schools are expected to meet the needs of every child, regardless of ability.
Do you think it'll fit?
This house is not for sale.
The war has taken a terrible toll on the civilian population.
Can you tell us about it?
A few days' rest will do you good.
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius.
I wish you had not told the story to my mother.
Why didn't you come?
How come I've never seen you here before?
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
Is that why you called?
Did you see my camera?
I have nothing to do today.
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I didn't leave the door open.
Who's screaming?
I had a stroke.
You don't seem convinced.
I'm sloshed.
Tom can be relied on.
They say he's sick.
You can't hurt my feelings.
You can't tell anyone about this.
We could've done better.
There's something I have to ask you.
Be more flexible.
How did you get hurt?
The rumor was completely without foundation.
I picked you some flowers.
I didn't want you to read that.
I guess we're not invited.
How soon can you get to my house?
I don't feel like trying.
Which wine goes best with red meat?
No one really cares.
You're too stupid to live.
Drop me a line when you get there.
Bigger is not always better.
I opened the window to let in some fresh air.
Which floor do you live on?
I want life to be the way it was before.
I beg you to stay.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
You ought not to miss it.
We agreed on a price.
Tom has departed for Australia.
They were plainly dressed.
Let's not waste time.
I don't like your suggestion.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
What he said surprised me.
Not everyone believed this plan was a good one.
Our school was reduced to ashes.
The professor gave a lecture on the Middle East.
The only one who enjoys a crowded subway car is a pickpocket.
I'll never see you again.
You're perfectly right.
He is less patient than his brother.
I'm familiar with the subject.
She sometimes takes a walk in the park.
I don't understand this word.
He seems to be happy.
I don't mind getting up at six.
He's been passing off my ideas as his.
This isn't too hard for you, is it?
I want to drink a cup of tea.
He's just trying to be popular.
Were you busy?
He looks confused.
No one agreed with me.
You're too weak.
The problem with many things is the pre-conceived ideas we have about them!
This is a great theory.
She advised him to walk instead of taking a bus.
He must be very happy.
Anybody knows it.
The cup is full.
How about going for a drive?
Better a little than nothing.
Keep on smiling.
It's a lot of fun to be with you.
He had little experience with international issues.
This is very useful.
Thanks for saving me.
Where shall we eat tonight?
I can't wait till summer.
I don't want Tom to see that.
I heard her sing a song.
This bus is going to Minsk.
You should listen to me.
Tom persuaded Mary to go to the party with him.
The urban-renewal project is now well under way.
Everyone is happy.
Are you still married?
Stop. That tickles.
He gave me his phone number.
Tears rolled down his cheeks.
I'd like to study in Paris.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
I need to finish reading my book.
She's wearing a great-looking hat.
You're disloyal.
There are only five minutes left till the train leaves and she hasn't appeared.
We can't live without oxygen.
My grandfather is very hard to please.
They're all thieves.
We are going to have a baby.
She looked as if she had seen a ghost.
Do you know who painted this picture?
If you are a parent, don't allow yourself to set your heart on any particular line of work for your children.
You seem to know everything about this.
Do you plan to buy that car?
We're dating.
That is a pencil.
At first, I thought he was your brother.
I never believed it.
Give me a minute.
The pharmacy isn't far from the hospital.
Bring a date.
Tom needs us to show him the way.
Do you have time?
I live in a small fishing village.
You're creative.
I corrected it.
I hadn't expected anyone to be home.
A dog bit her leg.
There's so much I want to show you.
Where's the map?
I didn't want to die.
You don't deserve to live.
Tom eats the same food every day.
I can't sleep when I'm stressed out.
He works a lot.
What did you do then?
If I had my way, you would all be fired.
He told us to depart at once.
Why did the police arrest Tom?
We hope to see you again.
Bring me a piece of chalk.
I can buy one.
She thought she could get him to like her.
I believe that he is innocent.
I did nothing illegal.
Please go on with your dinner.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
Do you have a husband?
I haven't heard from Tom in a year.
Unfortunately he refused to come.
I guess we'll never know.
Life is like a game of chess.
My cousin is hooked on smack.
He opened the door.
All hope is gone.
You're very upset.
Do seedless watermelons exist?
I thought you'd understand.
He approached the door.
We're getting out of here. The storm is coming.
He is subject to fits of anger.
She is no stranger to me.
What evidence do you have?
You don't have to go.
This is the person I talked about the other day.
Leave us.
Granting that favor is out of the question.
She laid her head down on the pillow.
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
I went to Tom's apartment.
Did he ask you to spy on me?
I don't doubt your intentions.
The dog house is outside.
Keep oil away from the fire.
It happened to someone I know.
He advised us against doing it.
We have faith in Tom.
Come back soon.
Sing a song with me.
Are you really a princess?
I just wish I could contribute more money.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
Ten to one, he will succeed.
I know that I calculated the bill correctly.
I get hives when I eat eggs.
I dislike speaking in public.
I want to stay with you.
Do you know his father?
I have two daughters.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
I'll finish it in one hour.
We associate the name of Einstein with the theory of relativity.
Fake it till you make it.
He is here!
He's the new CEO from the parent company in France.
I'll see you a week from today.
Have you ever been betrayed by a good friend?
It cost a lot of money to repair the car.
She accused me of being a liar.
I'll be with you in five minutes.
I don't want you to do that, Tom.
He broke up the chair for firewood.
You need to exercise more.
We don't say that anymore.
I have four sisters and one brother.
I just don't like football.
I advise you to be punctual.
Tom was scared to death.
Now what's the deal?
The days are getting longer.
You're lost.
May I use your toilet?
Just mind your own business, please.
Tom advised Mary not to believe everything she reads on the Web.
We went to the video store.
We looked, but saw nothing.
Tom wants to come.
Tom paid no attention to Mary's warning.
You're taller than I am.
Choose something.
I want to deposit some money.
Isn't it black?
Please keep me informed.
That's very odd.
Did you meet someone else?
I called her up.
I'll show you where it is.
Tom is learning to swim.
We competed with each other for the prize.
I have plenty of friends.
The evening meal is served between 9 and 12.
Write a poem with four three-line stanzas.
I got tired with the work.
You seem to know everything about this.
That man is unworthy of you.
Tom couldn't finish his dinner.
He studied the way birds fly.
You're a prisoner.
Would you teach me?
If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold.
May I open a can?
Have you ever been to Kyushu?
I guess you want me to leave.
My grade is above the average.
May I have everyone's attention, please?
I don't know why you did it.
Do you know why he put off his departure?
I'd like to see the car before I rent it.
You won't need me.
You're not as good as you think you are.
I promise I'll try.
She is appreciated by everyone.
Is everybody ready?
The effect was immediate.
My wife is throwing a baby shower for her best friend.
I got caught.
I want them alive.
I can't reach it.
I'm left-handed.
She managed to keep up appearances.
I can't come up with a good excuse for being late for the dentist.
Why are you even here?
Write it down before you forget it.
My school has a band.
I always have trouble remembering names.
She is paralyzed in both legs.
You won't die today.
Can I borrow your pen for a few minutes?
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
How much have you made tonight?
Hey, guys. What's up?
In any case I just want to make clear that the fact that these are not normal people.
Be kind to old people.
I'm undressing.
I must get a new suit made.
I didn't buy the car.
I can't fall asleep.
You can't carry on like this.
Commit these words to memory.
Our work never ends.
You're very nice.
Have you ever read a book in French?
I will pick you up around six.
Don't tell anyone.
We're not happy.
After she lost her job, she couldn't afford to feed her dogs, so she gave them away.
Grab as much as you need.
I don't know what you do.
I want you to get some rest.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
Keep your gun handy.
I feel lucky to have been chosen.
Do you own research.
The party ended at midnight.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
I want you to think about this.
I'm not blaming you.
Tom is a bit paranoid.
Did Tom go alone?
I think Tom stole my bicycle.
I just don't feel like doing that tonight.
She could not understand the whole story.
The train is always on time.
It's warm for this time of year.
Employees are prohibited from watching the Olympics.
I will choose one.
One stayed and the other went away.
You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?
Follow the rules.
Scream as loud as you can.
I thought Tom said it was a dog.
I have no reason to lie to you.
I want to stay alive.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Language is the means by which people communicate with others.
Tom deserves a vacation.
How's your new apartment?
She said something to him.
Her only desire is to see him again soon.
Please remember to mail this letter.
Everything's going be all right.
There's no way I'm going to do that.
She told him a joke, but he didn't think it was funny.
No one could see us.
He is out of circulation these days.
You can count on Tom.
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
We must make up for lost time.
Don't I even get an explanation?
It doesn't get any better than this.
Ten years have gone by.
Tom wanted to be a farmer.
I don't want to marry you.
How's the job hunt?
Quit acting like a baby.
I told them they shouldn't move.
Honesty is the best policy.
Call me if anything happens.
He got on the train.
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.
I'm living in the city.
This is your fate.
We bought some tennis balls.
The dog is panting.
What I told you about him also holds true for his brother.
Things aren't always as they appear.
I think you did great.
I called home.
I'm sorry, I don't buzz in people I don't know.
She looked at him angrily.
He will come back to Japan in the middle of May.
I love that shirt.
I love cooking.
I've heard of you.
African elephants have bigger ears than Asian elephants.
I don't think he is fit for the job.
I just can't take it.
How many of you are going?
Does this medicine work quickly?
Why don't we go out and get drunk?
The movie was so sad that everybody cried.
I've been very busy since I returned from abroad.
Put some clothes on.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
We offer low-cost prefabricated houses.
Few students could understand what he said.
There is no factory in this village.
You shouldn't visit my grandfather today.
I don't remember where you live.
Her family is very large.
We're not really brothers.
She made me so angry on the telephone that I hung up on her.
He banged his head.
We played on the beach.
Did you enjoy the movie?
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
You're very skeptical.
Don't pull the plug yet.
Tom saw Mary trying to escape.
I can prove it to you.
It's all happening so fast.
Tom is still young.
Look forward, please.
I gave up my job.
You must've thought I was an idiot.
When did the Thirty Years' War take place?
Ignore Tom's request.
If the university doesn't have enough students, the administration will cancel the class.
Where do we start?
I shouldn't have sold my car.
He waited his turn.
The sum of all the angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees.
I'm pretty sure Tom's reliable.
Drop it!
He felt the same way as I did.
Where did they learn this?
They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
Why are you busy today?
Make yourselves comfortable.
Can you still remember where we first met?
Do you play tennis?
Death is preferable to dishonor.
I don't see how that could be possible.
Where do you want to go?
I grew up around here.
This was a gift from Tom.
I've been badly bitten by mosquitoes.
My brother is an idiot.
According to our teacher, she entered the hospital.
I think it's OK.
If you were able to go camping with us, I think we'd all have fun.
He is good at singing.
He was very happy.
There was no question about that.
Children should obey their parents.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
What do you love? What do you hate?
There are many earthquakes in Japan.
Accidents happen.
Please hurry up!
Tom was wearing a bulletproof vest, so the bullet didn't kill him.
The Mona Lisa has an enigmatic smile.
I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.
There's no exit.
I want everyone to be there.
His family is very large.
I will go and take a look at the house.
This wall is cold.
I hid it in my sock drawer.
I finally found the solution to the problem.
Did he go there?
I didn't get even one letter from her.
Can you read that sign ahead of us?
Tom is packing.
I think Tom needs your help.
Tom abandoned his family.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
The tea is too strong. Add some water.
I think it's cruel to keep a cat inside.
We are subject to the laws of nature.
Do you believe in miracles?
I wanted to go outside and get a breath of fresh air.
Why don't you play something for me?
This word means several different things.
I can't catch my breath.
I'll go home.
Have another cup of coffee.
We're out of stock.
I didn't mean to keep it secret.
You don't have the time.
I left my umbrella at home.
I don't remember anything.
You must meet with him.
I work in this building.
I live in a rural area.
If you had taken my advice, you wouldn't be in such trouble.
Your ideas are different from mine.
I just smiled.
I just want to let you know that I won't let you down.
She has good handwriting.
Tom wanted to protect himself.
You keep on making the same mistake time after time.
Where are your parents?
When I told him that, he got furious.
She is very bitter toward me.
What's your favorite wine?
Is there another word for synonym?
This doesn't feel right.
When did you arrive?
You may go.
I can't believe I just shot myself.
No matter what you say, I don't think Tom is a nice guy.
Tom has begun to look for work.
Are those my earrings?
Are you going to take part in the contest?
I bought a pair of gloves.
That is the fastest train in the world.
I saw the movie.
We don't want them to be uncomfortable.
I think it's time we made some changes.
I want to take you to lunch.
We waited anxiously.
My hobby is reading novels.
The reason for this is plain.
Solar energy is a new source of energy.
I asked her to pick me up around four.
Girls are crazy.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Who are these people?
Tom drank a glass of wine.
It will be hot tomorrow.
Tom thinks Mary doesn't get enough sleep.
Nothing unexpected happened.
They're still together.
This is for internal use.
That tastes terrible.
It was raining hard, but she insisted on going for a drive.
Try not to laugh.
He's spending too much time watching TV.
He is the tallest boy.
He hammered at the window.
I'll eat here.
Which one of those is yours?
Don't try this at home.
I want to write a book.
You're such a liar.
One is red and the other is white.
I don't like you anymore.
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
I suggest you do your job and let me do mine.
When do we arrive?
I think life is what you make it.
I'm being sensible.
I'd like to sit here for a while.
I couldn't put up with her arrogant behavior.
Anything the group decides is OK is fine with me.
Do you think I can use my cellphone in the shower?
Would you be so kind as to lend me your book?
That has nothing to do with it.
I want you to be quiet.
I lost my key somewhere around here.
Even I can't believe that.
If you act like that, he'll think you hate him.
Let me get that for you.
Do you think it's wise to wear your uniform today?
That's upsetting.
It never happened.
They would prefer that we wait.
You know we'd never hurt you.
I need to borrow your car.
I just guessed.
You're young.
I don't see how that could be possible.
We were impressed.
What are your measurements?
I really misjudged you.
Everyone started clapping.
Just say no.
Please open the window.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
A monkey is climbing up a tall tree.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
I like the way you think.
Don't be so shy.
Don't be such a fool.
English is not spoken here.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
What happened at that intersection?
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
No one's in sight.
She leaned on his shoulder.
He goes abroad every year.
Who are you waiting for?
I love the way you kiss.
I have a pair of red shoes.
Stop worrying about that.
The robber was nabbed this morning.
This sounds about right.
You idiot!
Are you with someone?
Everybody was anxious to know what had happened.
He solved all the problems.
How did the traffic accident happen?
Getting up at 6 a.m. was hard at first, but now I'm used to it.
He did well in all subjects, particularly mathematics.
I haven't seen anything of him lately.
You're preaching to the choir.
This is a dog.
Who's that boy?
There's no membership fee for joining.
Tom is at his desk writing something.
That's not how it is.
I was thinking of getting one.
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long.
I did all I could.
Are you ready to order?
I didn't get even one letter from her.
I slept with my clothes on.
He was delighted to know I had passed the exam.
My eyes are sore.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
What is your name?
What's all this noise?
Nice timing.
What time are you coming back?
You gotta get more organized.
A conservative tie is preferable to a loud one for a job interview.
I only wish I were able to help.
I find you intriguing.
You're not going fast enough.
I have to leave now.
Tom isn't strong.
Why do Americans eat turkey on Thanksgiving?
They armed themselves with rifles.
We shared everything.
How can this be done?
Tom just confessed.
He's already left.
She availed herself of every opportunity.
I bought it for about twelve dollars.
You'd better try to assert yourself more.
It's no trouble at all.
We'll obey.
I'm looking forward to the next time.
I gave orders I was to be left alone.
I fell in the pool.
I want you to tell me why you did that.
Don't push me!
She put on her overcoat before going out.
You have been warned.
He said that I must go.
Is he correct?
He continued the experiment.
What a heel!
I visit him every other day.
Who notified you?
Can I take a day off?
What a fool I was to lend him the money.
Unless it's something fairly impressive, I won't remember it.
It's to your left.
Staying home isn't fun.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
He came from another country.
She loves antiques.
I won again.
I only saw him once.
As far as I know, she is a very good person.
I've got nowhere to go.
You shouldn't pop your bubble gum in class.
He called off the trip.
Let's begin, then.
The doctor advised me to give up smoking.
I'm anxious whether I'll do well at this new job.
I forgot the map.
The plants suffered damage from the frost.
Stand up straight.
Turn on the lights.
I figured I might find you here.
You should have been more careful with your health.
I can't stand that noise.
I'm no friend of yours.
It's fine today.
Tom's been going through a rough patch lately.
Why are you even here?
You really speak French well.
He won't make it to old age.
She always says nice things about him.
He is absorbed in reading a detective story.
You have a pretty good memory.
They've bet the farm on it.
I walked about a mile.
Would you mind paying this time?
I went to the mall with my friends.
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
I'm not eating this.
I am sorry for what I did.
You should be careful in choosing friends.
You're not allowed to eat those.
That's true, too.
Don't try to do two things at a time.
No matter what game he plays, he always wins.
He is alert to every chance of making money.
You can stay at my place.
I felt comfortable.
Get out of the car.
I have many friends who are native speakers.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
Her derogatory remarks towards her boss caused her to lose her job.
You're too stupid to live.
I've never had a friend like you before.
She gave him something cold to drink.
You must not be afraid of making mistakes when learning a language.
I don't know where exactly.
I dance in my living room all the time.
He risked his life to save her.
Get out of my car.
I have some reading to do.
Tom and Mary wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.
Thank you for watching.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
She is being blackmailed by him.
We've been waiting all morning.
I asked him if he would help me.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Tom looks very anxious.
I want to go there once again.
Is it really all over?
I want to live in a quiet city where the air is clean.
Tom pulled a box from under the bed.
These photos are beautiful.
How can you be sure of that?
Is there any help available?
I don't have any trouble believing that.
I am glad that the matter was settled amicably.
Give your passport number and your date of birth.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
You don't need to wait.
My life was in danger.
I need a laptop.
You didn't need to come.
It's a sunny day.
I guess I'm spoiled.
I have done everything I was supposed to do.
He often falls in love.
Books are for people who wish they were somewhere else.
He didn't give me time to think.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
I suddenly thought of my dead mother.
They did what they were told.
He broke them.
I'm glad you're all right.
He is intelligent.
He has not written to them for a long time.
No one is there.
Don't forget that she's a woman.
Do you love your country?
I heard the telephone ringing.
The streets are clean.
You're annoying me.
Can you promise me you won't tell Tom?
I understand your dilemma.
The higher we go up, the thinner the air becomes.
I was impressed with her work.
It'll help you save energy.
Isn't life just great?
I don't know really.
He ran into the room.
Keep me in the loop.
This diamond is fake.
The storm developed into a typhoon.
At home, we speak only French.
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
He said that he would be eighteen on his next birthday.
She talked him into accepting the bribe.
Tom is unable to cope with stress.
What's the fare to Liverpool?
The accident deprived him of his sight.
His long absences were starting to provoke suspicion.
I didn't know what to say to him.
What's your favorite breakfast food?
She wore a white dress.
I can't do it without somebody's help.
It'll be nice to see everyone again.
I think he is a good man.
If you had a time machine, which year would you visit?
Our teachers are highly qualified.
I don't have time to deal with this letter. Could you deal with it?
I'm not exactly surprised.
What did you turn up?
I would like to go to Austria to study music.
You should apologize to him for coming late.
You can use my car if you drive carefully.
He started swearing.
I feel very relaxed.
He's three years older than I am.
Have you called the boss already?
I had a good opinion of her.
He used a lot of honey.
How will you pay your debts?
I showed my room to him.
She asked him where he lived.
Please pour me a little tea.
She will have her own way.
She got up at seven in the morning.
His hobby is stamp collecting.
It has begun.
Is anyone going to eat that?
I gave up eating dessert.
Do you guys need anything else?
Show me your hands.
How can I get to heaven?
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
They accused me of being a liar.
I want to hear anything you have to say.
Look in the phone book.
Do you want to make a deal?
I feel nothing.
Did you hear all that?
I am going to a concert next week.
Her condition took a turn for the worse last night.
I don't know how to use it.
Thank you very much for your present.
I won't close the door.
Nobody likes rats.
Were you successful?
The structural integrity of the building is compromised.
All I think about is you.
I do not accept your excuse.
I don't dare tell him such a thing.
I'll wait in the car.
Her cleverness often amazes me.
Can you unclog the toilet?
I just want to hear you talk about it.
Tom is really busy most of the time.
Which of you will try it first?
We have an open relationship.
I need you to leave now.
I'd like to see the budget.
The fish smells bad.
I know you're working part-time.
Don't leave your work half finished.
I support you whole-heartedly.
Be quiet, all of you.
How many people live in your town?
I'm proud of my father.
Try on this sweater.
I saw something.
Tom isn't overweight.
He has been to France.
The teachers greeted the children.
Which of you will go?
May I begin?
We'll start whenever you are ready.
Say hello to your sister for me.
I'm not drinking tonight.
That's all I needed.
Go grab a drink.
What is the difference between A and B?
Her husband is a member of the Oda family.
He witnessed the accident on his way to school.
It's been a while since I've seen you.
I'm capable of making my own decisions.
It's getting cold.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
Whatever you do, don't smile.
He showed his photograph album to me.
Are you through with your breakfast?
I'd study harder if I were you.
I think that I should organize a little party.
Don't think about it.
You can go to the station by bus.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
She grew up near the sea, yet she hates swimming.
I haven't made much progress.
Can we get started now?
I'm not at all busy.
Here are our books.
Fish like carp and trout live in fresh water.
He lives in an apartment.
Can someone please open the door?
We're here to protect you.
Our problems are nothing compared to hers.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm sober.
Is this correct?
This is my umbrella.
I get a haircut every month.
We miss you a lot.
She answered my letter right away.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
The doctor's remarks reassured the patient.
Were there any witnesses?
There's an answer to everything.
I made tea.
Fire!
I just don't want you making any mistakes.
It's a tough place to be.
Mary is still as beautiful as she was when she was a teenager.
We make progress only one step at a time.
I want a dozen cream puffs.
What's the catch?
I just want to get married.
Tell me why you're upset.
I went into the army.
She is a difficult person to deal with.
I wasn't invited.
My younger brother is watching TV.
What's kept you?
I have done my homework.
He never gave in to temptation.
Do you think you've made the wrong choice?
They sat under a tree.
I shouldn't have done that.
The question is who will do it.
This is how I did it.
Tom seems so nice.
You shouldn't be in here.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
I want to know who sent you.
Do you want to touch it?
I decorated it.
Do you ever sleep?
That's enough crying. Pull yourself together.
His health gradually changed for the better after he went to live in the countryside.
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
She played a sonata.
People say that he's still alive.
It was night.
I'm almost sure of it.
Tom wants me to stay away from him.
I did as I was told.
Everyone's eating.
I can hear you loud and clear.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
Whose office is this?
I have one child.
Can you imagine what life will be like for them now?
He is a spoiled child.
Can you give us your point of view?
My sister has long legs.
They're brave.
I'll fix your wagon.
I want to spend my life with you.
Will you have a cup of tea?
You can't be sure of that.
I ride a bike to work.
I bet you're feeling really good right now.
Where did you put my umbrella?
Did I give you the tickets?
You speak French, don't you?
He wears designer glasses.
Do you accept Visa card?
Can I sit down?
The family had been sleeping for about two hours when the fire broke out.
Does this ring a bell?
What happened on the bus?
How many times a week do you spend time doing fun stuff with your children?
Why do you hate me?
This plane flies between Osaka and Hakodate.
Why did you come home so late?
What brand of cigarettes do you smoke?
What is your favorite sport?
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Thanks for the invitation, Tom.
I feel bad about that.
I'll go by plane.
Is your father a doctor?
I have rights.
I will not stand for this.
He deals in grain.
Is this what you were looking for?
She promised to meet him last night.
I've been looking all over for you.
It's a plausible diagnosis.
Complete the sentence.
I'm careful.
That's not my call.
I will come by all means.
Work is behind schedule.
You don't have to wait until the end.
I'm not blushing!
I've been kind of busy.
So what do you suggest?
We have to do better.
I could sure use that money.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
He can't read it.
Our army attacked the enemy during the night.
That's very reassuring.
I don't like it when you do that.
Could you please take me back home?
Your question has no answer.
I'm a few minutes late.
She wants to marry a rich man.
How do you eat like that without gaining weight?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Man is the only animal that can speak.
It's for you to decide.
You look younger.
This song reminds me of my junior high school days.
It's not always like that.
I tried.
I knew they were on the list.
Here he is!
You were hurt, weren't you?
He spoke highly of you.
You're doing the right thing.
I felt awful.
She has an advantage over me.
Tom doesn't know that he's adopted.
What you said is complete nonsense.
I'm not breaking the law.
I asked Tom why he wanted to go to Boston.
You're such a liar.
I respect your talent.
Tom went to his study and locked the door.
The athletic meet was postponed due to rain.
I'm sorry, but can't answer right away.
That's how he likes it.
He missed the deadline.
He deals in hardware.
How will I pay my debts now?
Is there a lot left to do?
Did you have a good time at the party?
I can't come over tonight.
She hasn't reimbursed me yet.
How long will this nice weather last?
Tom started climbing.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
The boy was accompanied by his parents.
Next year will be worse.
Have you ever eaten Japanese food?
I was trapped in a vicious circle.
They kissed inside the planetarium.
They received a box of books.
He is getting better bit by bit.
The food in my country is not very different from that of Spain.
Let me ask you a stupid question.
Never forget to lock the door.
There's no danger.
You have betrayed us.
Not every bird can sing.
What if something goes wrong?
Don't worry.
Isn't it true?
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
He is deeply attached to her.
You don't have to come.
Move out of my way.
Let's finish what we started.
Forget I said anything.
The weather is very hot.
I don't work late tomorrow night.
How curious!
I haven't read the book you're talking about.
I've remarried.
It's been a long time since I've worn a tie.
I guess you are right.
Tom shaved off his mustache.
I got up early the next morning to catch the first train.
There is so much pollution in New York that joggers often wear masks when running.
I love this job.
The fire destroyed the tall building.
Have you told anybody?
Please be kind to others.
It is time to go to bed.
Nothing happened to Tom.
That's a lovely necklace.
Why are you interested?
It's your choice.
Why don't you look for a job?
They're drunk.
I didn't want to look foolish.
Tom likes being the center of attention.
I often stay up all night.
We mean business.
Get out of my chair.
She stays in touch with him.
You are twice as strong as me.
A man called on you last night.
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer.
Tom is proud of his son.
He came back from America.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
This is all a big misunderstanding.
I like the Terminator films because the special effects are fantastic.
That's what I'm counting on.
Don't worry about the past.
I don't want to hear any more of your complaining.
I will wait for a week.
She's a glamorous girl.
There wasn't a soul in sight.
He wears expensive clothes and owns a lot of jewelry.
I have fond memories of all the time we spent together.
By the way, where do you live?
Tom says he doesn't know.
When did you get there?
You may go anywhere you like.
Are you going there on business?
I have to think.
He has a drug allergy.
Please help yourself.
Could you please tell me what your cell phone number is?
My sister isn't studying now.
You have to choose your own destiny.
She has a claim on her deceased husband's estate.
I am in trouble.
I think you ought to postpone the meeting.
You're very good.
Come over here and join us.
Some TV programs are interesting, and others are not.
I'd rather stay home if it's all the same to you.
They elected her president.
Her car broke down on the way.
He chuckled.
Show me everything.
Incidentally, this room doesn't have anything like an air conditioner. All it has is a hand-held paper fan.
He doesn't mean to be mean. It's just his nature.
We'll hurry.
He took credit for my idea.
This car is like new.
Are you willing to make a deal?
He was present at the meeting yesterday.
It would never have occurred to me to say anything like that.
Were you going to the train station when I saw you?
I haven't seen you for ages.
Who among us is perfect?
His hobby is collecting old stamps.
I don't think people should make a mountain of a mole hill.
I made a list.
I don't see what we can do.
Tom calls Mary every night.
The coffeepot is boiling.
I don't see anybody else around here.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
What did you want to talk with me about?
He is a man of faith.
He is very fond of music.
In a word, she is guilty.
He devoted the last years of his life to writing his autobiography.
Don't do it!
The water was cold.
I love the fact that you always seem to care so much.
Three more passengers got on the bus.
I do think it's possible.
I hurried and managed to catch the bus.
He tried to open the door.
I realized that even though I wanted to eat, I didn't have enough time.
I like cats.
This is the house he was born in.
That's why no one wants to work with you.
I figured you'd be impressed.
Do you work here?
That job gave him little gratification.
He has taken charge of his father's company.
I know that this is important to you.
I like spring.
How long have you been out of prison?
I've got plans.
Give this book to Ramu.
I still love this bicycle.
Tom likes that one.
How did you think it would go?
We're here now.
I got the ticket for free.
Is this some kind of joke?
Tom looked like he was unhappy.
There is a bag on the desk.
She takes everything for granted.
Today you can get two for the price of one.
That was why he entered the university.
You should acquaint yourself with the local customs.
I hate hospital food.
I know what those books are like.
We need to get going.
Please ask someone else.
Tom wasn't sure.
You're not making this easy.
I wanted your cooperation.
Economic development is important for Africa.
Stay a moment.
They stayed up all night.
We're waiting for you to leave.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Tom didn't get off the airplane with the rest of the passengers.
I really thought I could do it.
Can I help you?
I jog twice a week.
We have the whole summer to play.
I'm speaking.
What have you come here for?
I think we should hire Tom.
Tom is reading in his bedroom.
He asked me if I knew his father.
You're trustworthy.
Wait here.
You have no right to pass judgement on these people.
I had planned to leave for New York the next morning.
Did you have a nice summer?
She is a kind girl.
Everyone smiled.
He gave me some stamps.
He often quotes from Shakespeare.
Who do you know in Boston?
Take a deep breath, please.
Tom was forced to resign.
Let's rent bicycles over there.
We should call the doctor.
I have to open my shop.
You should do it.
It is not the correct solution.
He ran through the streets naked.
Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan.
I've had enough.
Are you involved in politics?
He slept an hour.
Do you take work home with you?
I want a volunteer to help me.
We want to talk with Tom.
I hear someone coming.
Do you know all these people?
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
I want you to help me get out of here.
You need to stop saying no to Tom.
My sister isn't used to cooking.
Be careful not to catch a cold.
He's too old for me.
This word has two meanings.
He knows nothing about politics.
Do I have to attend the party tonight?
Stop being so nice to me.
What are your measurements?
That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?
Don't act like that.
He is swimming in the pool.
I went to the hospital.
I was completely shocked.
We're going upstairs.
That was the hardest thing I ever did in my life.
There was a tape recorder on the table.
You are a student.
I am exhausted.
I care about all of you.
To tell the truth, I didn't notice it.
She is devoted to her husband.
You should have seen him.
Have you taken your medicine yet?
Most castles have a moat surrounding them.
Tom gets on my nerves.
You have not seen him.
I really want to believe you.
Are you interested in foreign languages?
He didn't keep his word.
This should be fun.
I'll be there right away.
I taught myself French.
I almost dropped the plates.
We finally arrived at the lake.
I love lasagna.
This figure is supposed to represent Marilyn Monroe, but I don't think it does her justice.
We're not home.
Iron is used in shipbuilding.
Let's just leave it at that.
I know you don't like me very much.
I have something very important to tell you.
I can explain.
We should do our best.
What results do you anticipate?
I wasn't listening.
I like to talk about the good old days.
Tom whispered something into Mary's ear.
My cat rubbed her head against my shoulder.
We can't live without water for even one day.
How did you get them?
She makes herself up every morning.
Tom is the man of my dreams.
The middle finger is the longest.
If everyone pitches in, we can do it.
I'm really tired.
Blood is thicker than water.
He attained his goal.
You should take my advice.
You like English, don't you?
What time does your plane depart?
He raised his hand.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
What should I be doing?
Is this seat vacant?
I just got a raise.
They're going to give me an estimate.
Tom asked Mary to watch the children.
No one can deny that.
We want more food.
I count on your help.
Humans originated in Africa.
I ran away in a hurry.
No one looks happy.
English is not my first language.
Knock on the door.
I must apologize.
I wish you would take me to a restaurant for a change.
Why are you washing your hands?
I know all about you.
I tried to call you but I couldn't.
I plan to go to the movies.
I'll forgive you.
I don't have your strength.
What did you do last night?
Those who work hard find unexpected opportunities to succeed.
He keeps on asking me for money.
I'd like to hear what your opinion is.
My tailor is rich.
Don't try to talk right now.
I'm going to need your help on this.
What's that building?
Please tell me what you think about this article.
Dinner is almost ready.
How did you know that man was a cop?
She gave it to him.

I want to check out now.
Let me win for once.
I think I like eating white rice better than brown rice.
My boyfriend is not a loser.
Do you mind if I use your computer?
We can seat you soon.
"Will you have another slice of pie?" "Yes, please."
What were you thinking?
You should eat more.
Lend me as much money you can.
We were very busy last week.
I think that's a stupid idea.
Tom said you told him to wait.
Take heed of her advice.
Will you have another slice of pie?
You don't have to come.
Could you pass the salt?
I've been trying to get your attention.
When did you get there?
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
I have nothing to say to you.
You and I are good friends.
Don't use all the hot water.
I've always liked your hair that way.
He needed capital to start a new business.
Don't forget your phone.
She's a determined woman.
This rose is beautiful.
He must love you.
He's on sentry duty.
I can't believe we're talking about this.
I can't give you anything.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I don't want to lose my boyfriend.
She was able to solve the problem in ten minutes.
Your secret will be safe with me.
I want to learn how to speak French.
This is creepy.
I want a divorce.
She was born at six a.m. on July 17.
Don't you agree?
Why are you so tired?
I really need to catch the first train tomorrow morning.
I will advise you on the matter.
I'm calling security.
I turned right.
Tom is too young to go to school.
I'll be direct.
Tom bought Mary some expensive clothes.
Tom has done his homework.
I pretended to be asleep.
She had a basket full of apples.
Is that a crime?
Let me introduce you to a good dentist.
She stammers when she feels nervous.
No one's around.
Where's my box of chocolates?
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
Let's not tell anybody.
We don't have a reservation.
Do not give in to those demands.
Over the holidays, I spent days doing nothing.
Send him in.
A fire broke out nearby.
This is what I've always wanted to do.
All I want is your love.
You don't need millions to be happy.
His car is gaining on us.
The storm stopped the train.
We've already sent a message to Tom.
My father works here.
Where do I turn?
Your hair will grow back.
Will you turn on the television?
Why don't you take off?
After spending three weeks looking for a job, he found a well-paid one.
Tom really likes traveling.
We met last week.
Is it safe?
You can stay with us for the night.
She is devoted to her children.
Do you think Tom saw us?
Tom has enough money.
I never meant to put you in any danger.
What're you saying?
I'm afraid I can't.
Do you have a dog?
She took advantage of my ignorance.
Would you go to your room?
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
I think it's wonderful.
Are you over your cold yet?
Are you on dope?
It is often said that the Japanese are hard workers.
Their friendship moved us deeply.
She gave a vague answer.
I'm really happy.
He missed the deadline.
You can call me at any time you like.
He still hasn't responded.
Come soon.
He's an independent thinker.
If you were to hear him speak French, you would take him for a Frenchman.
You aren't busy now, are you?
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
This is my friend.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
When I was a child, I used to go to the seashore every summer.
This is not good at all.
It's the best-kept secret in town.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Tom was fast asleep.
Suddenly, it looks bigger.
I don't know if that's wise or not.
I'm an innocent man.
The meeting started with some general chit-chat to break the ice.
You can't erase the past.
I wish we'd met earlier.
I have many coins in this box.
It's a cloak-and-dagger operation.
Is this really happening?
What book did you buy?
What has become of your sister?
Please write down your name.
He drinks a lot of milk every day.
Take a bite.
He asked me if I were happy.
She thought for a few minutes.
I want to go with you tonight.
This book isn't as heavy as that one.
His car spun out of control going around the curve.
I need something to eat.
There's no door.
I caught them in the act.
I wanted to see you, too.
I know what I'll do.
It's my problem.
What are you guys drinking?
Keep working.
Follow us. We're headed to the nearest bar.
He became the company president when he was thirty.
We must work hard to break down social barriers.
I saw an old woman cross the street.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
I despise Tom.
It tasted sweet.
His grandfather died of cancer last year.
Why do you want such an old car?
There is no use in making excuses.
Where is your school?
Most young people have a mobile phone.
Tom has done other stupid things.
Do you know something I don't know?
Tom had a little accident.
A little louder, please.
I don't know what I'm doing yet.
He left the water running.
I'm concentrating.
We need both.
I no longer believe anything you say.
Which tooth hurts?
You are late.
He went home yesterday.
Tom mistook me for my older brother.
I totally agree with what you say.
This is the end.
Just call me when you're done.
Did you find your keys?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
It's within walking distance.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
This cake is sweet.
Here's one of my favorites.
He's old and crazy.
Many people use ATMs to withdraw money.
I saw Tom going into the bank.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
I don't think it was a mistake.
I can ride a horse.
Why don't you just ask your parents for money?
I mentioned your name to him.
Don't do it.
The ship was searched thoroughly, but no illegal drugs were found.
I am reading a letter.
Are you still happy?
I can't force you to do anything.
Could you drive more slowly?
Tom left his umbrella in the classroom.
My opinion doesn't really matter.
I'm not going to stop.
Why don't you put some clothes on?
He was surprised by the news.
Tell me where you've been.
They want you dead.
We should help.
Take a few steps and tell me if it hurts when you walk.
You mean you're just giving up?
Let's keep each other company for a while.
You have changed since I saw you last year.
Tom may change.
I don't know why you want me to do that.
Would you like to hear me sing a song?
Don't tell Father about this.
I like that one better.
The box he found was empty.
Bring me some cold water.
I thought you'd never get here.
Did you play baseball yesterday?
As incredible as it may seem, she ordered a knuckle of ham with sauerkraut.
Please go to the bank.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
They're all mine.
In a sense, you are right.
I think I've had a little too much to drink.
The students burned their textbooks.
Tom won't mind.
I should've been honest with you.
Where's the closest bus stop?
Everybody tasted the food.
Would you please tell this gentleman who I am?
His work is not up to standard.
Are you sure we've never met before?
I'm going to stay here for several days.
I looked in my closet for something to wear.
He heard a noise.
I don't remember mailing the letter.
I do not like wearing anybody else's clothes.
I always drink a glass of milk before going to sleep.
The plane increased speed.
This is not very stylish.
It won't be hard.
We should cancel the hike.
I don't know how you can believe such nonsense.
Are you surprised?
What is the purpose of life?
I don't eat as much meat as I used to.
Our team returned home after a huge victory.
He is playing in his room.
Use this as a model.
Mastering a foreign language requires a lot of hard work.
At first, I mistook him for your brother.
Are they satisfied?
This is for your own safety.
Tom isn't afraid to die.
We're losing it.
Be prepared.
I don't read this kind of book much.
Don't be afraid of seeing the doctor.
What do you want to do when you grow up?
I think the box has something in it.
These people hate all foreigners.
Did you write down the number?
It's not that I am unsympathetic, but I am not able to help you.
Price is not an issue.
Tom and Mary don't really have much in common.
Was her story true?
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
The girl has no mother.
I can't conceive how I could have made such a mistake.
First, you must protect yourself.
Accidents are inevitable.
What part of Australia are you from?
Pick out the shirt that you like best.
He is the father of two children.
I remember hearing this tune before.
I'm going to buy a camera for my daughter.
Have you been to Boston?
She sued him.
She's busy with her work.
I really hope you're right.
I can't function without you.
We long for peace.
I can't believe I forgot about this.
I don't care who Tom is talking to.
Tom tried to control his emotions.
That child may have been kidnapped on his way home.
I apologize to all of you.
We can't see Mt. Fuji from here.
Tom nodded.
Close the door.
That's what makes me nervous.
I thought we were friends.
It is a book.
I am on good terms with my brother.
Tonight would be better.
I asked her for a date.
A woman without a man is nothing.
I found the book by accident.
He rested for a while.
Don't leave town.
I don't know which of you is crazier.
Our local TV station does a pretty good job of covering local news.
I was the last one to start in the race, but I soon caught up with the others.
Pray for all of us.
I didn't win, but at least I got a consolation prize.
That's all you get.
What time does your class end?
We have a lot of work to do.
Can you see the difference?
He has no sense of direction.
Three beers and a tequila please.
She used to wash her hair before going to school.
I've been all over Europe.
Soon it will be gone.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
Who's your most interesting friend?
I knew you'd mess things up.
She's wearing a hat.
My father is busy as a bee every day.
May I ask you something?
These aren't my ideas.
The experiment seemed to be going well.
A new oil tanker was launched.
I didn't think anything was suspicious.
Are you suggesting that it's beyond my comprehension?
I'm good at science.
Go away.
That's all I have to know.
You're ambitious.
I think we're safe for a while.
Who would you like to speak with?
Did you get my email yesterday with the instructions?
We'll survive.
The readers cannot ascertain whether the news is true or not.
She is two years older than you.
I have so much work to do that I have to put off my trip.
I have no experience.
Right now, we have blueberries, blackberries, cherries, strawberries, peaches and nectarines.
I know a very good way to get it done.
He is a diplomat at the American Embassy.
We're going to work together.
I'm not proud of it.
They know things these people want to know.
You were terrified, weren't you?
My father is getting better and better.
You aren't busy now, are you?
She took pity on him.
That's absolutely right.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
He can leave tomorrow.
They were naive.
You'd better come in.
Are you happy with that?
She was busy with household work.
When I was a child, I used to go to the seashore every summer.
It's personal.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
You'd better go home.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
His only wish was to see his son one last time.
I like your techno dance moves.
Think about your future.
The phone is out of order.
I leave this afternoon.
Have you ever driven a van?
I don't want you to worry.
Only my mother really understands me.
I'll make you proud of me.
That's what I told him.
We stayed at a cheap hotel.
She wants to read a book.
Alice will tell you that in Wonderland everything is topsy-turvy.
I heard the song sung in French.
Tom is playing the violin now.
My sister is a good typist.
I have to write a letter.
Can you put the children to bed?
I run a small business.
This one is all yours.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
Let's take a 10 minute break.
Come the day after tomorrow.
I can't remember all their names.
I'm listening to you.
I turned on the lamp.
This music is from the 40s.
That is rather unexpected.
Don't interrupt me! Can't you see I am talking?
Who did you go with?
How did you get in?
I had a fantastic time at your party.
He wants you to come home.
We need to get some medical supplies.
Everything has a purpose.
The car is waxed and shining.
Were you one of them?
It's your duty to vote.
You don't have enough experience.
Read what's on the label.
Only God can help you now.
The elevator is out of order today.
I'm not ready to go yet.
I figured you'd be impressed.
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was in the haunted house.
I want to see you after lunch.
I had to get some help.
Do you like white chocolate?
Tom got a lucky break.
He keeps a cat.
Long skirts are out of fashion now.
I was not conscious of a man looking at me.
Do you actually like this?
I just want to help you.
There is no telling what will happen.
Show me how to do it.
Why didn't you tell us that?
Don't come any closer.
You'll understand it right away.
Tom gets angry when he doesn't get his own way.
It's necessary to avoid stress.
She baked her husband an apple pie.
I grew up in the country.
He has gone blind in both eyes.
I want something to drink.
He gives plain, simple explanations.
I was disappointed with your paper.
I'll do it by all means.
They all need attention.
Do you want a ride?
Are you retarded or something?
We have a good heating system.
They released Tom.
I couldn't catch what he said.
I'm a doctor.
You're doing it right.
We think the world of you.
You're the teacher.
Tom asked Mary to go to the supermarket to get some milk.
I didn't want to be presumptuous.
We get on OK.
Women age faster than men.
I caught him in the act.
I don't have any money on me today.
Long ago, people used to travel on foot.
I wanted to share it.
That is how the accident occurred.
They all stopped.
Tom was bullied as a child.
You've got to go even if you don't want to.
Could I have the bill, please?
He consented on the spot.
He took his time.
I know a shortcut.
Stop me if you've heard this one.
I spent all yesterday afternoon cleaning my room.
He loves her.
The orchestra is playing.
I ate a salad for lunch.
He had three sons who became lawyers.
You can't win every time.
Did you see anyone leave?
That's what they all say.
We set up the tent next to the river.
Deal us the cards.
Please bring the others.
It never gets old.
I want that job.
Maybe that's the reason.
Dating is exhausting.
Tom is not dumb.
I play the guitar in my spare time.
He ran through the streets naked.
It was kind of you to help me.
These containers are airtight.
It's taking us way too much time to get this job finished.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
You have to believe in yourself.
Stop being so nice to me.
You ruined everything.
This is my old bike.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
Yours is better.
I'm cultured.
Call home!
She is always complaining about something or other.
I had fun last night.
See things as they are.
He avoids me.
His lackadaisical attitude to studying explains his poor grades.
He will come in a moment.
No one ate anything.
I don't know how to cook.
You're no singer.
Grab this.
Cherry blossoms are very beautiful.
Tom has to do that right away.
Tom hid behind the shower curtain.
The top of Mt. Fuji is covered with snow.
The flame went out.
Please come here between two and three this afternoon.
I said nothing.
That sounds right.
I just got out of prison three months ago.
Is there anything that I can do for you?
I'm having the same problems.
I made dinner.
She looked him right in the eye.
You're a little liar.
They're very smart.
How do you know I didn't do it?
The sand was warm.
That's happened to me plenty of times.
I am no match for him.
A rush-hour traffic jam delayed my arrival by two hours.
Don't make me do this.
You've got to move.
Why are you doing this?
We've lost valuable time.
She kissed my cheek.
They had a lovely time together.
No charges have been filed.
Buy me a drink.
You broke the rule.
Tom will never believe me again.
I have done all that I can.
I want to have a telephone installed.
I see him in the library now and then.
We need to be prepared.
Would you please show me that skirt?
Can you justify the use of violence?
Each country has its own customs.
Make your move.
We're in town.
I have some good news for you.
You go first.
I didn't have the sense to do so.
Why is it that she looks so sad?
I haven't washed my hair.
You attach too much importance to what he says.
Malaria is a disease that mosquitoes carry.
That's not how I see it.
I'm not exactly sure.
Why did Tom kill himself?
Do you want another one of these?
Trying to do such a thing is a waste of time.
She is friendly to everybody.
I met him just now.
You're spending too much time watching TV.
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
He looks like a girl.
He looked at her from head to foot.
Can you give me a sign?
She hired him as an interpreter because she had heard that he was the best.
Charles Moore created Forth in an attempt to increase programmer productivity without sacrificing machine efficiency.
She asked him for some money.
It's a no-brainer.
I like that.
Tom wanted Mary to sing his favorite song.
Don't be upset.
It bothers me a lot.
Don't you think this suits me?
I helped you when you needed help.
I live in this house by myself.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
Better a broken promise than none at all.
I need to take Monday off.
They went on board the ship.
We went to the park to take pictures.
Let's sit where there is some shade.
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker no matter how much I try.
I met an old friend by chance in Kyoto.
He was sick, but he went to school.
France is in western Europe.
I'd like to do this some other time.
They sent me to kill you.
When did America become independent of England?
He presented her with a doll.
I had to rent a car.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
Should we go by car or by taxi?
You're under investigation.
Is it going to rain today?
Please remain seated until the aircraft arrives at the gate.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
He sent me a present.
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.
I will go to the meeting.
What's wrong with this one?
Why are we wasting time like this?
Talking in the library is not allowed.
Tom didn't look that happy.
He's a ghostwriter.
You have given me so many.
"Why don't you come?" "Because I don't want to."
Don't tell anybody.
This tape isn't sticky.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Did I leave my umbrella here?
Tom won three races.
You're doing all you can.
I'd suggest the following change.
He is on board the ship.
I will give him the book tomorrow.
She disappeared.
People came to like her paintings.
Tom is always very aggressive.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
I'll bring you something to eat.
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
Tom will find it.
I never did get it right.
Why did you come here today?
I walked here.
I'm above telling lies.
I can't let them catch me.
Are you coming with us?
He told me that he wanted to leave the company.
Can I speak to you?
I'd like to get started right away.
Please sum up your idea.
That's about all.
I never want to leave you again.
We sometimes lack patience with old people.
Sydney is far from here.
Have you slept?
You weren't married for long, were you?
I cannot feel at home in such a hotel.
We don't need to do this every day.
I brushed my hair.
This table isn't steady.
If your tooth hurts, you should see a dentist.
Did I miss much?
I guess you're right.
You have to stay in shape.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
Tom and Mary became lifelong friends.
Someone broke into my apartment.
This meat is chicken.
Don't mess up my system.
I loved that house.
Isn't anybody going to say congratulations?
Tom walked to the parking lot.
Will you light the fire?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I spend a lot of time listening to music.
I am through with my work.
The Bakers have a farm up the river.
You will exist but you will never know what it is to live.
Wash your hands before meals.
I love my mother very much.
Grab hold of this.
She found it dull living in the country.
We're really drunk.
In the first place, we must be careful about what we eat and drink.
Are you up?
Who's at the switchboard today?
My mother feels better.
I can't believe how beautiful you are.
I didn't think you were needed.
Is it OK if I sit here?
It's a huge responsibility.
You're fortunate.
I want this building locked.
He spoke with a typical Texan drawl.
Tom made a pilgrimage.
Please let me explain.
I can't stand it anymore.
Be more flexible.
They found no such proof.
Many young people were present at the party.
Please lend me the video when you have seen it.
Heavy rains fell for more than a day.
He owes me a favor.
They like apples.
I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
He rushed out of the office.
Tom ate my lunch.
You recognize him, don't you?
I am no longer young, but I can still bite.
I got up early as usual.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
I don't remember anything happening.
I figured you'd understand.
Don't go if you don't want to.
Having finished the work, he went to bed.
This is the same necklace that I lost yesterday.
He has squandered every opportunity I've given him.
Have you ever had lunch at this restaurant?
Finding his office was easy.
I think we both know how Tom feels.
Tom looks thrilled.
You can't get rid of it.
The Japanese government can't cope with the problem.
I love your apartment.
I'm a stranger here myself.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
He has gone out.
One lives in Fukuoka, and the others live in Niigata.
How do you like New York?
He played an important role on the committee.
What did you think I meant?
She was very surprised at the news.
Are you enjoying your weekend?
He treats me as if I were a stranger.
I don't know why it's taking so long.
I hate those kinds of answers.
It's almost time to go.
I'll never tell anyone where I've hidden the treasure.
Do we have enough food?
You're the only person I know who is qualified for this job.
Deal us the cards.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
Forget about her.
How many songs have you written?
You've already given me enough money.
Her son was killed in a traffic accident.
How could you not notice?
A doctor should never let a patient die.
Anyone could do that.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
Tom isn't as tall as I am.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
English is not my mother tongue.
I don't know how to spell the word.
Get out of the truck.
I need sleep.
He can play both tennis and baseball.
My cat loves shrimp.
I know you think there's no hope.
Tom pressed the button and waited.
You don't need to come so early.
Maybe it was just a fluke.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
I don't need that kind of help.
Think it over and tell me what you decide.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
They love their children.
Everyone is angry.
Tom said he didn't know how to swim very well.
They were satisfied with the result.
I'd rather die than surrender.
We'd like you to sing a song.
Neither is true.
We can't get out of this.
What kind of wine should I bring?
This gift is for you.
They're barely paid minimum wage.
He asked me what I expected.
A number of countries have strict laws against drugs.
Where's the train station?
I saw a man yesterday eating from a garbage can.
I have some things in the hotel safe.
I'm looking for a job.
He doesn't like eggs.
Here we are.
The city is gaining popularity as a major tourist destination.
You're not alone anymore.
How are you doing these days?
Don't open the window.
She must have worked very hard.
I decided not to go to Europe.
I'm beginning to understand why Tom loves Boston.
You lucky devil!
We're not interested.
Put your hat on.
He goes there three times a week.
Maybe we can find someplace to park further up the street.
Here's one of my favorites.
I always knew you'd be back.
If the sun were to go out, all living things would die.
I'm going to be out today.
His family works in the fields.
That's a controversial theory.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
The ceremony was held in honor of the guest from China.
I want to do this as much as you do.
Tom isn't afraid of anything.
I looked all over for Tom.
A trip to Mars may become possible in my lifetime.
In the U.S., it is common for people to write a check instead of paying cash.
He changed his job.
Can you still remember where we first met?
Did you think I was Canadian?
She advised him not to eat between meals.
I'm stuck.
He looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
I do not fear death.
I want to recover my valuables.
I knew who he was.
He plays baseball every day.
They make a great team.
Are you relaxed?
I have information.
Roger Miller was born on January 2, 1936 in the western city of Fort Worth, Texas.
The birds were flying in a group.
They love coffee.
Maybe Tom would like that.
I don't mind even if she doesn't come.
She warned him not to go out at night alone.
When he got into trouble, he turned to his parents for help.
What did they hit you with?
We don't like rain.
There are seven days in a week.
That's quite enough.
You're not my mother.
That blue dress suits you very well.
The monkey got away.
I can't stop you from revealing my secrets. However, I beg you not to.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
Stay away from that place.
There is an apple on the desk.
Hand in your papers.
He made up the whole story.
The statue has no head.
You should see a doctor.
Bulgarian is like Russian.
The dog was dying.
She can't swim.
I really liked that.
I was careless.

I had a mental breakdown.
Please speak as clearly as you can.
I am truly sorry.
As for me, I am satisfied.
It was quite dark when I got home.
I just had something incredibly strange happen to me.
I have nothing more to say about him.
Tom doesn't seem busy.
The meeting room is occupied at the moment.
The reason for this is obvious.
He tried to get me to help him.
There's no one to look after her.
I read all kinds of books.
I've already fed the baby.
I have hardly any money left.
I understood what you meant.
She hit me, not him.
Tom kissed his cousin.
They drank way too much.
Can you get the door to shut?
Can you go to the office by train?
Stop playing hard to get.
Tom often mispronounces people's names.
We should have left earlier.
He denied having written to me.
Recently we have had several disasters.
We want you to sing the song.
Be quiet, girls.
I'm just not sure.
I like that skirt.
You're the only person I know who can't swim.
Is your name on the list?
I only have ten books.
You are too young to travel alone.
I fell asleep while I was doing my homework.
You are big.
It's almost seven. We have to go to school.
That was a great party.
Were you there?
Which dog is yours?
The radio doesn't work.
She gave me a large room while I stayed at her house.
I never wanted this, either.
While you are asleep, the bodily functions slow down and body temperature falls.
It's missing.
Tom finally mustered up the courage to ask Mary to go out with him.
I have to leave school.
People are saying that the crisis is over.
I have two daughters and two sons.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
The organ started to play.
The meeting took place yesterday.
There's no use crying over spilt milk.
This bag cost me 6 pounds.
I know what Tom and Mary are going through.
You were hurt, weren't you?
Did you have your photograph taken for the driver's license?
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
I have enough money to buy it.
These cookies are star-shaped.
I have to wear boots.
My daughter is in her late teens.
I will call you in an hour.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
How is your last name written?
Can you help me on this one?
Why don't you take over?
The general inspected the troops.
Don't tell anybody.
I've made my decision.
Don't speak in Japanese.
I wasn't aware that you were feeling so bad.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
There's no need for an apology.
There's something I have to ask you.
I take a bath once a day.
I can hardly imagine him going abroad.
I ran into your mother in the library.
What's all the hurry?
You need to fix this.
You don't look that good.
I only did the bare minimum.
That's not all that happened.
Let me do my job.
He is sadly mistaken.
I outwitted him.
I think Tom is a really nice kid.
Can I tell you something about women?
I just wanted to thank everyone.
I have high blood pressure.
What is it you really want to tell me?
I know what they mean.
You didn't have to lie.
Stop talking.
Wait a sec.
Stay away from my woman.
What exactly don't you get?
There are only two days left.
The planet nearest to the sun is Mercury.
You don't seem so busy.
I really appreciate all your help.
Let's sit on the bench.
All the girls love Tom.
I don't need to be here right now.
Tom is the one who doesn't understand.
I'm in bed.
We went back to the living room.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
I've got to skedaddle or I'll be late.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
Can you deliver this?
I have to deal with this alone.
The girl I told you about lives in Kyoto.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
I don't have the money to buy that book.
He was not pleased.
All my friends are invited here.
You're embarrassing me.
I enjoyed myself.
How do you spend your time?
Don't talk to your father like that.
Tom is an aspiring writer.
In the summer, the temperature ranges from thirty to forty degrees Celsius.
We wanted you.
All we need is a little patience.
You've told me that joke before.
Would you like to come?
I missed a step on the stairs and I'm afraid I sprained my ankle.
The two runners reached the finish line at the same time.
A boy snatched my purse as he rode by on his bicycle.
You're very brave.
Her father is a bank clerk.
Not everybody was as lucky as we were.
Do you want to go fishing tomorrow?
Tom and Mary are the same height.
This is today's newspaper.
Do you know the difference?
Darkness causes many children to be afraid.
Can I borrow your car?
If you eat too much, you'll become fat.
It's a rental.
I really would rather be alone right now.
His blood is boiling.
I wasn't involved.
I don't handle loneliness well.
How did you enjoy the movie?
You don't need to study today.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
I'm surprised to see you.
I thought you'd want to see this.
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other.
Isn't that annoying?
I promised I wasn't going to do this.
I don't care.
I need that.
He is always making a fool of me.
He did all the legwork.
I can't sleep when I'm stressed out.
I got fined.
She kept crying all night.
They're mad at you.
They grew closer.
I had a dreadful dream last night.
I'm looking for a house.
People who go to bed early and get up early live a long time.
Please wait half an hour.
Tom lay awake for a long time wondering about what he should do.
I told you not to do that.
Tom explained why he was there.
You're either with me or you're against me.
Winds from the sea are humid.
What are you cooking?
He did not say a word to us.
Our lives are in your hands.
I'd like to visit London.
Nobody suspected anything.
Just tell me this isn't going to get me into trouble.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
I think you know why I'm here.
I don't like to inhale someone's smoke while I'm working.
You shouldn't trust Tom.
Life is enjoyable.
She always fed her children before she fed her dog.
She has been unhappy since her cat died.
It looks fascinating.
I want to sing a song.
She is contemplating a trip.
She gets hives when she eats eggs.
At first, I thought he was your brother.
Do you like the new school better?
Did you see what Tom just did?
We noticed the man enter her room.
He was invited.
Do you like me, too?
I remember all that.
They are not tired.
This is not enough.
She has seen better days.
All of them remained silent.
Come on, talk to me.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
Can you please translate this for me?
I can't tell you the truth.
I suggest that you try to get some sleep.
I thought I told you to trim your beard.
I was good.
I scarcely slept a wink.
Can I get you something to wet your whistle?
My watch is accurate.
A man with a watch knows what time it is, a man with two watches is never sure.
I was foolish enough to believe it.
Don't forget to tip the porter for carrying your luggage.
They were unimpressed.
You're not that old.
Tom is already sleeping.
What books have you read in English?
Why did they hire you?
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
Ask her her name.
I've got a meeting at 2:30.
Don't tell anyone.
I don't care about fashion.
Tom doesn't want to take a walk now.
The decision hasn't yet been made.
If I screw up, what's the worst that can happen?
Tom told me you were in Boston.
How could you do that?
Tom lost a contact lens.
The holidays are coming.
These peaches aren't very sweet.
Give me a beer.
You can't reason with Tom.
We're not late.
We were waiting for him for a long time.
They admired the lovely scenery.
This word comes from Latin.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
Some people say Japan is a male-dominated society.
You should take a vacation.
We all quit.
You're a liar.
I want to stay in America for a few years.
I'm familiar with the situation.
I want to buy a dozen eggs.
It's an inside joke.
I can't bear it.
I am the leader of this team.
He has coached us for half a year.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
They escaped.
Let's dance, shall we?
If you eat that you will die.
The mountain is green.
He can't explain what happened.
He is standing on the hill.
It took exactly an hour.
Stop by whenever you can.
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind yet.
I don't hold that against you.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
How did you come by this painting?
Strange rumors are going around.
I wish that I could give you something.
You could have been happy.
Patience is sometimes the most effective weapon.
Thank you for your time.
He had his sister help him paint the wall of his room.
We were obliged to give up our plan.
Do you think I'm healthy?
My sister plays piano every day.
I told him not to throw stones.
A green banana is not ripe enough to eat.
Was his story true?
We have to go.
My right hand is numb.
Clean up that mess.
Stop making a fool of yourself. Everyone is laughing at you.
They talked about culture.
I've been looking for someone to babysit my children.
Can you believe it? He's even lazier than me.
Who cares?
Whose glasses are these?
I wasn't home.
A few people mentioned they would like to attend some sessions later in the day on the Technical Session Agenda.
I figured I'd find you here.
Do you prefer tea or coffee?
I just don't want to do that right now.
He barely speaks English.
I'm swamped with work.
I'll do what must be done.
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.
He denounced all forms of dishonesty in government.
Can you believe it? He's even lazier than me.
He has his own room.
You never tell me anything.
Tom is able to drive a car.
He became a famous singer.
The people he is living with in London are coming to see me.
How about tonight?
I go to the barber's once a month.
She has a bath every morning.
My foot really hurts.
Let's forget the past and talk about the future.
I'll be able to see you next year.
Let's all go.
I heard you received an award last month.
Are you still afraid?
I'm wearing my swimsuit under my clothes.
The architect achieved worldwide fame.
You were hungry, weren't you?
I thought you were serious.
I exhausted myself by walking a long distance.
I know I got it right this time.
Are you happy in your house?
You touched my heart.
I don't know if I should tell you.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
That can happen.
It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
I love your place.
A man with a big dog came in.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you and your boyfriend had broken up?
Give me one good reason.
I can't live without my cat.
I don't have to talk to you.
I hope you're well paid.
We went to the beach together.
She heard him scream, so she ran into his bedroom.
I thought you'd gone home.
You need to lower your standards.
I will not be able to open the box without breaking it.
By the way, how old are you?
I found it difficult to understand what he was saying.
It's a big country.
I live in the country.
I forgave you a long time ago.
I don't have anybody who'll listen to me.
I really don't have anything else to say.
Get back here.
Do you really hide your money under the mattress?
You've suffered enough.
I am just dying for a Coke right now.
He can't go without wine for even a day.
I want to help, but I can't.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
I don't want to eat here.
This is a book about England.
His wife's a friend of mine.
That makes perfect sense to me.
The baby stopped crying.
You should have told me a long time ago.
No one could tell where she was.
He took the coat off because it was warm.
Tom felt invincible.
They hate each other from the bottoms of their hearts.
I now view life differently than I used to.
I won't come.
I postponed the event.
I'll find my own way back.
I think that I'm not academically oriented.
We both are friends.
It is difficult for me to skate.
This book is geared towards beginners.
I don't often get invited to parties.
You have to turn in the reports on Monday.
There was a lot of wind.
I feel uneasy in my father's presence.
He was seen crossing the road.
Tom walks quickly.
They were angry about several things.
No one misses you.
I come from America.
The boss just chewed him out again.
You're unethical.
He can read and write.
He has a head on his shoulders.
I'm in a good mood today.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
Let's try and find a cure.
Tom and Mary left the party together.
By the way, are you free tonight?
I want you to do something about it right away.
Why did you call?
You nearly died.
See you there.
A stranger spoke to me on the bus.
What grade did you get on the test?
I do not drink coffee.
I feel flattered.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
You're not welcome here.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
Do you like French opera?
Stop complaining about the weather.
Do you like my new clothes?
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
Rabies is the deadliest disease on earth.
Who wants it?
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
You're grown up now.
Don't say anything unless it's important.
That's a very good point.
You said you didn't understand.
I don't want to miss the bus.
The meeting was all but over.
Do you mind if I smoke here?
Do you like trips?
You're welcome.
She was sick in bed yesterday.
That bridge is made of stone.
I lit the candle.
What do you say to a game of chess?
We waited.
I lay on my bed.
My mother was sick for two days.
Get in the van.
Have you ever been abroad?
I took a bus so I wouldn't be late for my appointment.
They got a warm reception.
The road which leads to the hotel is narrow.
Are we friends?
I don't want to hear your theories.
Is there a problem?
I said it was OK for him to go.
What if Tom doesn't like me?
He said he did not know the man, which was a lie.
My brother is at his desk.
Did you see the sunset earlier? It was really beautiful.
I've taken care of everything.
That story can't be true.
The box is too heavy to carry.
We all did well.
You are really very productive today.
Let me find out.
Don't die.
He sat next to her.
You should kick that bad habit.
They have plenty of money.
It's regrettable.
Thanks for stopping by.
I want to keep on living with him.
They both want to say something.
We're all retired.
That's a risk you have to take.
I don't watch TV.
Tom wants to get a tattoo on his chest.
We have lost sight of him.
What on earth is it?
It was a perfect moment.
Tom has willingly done everything we've asked him to do.
I don't know how to say goodbye in French.
How could you not tell me about this?
You recognize her, don't you?
I'm new here.
I am trying to learn English.
I'll leave it up to you.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Do you feel lucky?
What a shame to just endure life rather than enjoying it.
They're broke.
He fixed the broken table.
My children rarely go outside.
Won't you have some tea?
Gasoline is used for fuel.
The cops threw tear-gas bombs into the building.
I speak a few languages.
You've got to take care of yourself.
I didn't want you to get involved.
Is this fake?
It sounds like someone is crying.
I would like to become a top model and travel all over the world.
That narrows it down.
Don't make me ask you again.
I'll drive.
Some people think that it is difficult for a native speaker of English to learn Chinese, but I disagree.
I'd like you to postpone your trip.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.
Are you sure you saw someone on the bridge?
I love you with all my heart.
I'm sorry, but I don't have any small change.
Who's been eating my peanuts?
Who's your boyfriend?
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
He narrowly escaped being run over.
I have no regrets for what I have done.
The prosecutor asked me a leading question.
They sat in a circle.
Throw another log on the fire, will you?
He gave me a big hug.
I'd like to speak with Tom in private.
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
Have you lost your ticket?
I didn't get even one letter from her.
Sawako wants to go to France.
What do you spend most of your time doing?
She knows her limitations.
Is it really possible to do a brain transplant?
You didn't have any choice.
We will fix this.
I want to have a job that I love.
I'm going to take care of it for you.
My sister washes her shoes every Sunday.
You should be careful what you say.
I think it's time for me to organize a party.
He has come out of his shell.
He walked quietly.
I persuaded the policeman not to shoot the monkey.
I know I got it right this time.
I had a headache.
They are from the United States.
That's what I thought you said.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
They walked down the street singing a song.
Do whatever it takes to get the job done.
The sun will set soon.
You can't do this to us.
It's like one of those.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
Be polite to everyone.
What's all that about?
We're going to be aggressive.
My grandmother on my father's side has turned one hundred.
I thought I saw something.
They can't hear me either.
We'll have to shovel the snow off the roof.
She is working night and day.
I'm not going to go to Boston next week.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
We lost our electricity because of the storm.
He is a lovable person.
I was naive.
For the first time in more than 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6%.
Was there anyone else around?
We can't do this without you.
I want those reports on my desk within the hour.
We're not home right now.
You have to give up sports for a while.
He went to Paris two years ago.
Let me write it down so I don't forget.
I always walk.
I said no.
In autumn, leaves change color and fall.
You don't need my help.
Are we all here?
I just hope nothing goes wrong this time.
He studied to be a doctor.
The curtains were all open.
I missed the school bus!
This house is very good.
Is there still any sugar?
This is a big project.
It's sometimes difficult to control our feelings.
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
Please put on your safety glasses.
We'll always have to be careful not to let this happen again.
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I won't go with you unless you tell me where we're going.
Why limit yourself to just one?
He decided to give it a try.
Let's get a picture of us together.
A monument has been erected to the memory of the deceased.
Concert tickets are on sale at this office.
Tom now faces criminal charges.
I had difficulty convincing her of the dangers of smoking.
He bowed to his teacher.
That no longer matters.
I feel sleepy when I listen to soft music.
Take the road on the right.
Can anyone verify that?
The servant swept the floor.
Why do you want to dress like that?
I'm teasing.
Frogs turn into princes only in fairy tales.
I'm not unhappy.
He preferred working to doing nothing.
I just need a little more time.
Words failed her.
He took a day off.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
The article was written in Russian.
He asked me if I were happy.
How did you come by all this money?
Let me know if you can make it tomorrow.
I know someone who can help you.
That's so weird.
I suggest that we go out on Friday.
What a fool I was!
I hardly ever remember dreams.
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
Have you ever been on TV?
I have nothing to do with it.
He went home three hours later.
Is there any adverse reaction?
Would you say that again?
I am more beautiful than you.
She is wiser than I am.
Tom certainly gets a nice sound out of that old bassoon.
He still has not written the letter.
My fingers are so numb with cold that I can't play the piano.
Be discreet.
Teenage boys love playing video games.
Sitting down all day is bad for you.
I just want you out of my house.
After that, he went home.
It doesn't ring a bell.
Tom wanted to learn to swim.
The Prime Minister's speech was calculated to anger the opposition parties.
We discussed the problem at length.
I acted on his advice.
I often make mistakes.
I just want you to know I'm sorry.
Last night, I listened to radio.
I have no intention of changing.
He got up quickly, splashed cold water on his face, brushed his teeth, and shaved.
Is this your bicycle?
I keep saying that I'm innocent, but no one will listen.
I think we'd better help Tom.
They have gone to Europe.
It's not stupid.
I wanted to wish you well.
They live in a rented house.
That hotel is very near the lake.
Tom just died.
He will always be with you.
I never said that.
Don't let that bother you.
This won't take long.
I don't think it's important.
I turned right.
67% of those who never smoked said they worried about the health effects of passive smoking.
Do your very best.
Tom is even scared of Mary.
Who painted this painting?
Unfortunately, I have to get up early every morning.
What were you doing at that time?
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
I like these chairs.
Who invented the telephone?
That's what they all say.
You don't like chocolate, do you?
I know that he went to London.
It is time I left here.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
In Massachusetts, a man is not allowed to marry his wife's grandmother.
I deserve better than this.
Needless to say, he is right.
I know it's not possible.
What floats your boat?
He doesn't love me.
She sang a Japanese song for us.
Our train had already pulled out when we arrived at the station.
What year were you born?
I feel blue.
She said nothing that would make him angry.
I slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk.
May I say something?
You'll be late for work.
I am sure of his success.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Get the door, will you?
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
I'll recommend it.
They worked through the night.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
Tom doesn't work as much as he used to.
Children often cry just to attract attention.
I am not studying now.
The fog is getting thicker.
"How much is he asking for?" "A thousand euros."
The army is in the north to protect the border.
I know you're smarter than that.
Watch the road.
Aren't you too young to smoke?
I shower every day.
I just keep finding excuses.
I should have been watching more carefully.
I heard a dog barking in the distance.
Do you have to stay?
Tom asked Mary if she knew John's wife.
We took shelter under a tree.
Don't despair.
Cattle feed on grass.
He wasn't watching TV then.
He runs a supermarket in the town.
After taking a bath, Tom ate dinner.
A bat hunts food and eats at night, but sleeps during the day.
She's really smart, isn't she?
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
I helped my mother with the cooking.
I just wanted to say thank you.
Night is when most people sleep.
We all had a great time.
I'm scheduled to have lunch with him.
We can't just sit around and do nothing.
That's what I thought you said.
He refused my friend request.
I wish I could help you more.
They all look the same.
Are you finished reading the newspaper?
He comes to see my son now and then.
You should go see a dentist.
I have to comb my hair.
We can't escape.
I'll watch television.
She waited for you for two hours.
Watch my back.
I had a vision.
He's back from his travels in Central Asia.
Let me get that for you.
He can't walk any more.
How many people do you know well?
The button battery for my computer's timer died.
We're all going to die anyway.
Look at the girls.
Everyone did it.
Tom went to Mary's house.
What does what happened last night have to do with what's happening today?
How do I get a hold of you?
Tom showed Mary the ropes.
I asked my boss for a pay raise.
Are you the mayor?
Can I think about it?
I'd like to apply for a visa.
The boy is full of promise.
Tom never got caught.
I think we can help each other.
Have you finished reading the novel?
I think Tom is compassionate.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Why did Tom quit his job?
You've done a pretty good job so far.
Tom sat down on the couch.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
The crankshaft is broken.
I did it for you.
The dog bared its fangs and growled as I approached the gate.
What would you like to eat?
You must have been surprised to find me alone with her last night.
We lead a very ordinary life.
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
How did you get here so fast?
I'll pray hard.
Tom isn't really sick. He's just pretending to be.
All of a sudden, Tom and I were alone.
Thousands of foreigners visit Japan every year.
She told him that her father had died.
Tom is slowly catching up with the rest of the class.
I just wanted to express my condolences.
To reduce misunderstandings we should learn the techniques for communicating successfully.
How did you get so good at French?
Don't make the same mistake twice.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
They're all in there.
You must help your mother.
No one understands you.
Will you tell me?
The stock market crash forced many retirees back into the job market.
He drank a bottle of wine.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
He got tired of reading.
Did I win something?
Has he given up cigarettes?
I got my hair cut yesterday.
I didn't mean it.
Just a few days ago, we were so happy.
I just figured out who you are.
I have to do this alone.
Who made this cake?
I finally have everything I need.
No one can predict where lightning will strike.
She has many handkerchiefs.
You look contented.
How's work?
I think we're about ready.
I don't care for flowers very much.
I'm here to see the manager.
We used to sit on these steps and talk.
Why did you buy a flower?
Everyone was happy.
It was not my intention.
Tom took off his belt.
I never wanted that.
Tom put all his belongings in a small suitcase.
What else have you got going on?
I think you're ready.
You're the one who trained me.
Do you believe Tom is innocent?
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
I'm just trying to get by.
I don't know whether he'll come by train or by car.
Every student in the class knows the fact.
I think perhaps I can help Tom.
I think I should probably go home and get some sleep.
He likes jazz, and so do I.
I suppose you think I'm rich.
These apples are big.
Join us.
I suggest we change clothes first.
We've solved the problem.
This is devastating.
We are expecting the publication of his book.
How did you get interested in art?
She ignored him almost all day.
Tom was trying to control his own violent temper.
He didn't say anything new.
I don't understand what this means at all.

It was a very slow train. It stopped at every little station.
You don't know anything.
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
Stop flirting with my sister.
Whatever you do, don't drop your new phone.
That's all for now, folks.
I would be willing to help you.
How long are you going to keep giving me the silent treatment?
I trusted my teacher.
He's so cute.
Tom knew something wasn't right.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
The results were spectacular.
Tom beat Mary in tennis.
I know this.
He came all the way to talk over a problem with me.

I could've cried.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
I wanted you to have this.
She is the one who took care of his wound.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
Our apartment is on the third floor.

I've seen them all.
I will act on your advice.
All the guys teased me about it.
Drinking and driving can be dangerous.
It could be fun.
I let you catch me.
He did the best he could.
It's not the answer.
You said you needed someone to protect you.
I have no one to leave my money to.
He should have bought some pencils.
Tom can't do the job.
Where did I put that box?
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I have two questions for you.
I'd rather not eat this.
There's a scratch here. Could you give me a discount?
I don't know what I'm doing here.
The phone rang while I was taking a shower.
We've looked at a lot of things.
The cat is under the table.
Did you say something?
We subscribe to a newspaper.
His rude behavior makes me angry.
There have been a lot of complaints about the way Tom behaves.
What's all this stuff?
I don't believe he is a lawyer.
They're looking for Tom.
I can't compete with this.
You don't understand the procedure.

Does she have a hobby?
I thought you were against this proposal.
I want to make a complaint to the management.
Who's to say it's not what's supposed to happen?
How long can you hold your breath?
Tom trusts you.
Who are you supposed to be?
You seem to be in such a nasty mood today.
When did he go?
Tom went to sleep three hours ago.
You're single.
It's a beautiful day.
Stop acting like a child.
I'm going to work during the spring vacation.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Ten years is a long time to wait.
Do you want something to read?
Tom saw Mary walking up the steps.
I left my dictionary downstairs.
I have lots of money.
Are you happy?
Get in the van.
I'll be with you in a second.
Marry me.
Let's get out of here before the cops get here.
My father has gone to America.
Tom wanted to call Mary.
The problem resolved itself.
Let me pay my share.
Is anybody here?
Follow his example.
He was tired, but he kept working.
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.
It is getting warmer day by day.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee and topped off his own.
He is too busy dreaming dreams to plan what he will do in his old age.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
Canada is larger than Japan.
He parties too much.
They're looking for you.
I wonder which way is the shortest.
Do you have anything to eat?
I can't place him.
We are teachers.
I can't decide what to eat for lunch.
I can't go out because I have a lot of homework.
Is that all you've got to say?
She cooked the dinner herself.
You don't have to talk.
Honesty is very important.
Be punctual.
You don't look that good.
Now fix that.
Is there a timetable?
You have a little fever today, don't you?
I know a guy who has never seen snow.
Don't hold it upside down.
I called him, but a girl answered the phone.
You should not be afraid of the future.
As long as we love each other, we'll be all right.
I don't know if that means anything.
When I run, I get sweaty.
Tom put a hand on Mary's right shoulder.
You can get it at a bookstore.
How long have you been in Japan?
The greatest happiness lies in freedom.
I really like that guy.
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.
You can't be too careful these days.
He shaves four times a week.
Tom made me get out of bed.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
Do you want wine?
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
This rule applies to you, too.
We know very little about the cause of this disease.
She told me where to go.
I don't know what I want to do yet.
I just kept my mouth shut.
I lost sight of my friends.
Did you see anybody there?
Don't tell me to go home.
Do you play any sports?
He is sitting on the chair.
I made a list.
How many beers have you had?
I know who did it.
"When do you watch TV?" "I watch TV after dinner."
What makes you think that'll work?
This song is familiar to us.
We're twins.
I feel safe.
Shut off the water.
Is this enough money?
You can't trust what she says.
I had fun.
Finding a solution that worked was a process of trial and error.
She ignored him all day.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
Can't you just accept that?
I'm not alarmed.
You can stay if you like.
I'm supposed to be the one helping you.
Turn off the radio, please.
Take one of these.
Are you still upset about what happened?
He looked well.
You're safe.
We prepared snacks beforehand.
I like your attitude.
What do you like about her?
He doesn't have the necessary skills for that job.
The plane increased speed.
He missed class.
What do you want to talk to me about?
What do you want to eat this weekend?
I deserve this.
Give him my best regards.
Nobody appreciates me.
I like your hair that way.
In politics there are no friends, only partners.
I hope to see you again.
Tom told me not to lock the door.
She's my sister.
Tom is both a doctor and a writer.
That book is worth reading.
I don't have a curfew.
This is exactly what I want.
I caught Tom cheating.
Please fix it.
I must get my watch repaired.
What time did you close the store last night?
I didn't see anyone else.
She is fresh from college, so she has no experience.
I am not rich, nor do I wish to be.
You're very clever.
Be proud of yourself.
We see what we want to see.
There is a hole in his sock.
I'm not marrying you.
I'm wide awake.
I'm not telling you anything.
I will explain it to her.
Are you dressed?
He died at the age of seventy.
I have no intention of meddling in your affairs.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
We don't want them to decrease our paycheck.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
That's all I've got to say.
The world is full of dumb people.
I can't keep this.
Can you read that?
They're part-time employees.
Tom made a list of things he needed to buy.
Just tell us the truth.
It's a stupid idea.
You can still change your mind.
I never want to talk to you again.
I'm only going to say this once, so you better listen.
Who broke this window?
Do you have any plans later on?
Not knowing what to say, I remained silent.
Check, please.
I have always considered you a close friend.
She is a charming woman.
He is playing music.
I often spend my free time listening to music.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
I lost my key.
Everybody was startled.
I suppose you are right.
I want my money back now.
This building has five elevators.
Is anybody there?
My hometown is very pretty.
They huddled together.
What hotel will you be staying at?
I am very happy with it.
I'm not panicking.
Turn left at the first light.
OK, I'm convinced.
You have to get rid of it.
Prince William is second in line to the English throne.
When will you start?
I'm still working on it.
Imagine if you started hiccoughing and you couldn't stop.
When I was your age, I was already married.
You're the only person I can trust.
She's the breadwinner in this family.
There were many things that we wanted to do, but we never got around to doing many of them.
She is old enough to travel by herself.
I like red wine better than white.
It's important that you hear this.
My foot hurts.
Please open your bag.
The mayor provided me with an identity card.
I have children.
I use it.
Did I say I was finished?
What did you want to see me about?
I excused myself for a minute.
And everyone has the ability to contribute.
They have the same habits.
How much will it cost me?
I'd like something to eat.
That kind of thing can happen when you're in a hurry.
I like what you did with your hair.
I care about you a great deal.
How far do we have to go?
Everyone's someplace else.
You'll make the same mistake if things continue in this way.
She cooked vegetable soup last night.
She made him cry.
You took advantage of me.
I just couldn't do it anymore.
It was very funny.
Don't you feel guilty?
I'll take what I can get.
He ignored his father's advice.
He who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing.
I love my home.
I get depressed by the slightest things.
I just wish we could leave this horrible place.
You abandoned me.
I know you feel bad.
I thought Tom died last year in Boston.
People who wait on you here are very friendly.
I told Tom I was going to handle it.
I confessed.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
Why do you want to study abroad?
Do you want us to go with you?
Have you finished it?
No one thinks so.
I've decided to study kanji.
I don't feel like exercising.
We survived!
Please send me a picture of yourself.
This semester I failed two students for plagiarism.
I almost bought that same tie.
It's dark.
I'm aware of the possibility.
He died fighting in the Vietnam War.
Do you like oysters?
Who can blame you?
I really appreciate this.
How long were you there?
I'm ambitious.
Christmas is soon, isn't it?
Can you get a day off?
We arrived at the museum after a ten-minute walk.
What could go wrong?
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
I just want to make it up to you.
My brother is good at mathematics.
He invested his money in stocks.
I am curious.
The heavy snowfall prevented our train from leaving on time.
We will do our best.
Anyone can write his own name.
Where can you get the best fresh bread?
Can you briefly sum up what was said at the meeting?
I can't remember how to spell her name.
I think they're happy.
You're the only friend I have.
Can I use your car for a little while?
Our math teacher drew a circle on the blackboard.
Please keep in touch.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Take this.
Who are you and where do you come from?
You're all alone.
I didn't think you would win the race.
Keep mum about this plan.
Please tell me the answer to the question.
Did you see a doctor?
Tie your shoe.
Tom and Mary both shook their heads no.
My sister is in her twenties.
I figured you weren't coming.
All of us live in the same dorm.
I did that earlier today.
I need a job.
He raised a question.
I'm pressing charges.
I had no idea you could speak French so well.
How fast can you do it?
I've heard this story scores of times.
You should have telephoned in advance.
I had an idea.
What would cause that?
Is death the only way out?
I saw a bum at the train station.
Draw me a seven-pointed star.
She despises him only because he is poor.
Who wants a piece of cake?
He isn't here now.
I know you want to help him.
Don't stay up all night.
What have you heard?
I am more beautiful than you.
The Amazon is fed by a large number of tributaries.
You shouldn't go around telling lies about people.
I would like to have a look at your collection of stamps.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I have been looking for you.
These are questions that matter.
I bought you a gift.
Never tell anyone.
I didn't think you'd come back.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
You have no idea how tired I am of all this complaining.
I hope I'll see you again.
I remember seeing her.
We met at summer camp.
Where are Tom's keys?
Can you drive a five speed?
I have to finish up some things before I go.
Tom doesn't know where to go.
My wife is a good manager.
I'm impressed with your French.
He turned the corner.
I can't identify it.
That's a fact.
I walk in the forest every day.
When do they need me?
I was still eating when the doorbell rang.
I think you should get it.
He made sure nobody could see her.
You are very brave.
A dachshund is a dog from Germany with a very long body and short legs.
He will also go.
She's good at handling children.
Do you read me?
If you're tired, rest.
What she said made him angry.
I spilled my coffee on the carpet.
I don't see the difference.
Something is not right.
We are faced with a host of problems.
She acted as if she knew nothing about it.
He was the first man I interviewed for the job.
Can we just go home?
Ladies first.
This will be a game changer.
I've got a toothache.
I don't want anything happening to you.
I believe the answer is yes.
We're the same.
It's not enough.
We're in love.
She came home after dark.
Why don't you answer your dad?
She used to live in luxury.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
He's afraid to dance.
There isn't any milk in the glass.
She took me by the hand.
He asked his wife if she was coming with him.
I've never been in trouble with the law.
I may not have time.
The old man tripped over his own feet.
He banged his head against a shelf and got a big lump.
He was paralyzed by fear.
It's a direct flight from Tokyo to London.
He has a common name.
This seems risky.
There were a lot of people at the concert.
What do bees eat?
Don't laugh at me.
That's what you should say.
Do not talk with your mouth full.
Tom has passed away.
Did I give you enough time?
She is certain to come on time.
You can stay here as long as you don't make any noise.
He never saw his father again.
They know what happened.
You're crazy to buy such an expensive bike.
The medicine had no effect.
What he says is total nonsense.
I am not a doctor, but a teacher.
They are exhausted.
You can't give Tom that.
I'm hung over.
I used to be like you.
Guys, it's my time to go away.
It's snowing.
My boyfriend is not a loser.
Let's compare the translation with the original.
This is a very tall tree.
If you were my wife, I'd hang myself.
That should only take me a few minutes.
Don't try to talk right now.
Who is that boy running toward us?
She sat at the bar downing shot after shot of whisky.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
That happened to my friend.
We're not going to do it.
I have a business meeting.
I can't wait for him any longer.
She may be a nurse. I am not sure.
Is that your real name?
Thousands of people were deceived by the advertisement.
You're very sophisticated.
No one could find the cave.
The old man looks sad.
He kept on gambling, trying in vain to recoup his losses.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Are you listening to me at all?
Nobody would listen to me.
You know what they can do, don't you?
I had to stop.
The plane left after a three-hour delay.
The boy opened the window, although his mother told him not to.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
I learned French in Paris.
I'll come as soon as I can.
I was meaning to call you.
Do it quickly.
Your mother loves me.
The door was locked.
It's a great day.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
Will you do me a favor?
Tom should have followed Mary's advice.
No one knows where we are.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
May I go?
They won the kissing contest.
The rain prevented him from coming here.
I'm afraid I took the wrong train.
Have you seen Tom recently?
I think you're sitting in my seat.
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one.
I don't play that game.
They're having a going-out-of-business sale.
I bought her some drinks.
I've had enough.
You need to be careful when you're driving a car.
I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
I've been upset not having written you a reply.
Please don't forget to mail the letters.
The part of an iceberg under the water is much larger than that above the water.
What's up?
His car broke down on the way to work.
I'm not going to sign this.
He was educated by his grandfather.
Tom's parents got divorced when he was very young.
I can give you some useful information.
I can't let them catch you.
Why not just stay?
We got off on the wrong foot.
Many people who hear Tom speaking French think he's a native speaker.
There is no end in sight to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
Today's dinner is fish.
I'm not as busy as Tom.
It will not be long before spring comes.
That's never happened to us before.
I guess I was mistaken.
Pick it up.
Apparently my bare feet bothered him more than anything else.
Everyone is happy.
A baseball came flying through the window.
Please save my place.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
I'm pretty proud of that.
You speak like your mother.
We took shelter under a tree.
I wanted to make a few phone calls.
He was a famous poet and a competent diplomat.
I found the empty box.
This is for my friend.
I'm fasting.
Two detectives followed the suspect.
She greeted him waving her hand.
Unless there is a miracle, we won't be able to make it on time.
It's phony.
Tom contributed.
She often goes to the movies with him.
What if he comes back now?
Tom doesn't like being told what to do.
How come we're different?
Close the door.
He'll be here around four o'clock.
There are people who are afraid of spiders.
Let's forget about what happened yesterday.
I had forgotten how beautiful you are.
I did the right thing.
I didn't see you.
I left it on the table.
What time and where could we meet?
They called for an end to the fighting.
Let's go this way.
You should have seen him.
Nothing is as simple as it seems.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
I just kind of want to be alone right now.
You can't cancel the meeting.
You seem depressed.
It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.
I'm afraid I don't follow.
It's frustrating and confusing.
I get dizzy when I stand up.
She wouldn't even speak to him.
All you have to do is push this button to take a picture.
You're too tense.
The bridge was washed away by the flood.
Charity begins at home.
Words failed me.
Can you persuade him to join our club?
Industrial countries require a lot of skilled labor.
Do it at once.
They say that he knows the secret.
London is on the Thames.
Turn on the ignition.
Who said that?
See what happens when you give people advice?
He blamed me for the accident.
Forty years passed.
Tom is kidding.
How is that different?
There's no place like home.
Forget I said anything.
They were on board the same airplane.
I figured I'd find you here.
Look at the dog jump.
He rushed into the room with his coat on.
How long have you been teaching English?
He chose them at random.
Tom is an electrical engineer.
I'm drunk.
You were so strong.
You can't be too careful.
I did it for you.
His car collided with a train.
I went fishing last Monday.
I've never heard him speak ill of others.
Tom isn't dumb.
This policy is sure to go a long way towards stimulating business.
It seems that you're not having fun in here.
We're still married.
He is giving me a hard time.
I'm not getting involved.
We're all going home.
We should talk calmly to each other.
This is highly inefficient.
I can tell by his accent that he is German.
From now on, I'm going to be here for you.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
I will explain it to him.
That is not altogether bad.
You're faithful.
His speech made a good impression on me.
Did you hear the news?
It seems interesting to me.
She acted like a real baby.
An elephant is a strong animal.
Is anybody there?
We should've gotten up earlier.
Why did you make such a mistake?
I was momentarily blinded.
How many people were at your party?
These gifts are for you.
Why do stars twinkle?
How does that sound to you?
They didn't want me to examine it.
It doesn't surprise me that you know.
I really need to hit somebody.
She has a bad habit of chewing on her pencil.
There are many wild animals around here.
Please lie on your stomach.
Please sit down on this chair.
Tom didn't seem suspicious.
This is a special day for all of us.
He will be ready.
I slept all day yesterday.
Am I the only one who agrees with you?
I'll tell you what to say.
I've got my reasons.
A hypochondriac imagines maladies where none exist.
I never really knew what happened.
The wine was excellent.
You are mad.
He expressed his feelings in the form of a painting.
Do you want to be rich?
It's a long way from here to school.
Everybody laughed at Tom.
She is a wonderful wife.
Any bed is better than no bed.
You're the nicest girlfriend I ever had.
You probably eat genetically modified fruits and vegetables all the time without knowing it.
We had so much fun together.
How often do you have to see the dentist?
Don't make me come back here.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I'm suspicious of everybody.
It hadn't crossed my mind.
I felt like I was dead.
Where do you get your hair done?
I found the earring that you lost.
I think I can do better.
I don't want to go outside.
He gave an angry shake of his head.
He committed suicide to atone for his sin.
We slept in the same bed.
You must not lose sight of your goal in life.
I couldn't get that lucky.
I know you want to talk to Tom.
I have a dry cough.
I'm extremely fat.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Put it back where you found it.
Please replace the empty ink jet cartridge in the printer.
As we ate our meal, we talked about what we had done that day.
Are you finished with your work?
You don't have to explain.
I heard coughing.
I was lost.
I'd like to see Tom immediately.
Is he at home?
I expected this.
The attempt ended in failure.
These flowers bloom earlier than others do.
Tom went skiing alone.
Why would you ask that?
Why are you all laughing?
That costs 30 euros.
I'm not thinking about it.
I really can't make any promises.
Preheat the oven to 130 degrees.
He changed his mind.
He placed the book on the shelf.
You won't regret this.
I don't have any allergies.
Be nice.
She visited the school, despite a pain in her right arm.
Can he speak Japanese?
You missed a spot.
I can't focus on two things at the same time.
I'm glad you're early.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
Red-haired people tend to have freckles.
He is hated by everyone.
The child was told to apologize for being rude to the guests.
I needed Tom to do that.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
I don't know what this word means.
Do you really want Tom to do that?
It's a rough neighborhood.
Is it too small?
Don't disappear on me again.
It's a waste of time and money.
I can't condone what you did.
I wish you had told me the truth.
We need more time.
Why isn't anybody doing anything?
Tom made thirty thousand dollars last week.
Your French is improving.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
I just want to be your friend.
That's exactly how I feel.
I want another beer.
There is no limit to the universe.
I think that's up to you now.
Can you swim?
Is he all right?
My mother was crying.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
You can come home.
He got the first prize.
Do you know how to ride a horse?
Were you two close?
Where were you that whole time?
I think it's sad to have no friends.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
You know the drill.
You need to be more patient.
It's easy to fall into bad habits.
Please give me a hand.
I was naive.
Look out for pickpockets.
I'd like for you to leave.
She made him a new coat.
Don't be rude.
Do you want me to be your bodyguard?
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
What made you come here?
This couch is very comfortable.
I'm unambitious.
Everyone should choose at least one poem and learn it by heart.
Cars arrived there one after another.
Is love just a game for you?
Tom has already fallen asleep.
I'm not impressed.
I'll take care of that.
Put your hands up!
You're very religious, aren't you?
I know you're thinking about me.
Visitors to Switzerland admire the Alps.
The man controlled the country for fifty years.
This door will not open.
My brother and I shared the room.
I stayed home because of the rain.
He always wears dark clothes.
I won't tolerate such language!
It's yours.
I have relatives in Milan.
I'm well.
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
Are there enough chairs for everyone?
You're lucky you didn't die.
You'll do exactly as I say.
He touched me on the cheek.
We'll catch you.
It looks like Tom is in love.
He is too much of a coward to attempt it.
The view is beautiful beyond words.
If I'm not mistaken, I think we took a wrong turn back there.
Come back in a day.
He had few friends and little money.
I found the picture you were looking for.
Tom certainly gives the impression that he doesn't know what he's doing.
Manholes are round because that way they won't accidentally fall through the hole.
He's new in town.
Who did this?
I think I can answer that.
You're conceited.
What was the cause of your quarrel?
She cooks for him every day.
I hope you're wrong.
Some of the girls laughed.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
That's not important for you to know.
This book is about stars.
Why are you protesting against the government?
In the Southern region, sales were up 47 percent.
I asked myself that same question.
She married him even though she didn't like him.
Come on! We'll be late.
The horse stopped and wouldn't move.
I don't care about politics.
Is all of that necessary?
You're worse than Tom.
Would you like some more salad?
As soon as the results are made public, I'll let you know.
Where's your other brother?
Is reprinting this article a possibility?
Please don't laugh at me.
As we ate our meal, we talked about what we had done that day.
Here's the tricky part.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Let me reiterate what I've said.
I think you'd better go.
I have eyes.
Jump as high as you can.
We finished today.
I needed help.
I didn't expect you.
I found my father's diary that he kept for 30 years.
You know me well.
Our electric heater does not work well.
He's at church right now.
How did you come by this painting?
I don't think I can make it to your party.
What time did you go to bed last night?
The boy narrowly escaped drowning.
How could I lie to you?
Ask him for advice.
He saw suicide as the only way out.
I'll always remember your kindness.
Even though Tom used to be my best friend, I'm beginning to hate him.
We aren't always right.
My headache is gone.
How much is the commission?
Who are you talking with?
I fed the leftovers to my dog.
They mistook him for his brother.
Who is he?
Be quiet and get back in the car.
Let go of my hand.
He looked surprised.
She advised him to get more exercise.
I just want to be a good neighbor.
It seems to be serious.
Luck comes to those who look for it.
You're totally right.
We must speak.
What don't you have?
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your classmates.
Don't give up halfway.
A crowd gathered at the scene.
Where is the rubber duck?
We need you back.
Tom looks excited.
Open the door.
Where can I get some help?
His name is known to everybody in this area.
It's not yet time.
I think Tom is smarter than that.
Having been convicted of murder, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
You don't sound convinced.
I don't understand this at all.
They do not know how to do it.
He donated countless pieces to the museum.
I'm finished.
That's preposterous.
We've been through tougher times than this before.
Your garden needs some attention.
This isn't too hard for you, is it?
Tom helped his mother decorate the Christmas tree.
I'll make you happy.
No matter what I try, I can't seem to give up smoking.
You must be cautious.
I baked it for you.
It was such a wonderful movie that I saw it five times.
I wrote it.
Tom seemed fairly happy.
I can prove it to you.
Do you want to try it?
Could you give me a discount?
Turn left at the next corner.
He caught a large trout.
She watched him drawing a picture.

You can't help them.
How fast can you do it?

What gives you the right to ask?
Are you still interested?
We're just having a good time.

What are you trying to prove?
Someone stole all my money.
Whatever you do, don't forget this.
I think you must be getting tired.
The workers worked around the clock.
What's your beef?
He and his friend sat on the bench.
It was quite funny.
Tom is angry with us.
You're depressed, aren't you?
We must not speak in the library.
If blaming me makes you feel better, go right ahead.
I decorated it.
I can't quite place his accent.
How old is your daughter?
It seems he's still alive.
I heard the message.
Do you mind my smoking here?
The children are safe.
Stop acting like such a fool.
I have been a teacher for 15 years.
He's one of the best.
I'm here to protect you.
I didn't kill anyone.
I am not acquainted with him.

You're lazy.
His child behaves well.
You should have done it with us.
The police assembled a lot of evidence against him.
Which one is mine?
These mosquitos are eating me alive!
He chewed his gum.
He's attracted to black women.
She held him by the sleeve.
I've upset you.
Why don't you just back off?
He can't help you.
She had already gone to bed when I called her at 11 p.m.
You are taller than she is.
He seems interested in me.
Can you tell me the time, please?
You have to judge the case without bias.
How long do I have to wait for the next bus?
What is your specialty?
Did you say yes?
I don't want to bother you.
I'm glad that I didn't eat the food that made you sick.
It's going to be morning soon.
Did you read it all?
May I interrupt?
The police roped off the street near the spot.
My English teacher recommended that I read these books.

Hippopotamuses love water.
Tom won't be back for a week.
She has two thousand books.
Are you free for dinner tonight?
The wind is howling.
It's all yours.

A lot of trees were cut down.
I found out how to solve the problem.
Is there something in particular that you want to learn?
Have you put on sunscreen?
The main valve is turned off.
I wanted to hear you say that.
He's not my father.
I couldn't do that either.
I think you know that.
We're weak.
I'd like you to itemize the charges.
As the proverb says, "Time is money."
Tom didn't have to thank me.
The dog barks at all strangers.
I left you a note.
You get out only what you put in.
Choose your weapon.
Agriculture was developed more than 10,000 years ago.

I want a car that runs on solar power.
Did you see the transcript?
To our surprise, she has gone to Brazil alone.
It's hard to tell whether Tom dyes his hair or not.

One thing I've always wanted to do is get a decent job close to home.

Please don't speak so fast.
I love you for who you are.
Why don't you just back off?
Did you see the sunset earlier? It was really beautiful.
Tell me that was a joke!

Is there anyone here?

I'd like to see her.
I want to make sure I understand what you're saying.
I don't expect anything from you.
You don't need me anymore.
He was seized with fear.
When I last saw him, he was wearing a blue shirt and white slacks.
She has a large room all to herself.
Please don't go home.
Don't say it in a roundabout way.
There are exceptions to every rule.
Do you think I can use my cellphone in the shower?
The boy has an apple in his pocket.
I feel funny.

We'll manage.
Tom forgot to buy bread.
He plays very well.
Tell Tom that I'm too tired to help him.
Why didn't you come to the party?

We cried together.
I forgot to tell them.
Owls can see in the dark.
Have a safe trip.
I think we have a lot in common.
You're the oldest.
It's illegal to park your car here.
When will you come home?
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your classmates.
Everything's under control.
It's very likely that he'll be chosen.
Don't let the cat escape. Close the door!
I think you're both right.
After you have read it, give the book back to me.
I cut the article out of the magazine.

These books are easier than those books.
I hope we're going to do something worthwhile.
You don't need to prepare a formal speech.
Every time they talk, they argue.
He promised me that he would come at four.
Do you know Tom well enough to ask him to do this?
This is hers.

I'm really sorry, but I seem to have misplaced your scarf.
Sheep eat grass.
Kobe is the city where I was born.
How do I get to the train station?

Have you betrayed me?
I realize I may not be the most desirable man in the world, but I still hope you'll consider going out with me.
This watch is better than that one.
You had better put on your crash helmet.
You should go now.
Can you spell it?
He's waiting for you at home.
Seriously?
I thought it might be useful.

He managed to escape through a window.
I'm giving it back.

When will you leave?
I missed the train. I should have come earlier.
They were so happy together.
I don't care for wine.
It's redundant.
I am interested in swimming.

I could not attend the ceremony.
Is that really what you want?
If it is sunny tomorrow, we will go on a picnic.
She was wearing long boots.
I want to see him.
He has built up an excellent business.
There was nothing he could have done.
Have you seen their new apartment?
She smiled happily.
The trees were full of birds.
Sorry. It's all my fault.
Wait here till I come back.
Their teacher praised them.
Won't you come and see me this weekend?
He intends to buy a new bicycle.
I think it's time for me to turn on the radio.
What is your problem?
I saw you with Tom.
Thank you for your kindness.
A ball is floating down the river.
Her teacher praised her.
Who did you go there with?
I want to know who was in charge.
You're lazy.
Are you ready to begin?
I played with Tom and Mary today.
I'm slow to adapt to new situations.
Tom's my friend.
You can stay only if you are quiet.
It doesn't matter what I think.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
I'll do it, if you insist.
Old people have difficulty understanding modern technology.
How do I get reimbursed?
I remember writing to her.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
This is something I must face alone.
I know I can make it on time.
She works for a large American corporation.
She told him to try harder.
We have plenty of time.
Why is he so popular?
I really do hope we can still be friends.
I'm too old for you.
They went on vacation together.
I know that you know.
I came with my friends.
You said you didn't care.
I'm not sure what happened.
I don't remember you asking me to do that.
I'd like to know what's happening here.
I don't need to tell you anything.
It's still warm.
Tom rolled up his sleeves.
I want to talk to you alone.
My friend helped me.
I will have spent all this money in three months.
I was waiting for that question.
I'm beginning to smell a rat.
You should go talk to him.
Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.
You may swim.
I won't be quiet.
What's this chair doing here?
This wasn't cheap, was it?
I was never told that.
I don't believe that's true.
It freaks me out.
You shouldn't drink so much coffee late at night.
What're you all dressed up for?
It made me laugh out loud.
Women are all the same.
Come play with us.
Can you take a little break?
You're lucky that you have a job.
Is it free?
He has broad shoulders.
I can't tell you anything yet.
Tom doesn't need to know where I'm going.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I feel there is just no way out.
Are you going to a movie?
Would you carry this up to the second floor for me?
He turned over the business to his son.
I'd love to go to Boston with you.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
He took advantage of every opportunity he had.
What you did to Tom was cruel.
I deserve happiness.
The ocean was calm.
Don't let appearances fool you.
I doubt that.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle.
I've seen enough.
He denied having met her.
What will the weather be like?
You should do that.
The cops want you.
We appreciate your help.
Tom looked.
The petals floated on the surface of the water.
Making amends is the first step toward rehabilitation.
You can say whatever you want to.
I had my suitcase carried up to my room.
Did you come here by train or by bus?
Would you say it once more?
Do not do that.
Do you mind if I smoke here?
Sport is good for your health.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
He was surprised to hear about the murder case.
I had a quick breakfast.
I never make my bed.
It's a great honor to meet you.
I have a weird neighbor.
He did it all out of kindness.
Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
Will you stay here for a while?
Sign the guest book.
The old man died of cancer.
Most Japanese eat rice every day.
I won't let you die.
You've done it!
We wasted a lot of time looking for Tom.
I said stop.
Isn't this simply beautiful?
I don't think I really matter to you.
Context is important.
It is a long story.
Why don't I drive you?
He is respected by everyone.
My mother's going to kill me.
This software package has a suggested retail price of $99.

Could you lend me some money until this weekend?
I know how to do it.
I've never seen him before.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
Why didn't you come to the party?
I used to be fat like you.
Fish is cheap today.
I was singing.
I enjoy his company.
You missed a lot.
You can't control me.
It could be anybody.
I hope you're happy.
You must keep this machine free from dust.
I'll give you money if you need some.
It is easy for me to solve the problem.
Did he show you the picture?
I want you to let me go.
I don't want to lose this match.
Don't you feel like going to the movies?
I had no idea you were involved.
He hung a picture on the wall.
Please feed the dog every day.
I got what I came for.
I'm sorry.
I'm not who you think I am.
She was afraid of waking the baby.
Who did you vote for?
I'll wait here.
Are you out of your mind?
She seems to have left for Tokyo yesterday.
Would you like this?
We want to talk to you about that.
This is what happens when you don't pay attention to what you're doing.
They all stopped.
Do you play in a band?
Stay out of this.
Is someone knocking on the door?
I am yours and you are mine.
The airline sent my suitcase to Boston by mistake.
He dropped her a line.
In the last typhoon, the wind blew at over 200 kilometers per hour!
He held out his hand.
I came yesterday.
I haven't listened to any of his songs.
He'll be groggy for another few hours until the drug wears off.
It's quite good.
I was horrified.
I'm no different.
Listen carefully to what I say.
We're almost ready.
I thought he was here.
They meet once a week.
Very few people aren't afraid of death.
He often plays guitar.
I asked him to do that.
I think Tom is awake.
This is a frightening place.
I hate chemistry.
It is easy to play tennis.
I know Tom wanted to meet you.
What do you want me to do?
I went to Nagasaki.
Do you have health insurance?
Everyone did it.
I'd like to explain everything, but I don't think we have enough time.
Nothing can prevent her from marrying him.
I've tried them all.
I'm still not impressed.
You haven't even tried.
Why didn't you come to ask me earlier?
He has a little money.
I think Tom is hiding from Mary.
Is her house anywhere near the station?
She has a pretty face.
I almost believe you.
You didn't tell him anything?
I just want to be sure.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
You may be correct.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
Let's check it out.
Everyone is getting fidgety.
To tell the truth, I don't really care.
What's your GPA?
Your eccentricities can make you either charming or tedious.
I'd like to know how much the meal was because I'd like to pay my half.
I laughed out loud.
Are you good at keeping secrets?
A camel is, so to speak, a ship on the desert.
It's not in my contract.
The Sphinx began to walk around him.
Isn't there anything that will make you feel better?
You're very sharp.
We all make mistakes.
She sat next to him on the bus.
Why don't you ask me what you really want to know?
How did you come by all this money?
I got lost in the woods.
I'd love to sing for you.
You're the teacher.
How about your place?
Did you have fun last night?
The bus was hot and crowded.
Do you drink wine?
That's the only way to do it.
Did we forget anything?
Do you recognize them?
What did you eat for dinner?
Tom got more Christmas presents than Mary.
There is little wine left in the bottle.
I'm so sorry.
No, I don't want to.
It was a dry year, and many animals starved.
My parents are constantly arguing.
I want to keep my kids safe.
How do I look tonight?
I ran like lightning.
I only took a bite of bread.
Don't be alarmed.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
Their intimacy grew with the years.
You don't need to answer this question.
All of them are connected.
You can't compete with Tom.
Your question is hard for me to answer.
Japanese industry has made great advances since the war.
By the way, do you play the violin?
The national debt is growing.
Can you tell me about it?
I was waiting for a taxi.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
I'm not in the least afraid of it.
Did you write your name?
What do you want to learn?
An article about our school appeared in the newspaper.
What prompted you to move out?
I'm rational.
I got up early, so that I could catch the first train.
He died recently.
It's cold out here.
After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
You're not bad.
I just got a promotion.
She asked him out on a date.
Are you a maniac?
I don't know if I can make it without you.
I don't think he can help you.
I'm an artist.
Are you fully recovered?
The group was made up of six girls and four guys.
You can be anything you want.
I only wish that were possible.
I need volunteers.
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
The people here are really friendly.
Would you show me some rings?
I like her novel.
I only eat meat about three or four times a month.
I have seen this happen over and over again.
I guess I'd better be going.
I was just mugged.
She loves him now more than she did before.
He was at a loss what to do.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
My mother is a very good cook.
That plane will take off at five.
I know my father will help me.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
You can't pick who you fall for.
Hey, thanks for everything.
I'll make some calls.
I'd like to join your group.
I just wanted to check my email.
We both want it.
I'll understand if you don't want to go there with me.
You're very clever.
My father might be at home now.
Show me your passport, please.
The weather report said that there will be thunderstorms tomorrow evening.
Would you mind telling me one thing?
This is different from what I thought.
We all wish for happiness.
If it is fine tomorrow, we will play baseball.
You are to come with me.
You are the last person I expected to see here.
May I run with you?
That brings up another point I'd like to discuss.
Japan has caught up with Europe and America in medicine.
We need to call someone.
It never occurred to me that what I was doing might be illegal.
We're shaken.
I fear no one.
We're doing great.
Mine is not so good as yours.
That's what we all thought.
I'd be happy to sing for you.
You are in my way.
Please paint the door white.
You have to study hard to catch up with your class.
Are you sure that's necessary?
I really appreciate you meeting with me.
I wasn't hired.
I thought I might never see you again.
You're resilient.
What's your favorite way to travel?
It was long.
You're so sweet.
It took him a long time to take in what she was saying.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
Our army attacked the kingdom.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I was at the hospital a couple of days ago.
Everyone is responsible for his own actions.
You would be safe there.
I missed the train by only a few minutes.
She wrote a book about animals.
Let's unfold the map on the table and discuss it.
Am I allowed to use this?
I want to see him very much.
He has much more money than I have.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Not everyone was impressed.
Are you going, too?
Everyone can do better.
Do you really think that your plan is realistic?
Bring me today's paper, please.
Your plan seems better than mine.
I may need to move on.
That never happened.
Give me a cup of coffee.
She told me an interesting story.
Tom didn't even know I was here.
I will have left here before you return.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
I was younger then.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
Can you play an instrument?
Did you see that?
No one disagreed.
Have you ever been stuck in an elevator?
Is there a particular way I'm supposed to address you?
Bring the water to a boil.
Either they don't want to or they can't.
No one lives here anymore.
The origin of the fire is unknown.
Tom comes here every three days.
I should have left earlier.
The pleasure is mine.
I don't know about the others, but as for me, I'm for it.
They must be fake.
I got arrested.
What if something went wrong?
You nearly broke my jaw.
Was there much damage?
Would you please take my picture?
Tom seems to be an honest person.
How much did you spend on Christmas gifts this year?
She is rather poor at tennis.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
Somebody answered.
The wheel began to turn.
I returned Tom's book to him.
Are they satisfied?
It scared me, too, OK?
I speak only the truth.
I'm the type who likes to think things over very carefully.
I'll leave Boston tonight.
Tom must've taken the wrong train.
He nodded to me as he passed.
What did you do on your vacation?
I had my bicycle stolen.
I've been evicted.
Tom is someone I trust.
We need actions, not words.
Is she making a doll?
Pardon the interruption.
Who's he?
She was perfect.
As soon as I've finished doing that, I'll help you.
I didn't see you.
Wear whatever you want.
We wouldn't want to disobey the teacher, would we?
Saying and doing are two different things.
I know what he's thinking.
Not knowing what to answer, I kept silent.
Where did you hear that?
I told you so.
Will he be able to catch the train?
This is what he painted.
"Are you students?" "Yes, we are."
What's the purpose of your trip?
Read what's on the label.
That bus stops in front of my house.
I don't see any problem.
What we should do next is the question.
Why would you say that?
Tom is the most boring person I know.
The workers were naked to the waist.
Comb your hair before you go out.
We sure had fun, didn't we?
Tom could barely breathe.
He was my first boyfriend.
Everybody was obeying the speed limit, so I knew there was likely a speed trap ahead.
Go to your room.
We considered that.
You can do it.
This is a picture of the ship I was on.
Why don't we talk for a while?
I've heard rumors.
I have no one to go to for advice.
You made a fool of yourself.
Everyone was surprised.
He's not breaking the law.
Don't judge people by appearance.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
I feel I could've done better.
Leave it.
She loves shopping.
My father abandoned me when I was young.
I can't smoke.
The accident left a long, deep gash in the side of the airplane.
Put the scalpel down.
Did you sleep much last night?
What were you expecting?
I met her an hour ago.
My father and I played tennis on Sunday.
He likes my jokes.
My eyes are tired.
He does nothing but complain from morning till night.
Remember that we are all in the same boat.
"Where are your books?" "They are on the desk."
You don't want to do anything rash.
The shop stays open all day.
At last, they reached the top of the mountain.
So difficult was the question that no one could answer.
You don't have to talk.
The church is between my house and yours.
She is on a diet to lose weight.
I got fined.
I think he can get along with his neighbors.
I wrote some poems last weekend.
I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode.
They're stalling.
Do you need a ride?
Did Tom get hurt in the accident yesterday?
You can do anything you want, depending on what floats your boat.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
He made a mistake on purpose.
I can't shake off my cold.
Is that a bottle opener?
I question your loyalty.
Somebody stole it from me.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Don't make fun of that child.
I finally got a job.
Don't fail to come here by five.
The seats are all sold out.
You don't need to flatter your boss.
I don't know who you are.
The choice is all up to you.
We might need to help Tom.
You'd be better off staying home.
That's the way it is.
It's no use asking me for money.
That's much more important.
I asked the doctor some questions.
Avoid crossing this street when it is raining.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
Is it hard to fool you?
I want you to get your own place.
It’s not a bug, it’s an undocumented feature.
Why don't you take the day off?
It's a beautiful job.
She suggested that I give it to him right away.
We received instructions on how to make a bamboo basket.
Are they coming, too?
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
That's cheap, isn't it?
Is this seat vacant?
Tom isn't really Canadian.
I felt sad.
This box contains apples.
I'll give you a couple examples.
We just want Tom to keep working.
How cool is this?
Can I set a place at the table for you?
We spent more money than was expected.
Half of the bananas in the basket were rotten.
You look really good.
They're lucky to be alive.
Tom is determined to help Mary.
I don't know what to eat for dinner.
You're never at home.
I'll buy you a drink.
He ordered me to sweep the room.
Someone stole something from my bag.
Why don't you run for student council?
I negotiated the price with him.
The dog barked at the stranger.

I'll make this up to you.
I felt very happy.
Tom thinks you're lying.
Stop the car.
How did he find us?
Can you write a letter in English?

You're really selfish.
It's about four blocks from my house.

I don't understand German.
Tom went to the park with Mary.
I'm not joking.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
Could you show me this bag?
He has powerful connections in the publishing industry.
Why's everyone whispering?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Have you begun studying English?
Oh please!
Somebody saw you.
Can you watch the kids?
I'm glad you liked it.
Don't they drive you mad?
It is a pity that he has no sense of humor.
I saw you there.
Tom bought a house in Boston.
I don't understand why Tom brought you here.
The weather was miserable yesterday.
You'll have a rough time.
They found the stolen money.
I'll eat anything.

This guy is an outlaw.
Thank you for helping me out.
I can hear you loud and clear.
You can't hypnotize me.

The washing machine is a wonderful invention.

He likes collecting old coins.
I love the food here.
Tom walked to the front of the room.
Which cup will he choose?
That's a brilliant idea.

The game is over.
Generally speaking, Japanese are hard workers.
Winter is coming soon.
Your question has no answer.

I'm putting all my effort into this project.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
I have visited Boston three times.
A sentence doesn't have to be long to be beautiful.
Did you enjoy that?
I'm happy with it.

I'm sorry, but I can't find the book you lent me.
I want you to get in your car.
That's not even the worst part.
It was sort of fun.
I wish I were rich.
They're thirty dollars each.
No proof was ever found.
Keep the money in a safe place.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
I got home first.
He told me that he would visit Nara next month.
Do you have plans for dinner?
I wish you did not have so many problems.
Who invented this machine?
He can run faster than I can.

Our car ran out of gas after ten minutes.
I have a friend waiting for me in the lobby.
His theory is based on fact.
I'll pay you.
How can I tell if I'm really in love?
I haven't seen you for a while.
I'm sorry, but I didn't catch what you said.
Light the candle.
I want to write a letter.
I was born in Kyoto.
It's pathetic.
It appears that she might change her mind.
I'm not embarrassed.
Why don't you admit your mistake?
Do you enjoy losing?
It looks fine.
I think you misunderstood what I said.
She advised him to take a long holiday, so he immediately quit work and took a trip around the world.
I want you to stay here until I get back.

What should I do to find a suitable job for myself?
I will sleep at my aunt's.
Tom got up and walked to the door.
Where are they?
Tom hasn't eaten anything in the past 36 hours.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
It was a pleasant day, but there were few people in the park.
He is not at all a gentleman.
You're famous.
I want to teach you something.
It's still mine.
You can't talk to me that way.
No one thinks that way anymore.
We're ready to go.
It's two miles from here to the station.
That girl looks boyish.
I don't have time to explain.
The time women spend doing housework is now a lot less than it used to be.
What've you done?
Is she married?
He teaches Arabic.
Why are you leaving so soon?
Step aside.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Nowadays, almost every home has one or two televisions.
You've grown up, Tom.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
I asked Tom if I could talk to him in private.
He was declared guilty.
Tom knew too much.
Pencils are sold by the dozen.
I'm calling from my cell phone.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
Do you see that ship near the island?
It's obvious.
I think this project is moving on the right track.
He touched me.
I just wanted to say thanks.
Stop grumbling.
I must buy a new winter coat.
We've done something similar to that in the past.
The baby cannot use a spoon yet.
She sat next to him on the bus.

Come on in!
What are you doing here this time of night?
Not everybody is the same.
I made no mistakes.
Are you tired?
I understand now why he didn't go to a university.
He felt uneasy.
There are many Japanese restaurants in New York.
He stopped drinking.
He impressed me with his magic tricks.
We've only got one chance.
There is a large parking lot in front of the station.
I'm just writing a letter to my girlfriend.
Everybody's happy.
They were so happy together.
Do you have time the day after tomorrow?
I tried to help her.
Don't you want to put in another disc? We've been listening to this one for two hours.
I didn't tell anyone.
The baby is growing up.
She talks everything over with her parents.
I do not like music.
Look at her putting on airs over there.
Many young people came to Moscow to study.
I am divorced.
Give me your hand.
Can you keep a secret?
I realize it's probably too late.
Do you remember the day when we saw the accident?
Call Tom.
It was white.
I know you must be afraid.
Is it serious?
Is he interested in me?
My wife was mad.
I don't want to play golf.
I just learned six new facts about wombats.
I've done everything.
Tom didn't know Mary was so funny.
That's the whole story.
When did you finish writing the letter?
Tom could help you.
There are some things that you should never try doing.
I made a list of people I wanted to invite to my party.
I only want to help you.
This fact must not be forgotten.
He's kind of cute, isn't he?
Children usually have faith in their parents.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
I felt like my life was over.
I love visiting Boston.
Don't ever call me again.
Help is on its way.
He painted the door blue.
All living things on earth depend one another.
You don't know until you've had a child what pain you can feel when something happens to them.
Do you know the girl waving at us over there?
I want you to know what really happened.
The world isn't perfect.
What a great idea!
It's one of the basic human instincts.
He hates himself.
I can't do this without you guys.
I didn't do much work today.
Tom is refusing to pay his bills.
Don't you know who that is?
Some people clung to tree branches for several hours to avoid being washed away by the floodwaters.
The story is full of holes.
Let's get to know each other.
Is there a flower shop in the hotel?
The results were very satisfactory.
I put on my trousers.
Are you sure of it?
You're taller than me.
They'll be all right.
You can't quit now.
Do you drink coffee?
Where's your mother?
There is a place for everyone in the world.
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
Our car is three years older than yours.
I was in all day.
I think we've waited long enough.
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
He swims like a fish.
I have an uncle who lives in Kyoto.
I love autumn.
Are we all here?
I skipped out on my appointment with my boss.
Meat decays quickly in warm weather.
The taxi picked up two passengers.
I'm looking forward to visiting your country this winter.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
I'm in good health.
Let's take a picture.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
I'm not telling you.
Don't trust what he says.
They chose me for that.
Don't push it.
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
I'm a careful man.
The red hat goes well with her dress.
I had a call from her for the first time in a long time.
I am yours and you are mine.
I am not quite sure if we can meet your requirements.
I'll do whatever you want.
I have been honest with him.
I couldn't have said it any better myself.
I'm looking for a part-time job.
Is it a compliment?
Don't be fresh to me.
I saw the two together on several occasions.
I had a rough day.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
My wife catches colds easily.
There are many people trying to buy houses.
Do you know anyone here?
He is sure of success.
You're always anticipating trouble.
Someone has to pay the bill.
That's nonsense.
Keep quiet!
He is out of the office.
Why don't they just come and get us?
How long do you plan to stay in this country?
The new museum is worth visiting.
You're completely delusional.
I thought Tom and Mary were both dead.
Between meals, he usually manages to stow away a generous supply of candy, ice cream, popcorn and fruit.
I don't want to talk to you about this.
You're nice.
You should find a more constructive way of venting your anger.
You're no saint.
I am sure of her success.
How do you propose we solve this problem?
My mother anticipates all my desires.
You can't do two things at once.
They camped on the beach.
You can go wherever you want to go.
I can look at it when you're ready.
He has all kinds of books.
How's your married life?
I could hardly hear him.
I just want to say I love you.
You look nice with your hair short.
I'm seeing her this evening.
All you have to do is to make a comment.
Let's list all the reasons not to do that.
I want to know how this happened and why.
It was just a joke. Lighten up!
I did this for you.
I'll be watching you.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
Any questions?
Tom loved his family very much.
I don't know who they are, but they don't look friendly.
They complained of the room being too hot.
I'm wet.
What's your favorite spectator sport?
Did they write a letter?
I'm glad you weren't here.
We got ready.
I am not the person I used to be.
My wife did not attend the party and neither did I.
She went with him to the zoo.
Look before you leap.
She usually walks to school.
Her anxiety was apparent to everyone.
Foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious.
That was the basic idea.
It isn't easy to learn a foreign language.
Tom shut the door and locked it.
The artist always painted alone.
He set out for Tokyo this morning.
During warm weather, sweating helps man regulate his body temperature.
My grandmother was pulling up weeds in her backyard.

That's sufficient.
Many of the things Pizzaro had heard about the Inca treasure were true.
Let me get my wallet.
Do you want to talk about anything?
Don't you want to go out?
Don't close the door.
I hope that your brother is better.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Read it once more.
We had to react quickly.
The restaurant was far from the train station.
I want to know what you think.
Are you dressed?
He is what is called a man of action.
Please close the door quietly.
That's just not right.
You're very timid.
I have an ache in my arm.
What a lazy teacher!
I did a lot today.
I'd like some more bread, please.
Can you see anything over there?
Tom should have told me earlier.
You must do it yourself.
What did you eat for breakfast?
It's hard to argue with Tom.
It's for you to decide.
I can't understand what she says.
Can't we start again?
It's not as bad as it seems.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
Where did they go?
I don't like that at all.
You're lazy.
How is your wife?
Tom was dismissed from his job.
If you calculate the electric field using this equation, the result comes out like the following.
I'm going on a trip.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
When did he say he would come?
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
Tom wants to join our club.
I want to make a complaint.
I love summer rain.
I never blamed you.
I guess what I've said isn't all that clear, but that's the only way I can explain it.
Tom was wearing a baseball cap.
I look forward to seeing you again very soon.
I'll see you later, OK?
If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.
I need to ask you a favor.
I hate paperwork.
The ice sheets are melting.
He's a talented writer.
We won't go back to Boston.
I know you're busy, too.
They were all there.
He is drunk.
Everything is different today.
I prefer to go alone.
You're very flexible.
The children broke the ancient urn.
Do you mind if we join you?
That's what I'd want.
How about going to the movies on Saturday?
I actually have to run.
How nice!
How about a cup of hot coffee?
He doesn't care much for baseball.
I don't have one.
Who is playing the piano?
The front windshield of a car was smashed to pieces.
Don't buy your car from that dealership. They'll rob you blind.
We're all the same.
Will it rain today?
I don't know how old I am.
I appreciate your restraint.
Guide dogs help blind people.
The car replaced the bicycle.
She misses him, especially on rainy days.
He is having lunch now.
I'm afraid we'll lose the game.
I feel like I'm going mad.
You can't drink the water here.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
Tell me your story. I am all ears.
Tom has a ten-speed bicycle.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Please get dressed.
I haven't eaten in four days.
That's altogether wrong.
Be nice to her.
Tom said he'd rather not see that movie.
I'll reconsider the matter.
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
I feel like I'm going mad.
I'll be in my office.
You don't sound very surprised.
I will miss you.
You can't just make everyone do what you want them to.
My dream went up in smoke.
The problem is that our car will not be available on that day.
Watch the door.
Tom knocked on the front door.
Tom easily guessed Mary's password.
I told her what to do.
She was anxious about her children's health.
He couldn't find the house.
Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
That was quick.
We need to help each other.
She was not seriously injured.
She quietly entered the room.
I'm not feeling very hungry right now.
It makes no difference who I meet.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
Do you want to use mine?
I like traveling.
I'm not very patient.
Can you imagine him driving such a splendid car?
I never thought Tom would follow me here.
I need something for a child.
Stop being so naive.
I was a healthy child.
Does the medicine act quickly?
Do you have a camera?
I wish I had known how to do it.
The number of people who go abroad has been increasing.
May I request a favour of you?
Books such as these are too difficult for him.
I need you.
They greeted each other warmly.
I took a shower and then went to bed.
I think I'm in love.
It's two o'clock in the morning.
He made up his mind to be a pilot.
The new building is enormous.
Can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant?
Is it your fault or ours?
Tom's a nice guy. Everyone likes him.
What does this sign mean?
We're all on the same team.
The steak is well done.
You may swim.
He blew out the candles on the cake.
I have not heard from her recently.
Don't you have any good news?
They are our guests.
I raised my hand to ask a question.
Keep it together, Tom.
Be there tonight.
I'll tell you when we get there.
It is now necessary to add another rule.
I had to study English.
Where are the eggs, please?
I'm so confused right now.
Now I'm wide awake.
She gets up early.
My father bought this hat for me.
I nearly starved.
I've got nothing in my fridge.
I thought you had more sense than that.
I thought I was going crazy.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
I know your problem.
I saw him.
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
I cannot afford a camera above 300 dollars.
Would you like to sit at the counter?
I'm not naive.
Can't you hear the sound?
Everyone has their own style.
I'll prove it to you.
You are the one.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like me?
I suddenly became dizzy.
I had business to take care of.
The quality of their products has gone down over the years.
I can't stop watching.
I'm not busy either.
Take care of your health.
I hope he will come.
Can you loan me a pen?
Why did I do that?
I felt guilty.
Tom and Mary look surprised.
She wouldn't give him the time of day.
I really am glad you're here.
Take your time.
Their cattle are all fat.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
I don't know what to call you.
Do your best.
Anybody can make a mistake.
I realize that there's a problem.
I'm living my dream.
Is there a hospital around here?
Everything in this store is overpriced.
Her husband is about to die.
They did the right thing.
Tom seems nice.
We're survivors.
They found each other.
Tom took the ring off his finger.
We're still underage.
I came back home late.
You're upset.
He had a copy made of this key.
I know you're not scared.
I only found out a couple days ago.
I love the way you kiss.
Have we understood each other?
I really appreciate your coming.
It's fun to learn slang words in foreign languages.
What are my responsibilities?
Leave this to me.
The other one doesn't work.
It's really awesome.
Have a seat, won't you?
How about a snack?
Don't you know me at all?
I don't think anything changes.
I woke up early this morning.
At last, I caught up with my friends.
I can't go in there.
I do not feel sad.
I remember one poem in particular.
Do you still have Tom's umbrella?
Can you see it?
You should be proud of yourselves.
I lost my camera the other day.
She forgot that she bought him a present.
You've been suspended.
What's your natural hair color?
Do you have someplace to stay?
Few students can read Latin.
I think you've done enough.
So what is it you want me to do?
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
Does he like Japan?
Tom didn't tell his parents that he had gotten an F on the test.
She hugged him.
I guess you know I've missed you.
They hunted foxes.
Where's the pan lid?
Can you get Tom to a safe place?
Tom corrected himself.
He is eager to go there.
Tell me a bedtime story.
Do you really want to know?
He did the right thing.
I don't have a car.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
He continued walking for a while.
The paper is white.
There was a steady increase in population.
Tom found something.
I will definitely attend your funeral.
I'll handle it.
Cows supply milk.
Tom doesn't have a TV at home.
Where's the bag?
He was not a good politician.
Tom's answer was surprising.
He took off his clothes.
This is a nice place.
I want to dance.
This should be plenty.
I've upset you.
All Tom does nowadays is study.
I'll lend it to you.
Close the window before going to bed.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
You're just a boy.
Don't be fresh to me.
They left without me.
Will the train leave on time?
I have a lot to do today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to have this discussion at another time.
I hope you can forgive me.
I just want to know why.
I love you more and more each day.
Who volunteered?
He seems to have lived in Spain.
We remember.
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
I need new tires.
Two vanilla ice creams please.
Why not apply for that job?
I'm glad I hired you.
Are you doing anything special this evening?
I hope you understand.
They broke off their engagement.
Can my friend sleep over tonight?
Our friendship did not last.
He is said to have made a fortune in oil.
I want to know what's on that train.
Why don't you give me a break?
Just take my word for it.
It is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands.
Where have you been lately?
It's impossible to find parking around here.
Do you mind if we come in?
It's more complicated than I originally thought.
I haven't gotten over my bad cold yet.
Can you guess where I am right now?
What kind of shots did they give you?
It was wise of you to accept his offer.
He is a man of wisdom.
Where do the airport buses leave from?
I haven't seen you in ages.
Do you use all this stuff?
Let him in.
Does she like oranges?
Do you remember saying that?
If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam.
I always buy expensive items on credit.
He's sleeping like a baby.
I want to talk to you after class.
I'm getting used to it.
Christmas falls on Sunday this year.
I had a raincoat on so I didn't get so wet.
You said your boss was a nice guy.
I can't believe you just did that.
Do you want to stay?
What was the first concert you went to?
This is not about money.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
Her condition grew worse last night.
I've won first prize!
He introduced his daughter to me.
I'm baffled.
Should I wait for you here?
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
Is there anything else you'd like?
You have a point there.
You’d better lie low for a few weeks.
This book is too difficult for you to read.
We discussed the problem for a long time.
I'm breast-feeding my baby.
I have a ten-year-old boy.
The dressing room is over there.
I can't see.
Can I drive the tractor?
You're going to have to do better than that.
You are blinded by love.
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.
You can trust him. He'll never betray you.
My son grew 5 inches last year.
You've always been that way.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
It was really cold on Tuesday.
I know we're a little early.
What has become of your sister?
I no longer want that.
I don't want your gold.
He gave me not only advice but also money.
A trip to Hawaii will cost you about 200 dollars.
The box was full of books.
Tom can walk on his hands.
She gave him a present.
I hear you were grounded.
I'm leaving.
We found that everyone was asleep.
It was really cold.
She wouldn't be happy with him.
Tom agrees.
I'm employed by a French lawyer.
My boss is a slave driver.
He dislikes unexpectedness and emergencies of any kind.
What's all this stuff?
You don't seem too surprised.
Finish your work quickly.
Have a safe trip.
You said it yourself.
Tom asked me where I lived.
Tom is asleep on the couch.
My neighbor renovated her house completely.
Did you know that in Japan, if you have a tattoo, you won't be allowed to bathe in many of the hot spring resorts?
She almost never does what she says she's going to do.
We have the whole summer to play.
He wants to talk to you.
I didn't do it for you.
How can I prove it?
Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news.
Is ten thousand yen enough?
I'm being honest with you.
He's not stronger than me.
I don't know what it's for.
Remain seated, please.
I did my job.
If you visit New York, you've just got to come and see our house.
It's a rainy day.
Why are you with me?
I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble.
Tom thought it would be a good idea to leave early.
You don't have a lot to say, do you?
I'm not proud of that.
She carried that table by herself.
Tom has decided to put off his departure.
I can't figure this out.
The earthquake triggered a powerful tsunami.
He sounded very tired on the phone.
You should go to bed.
She said that she was eager to go there.
Tom could do that.
Would you introduce yourself?
The water flooded the streets.
Give it a shot.
I believe you'll get over it soon.
How do you spell that word?
Why are you lying?
I saw the person I expected standing there.
It's all we have.
She advised him not to use too much salt, but he wouldn't listen to her.
Is that unusual?
We went to the café that I told you about.
My bike is not anything like yours.
I think that it's going to rain soon.
I like this song.
I was happy to help you.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
I think that's awful.
I made a decision.
She persuaded him to do it even though she knew it wasn't a good idea.
You don't look like your dad.
Look out of the window.
Are we all going to die?
He is well spoken of by everybody.
Don't be afraid of seeing the doctor.
He's been teaching for 20 years.
I have misjudged you.
This is a strange sentence.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
You're not helping, Tom.
I want some of those.
I'm used to it.
You said your boss was a nice guy.
The book costs 4 dollars.
Tom is sleeping like a baby.
Are you good at cooking?
They made him work from morning till night.
Did he touch you?
He finds faults with everything I do.
I'm being watched.
You are always doubting my word.
Carrots are good for the eyesight.
I don't know how to handle this.
She combed her hair and bound it with a ribbon.
What a lovely dress!
She took the news calmly.
My parents know about it.
I think that might be a good idea.
There's been a death in his family.
You let me down.
The weather today is worse than yesterday.
Students are supposed to study hard.
She worries about my health.
She has about as many stamps as I do.
I already said no.
Is everybody busy?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
Tom was mauled by a dog when he was a kid.
Tom is old enough to decide for himself.
What's your blood type?
Could I have money for my piano lesson?
We don't make mistakes.
I don't want to be tied to one company.
That's not reasonable.
I see how you did that.
What is he up to?
Tom called Mary last night and encouraged her to join the team.
I had the exact same feeling.
She seems happy.
Where is the nearest telephone?
He was very old.
Tom seems a little disoriented.
"But don't you think that it's a little big?" asked the shopkeeper.
Do you have any ideas about it?
It's finally over.
What kind of fool do you think I am?
I submitted the application myself.
I know what to do.
I noticed him sitting with his back against the wall.
I didn't see anything strange.
The ball rolled across the road.
Lawyers and auto mechanics are the people I trust the least.
We need to be a little more efficient.
There are six people including him.
As far as I know, she has not yet married.
How did I do?
Bring it back when you're done.
Can you believe this is really happening?
You're finicky.
I know Tom doesn't speak French.
You're doing all you can.
Is that your car in the driveway?
My patience is wearing thin.
Do you think it'll fit?
You gotta get more organized.
Don't say anything.
Take mine.
Tom suddenly realized he wasn't alone.
Can you still remember the time we first met?
I had to work last weekend.
I'm the only one who survived.
May I eat a little of it?
I'm glad Tom was able to see you while you were in Boston.
I'm never at home on Sundays.
I just don't want to talk to you.
Do you smell that?
I've never trusted strangers.
Are you telling me how to do my job?
He stole a glance at the girl.
That child can count to twenty.
Tom scares everybody.
Can you tell us about it?
Tom caught a whole string of fish.
You can wait for me here.
It is hardly raining.
Darwin changed everything.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
How about playing golf tomorrow?
Every mistake made me stronger.
Should we go?
I think it's time for me to speak up.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
I am coming.
Tom's at the door. Please ask him to come in.
Are you in Paris?
I'm delighted to be here.
This isn't a game.
Feel this. It's really soft.
Wash your feet.
I felt as if I had no choice.
You like everyone.
I won't pretend I'm sorry.
What do you want for breakfast?
We're not throwing it away.
This is old news.
He died of a heart attack on the stage.
Do you know what this is called?
Tom found a hundred dollar bill on the street.
Don't handle my books with dirty hands.
I can't stand listening to loud music.
I'm glad you brought that up.
This is what I was waiting for.
I can't believe they made us pay.
What did you want to see me about?
I am very glad to be out of high school.
I really don't sing.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
Why did you come here today?
Are you Chinese or Japanese?
He slipped on a banana peel.
I want to cry.
We're the same age.
It's not legal to keep wild animals as pets.
I'm not outgoing.
They're all dead.
I think you have my umbrella.
Who yelled?
Tom took a lot of photographs.
Weather permitting, we will leave in an hour.
Calm down, son.
I'm watching you.
This grocery store only sells organic food.
Mother made a doll for me.
I'm not cleaning that up.
I was all by myself.
I know that she doesn't know who I am.
I was watching.
I was bitten by a lot of insects in the forest.
You've been warned.
I'm interested.
Foreigners often feel unwelcome here.
This is Room 839.
He has no friends to advise him.
This is the right answer.
How is your last name written?
The smell was unbearable.
Tom returned to his office.
It's too late to do anything about that now.
You're very wise.
How many did you take?
What is the matter with you?
The car won't start because the battery has run down.
Did you vote yet?
Do you fly frequently?
You're not a doctor.
I know exactly how you feel.
Why does everybody love cats?
I'm not selling you my car.
Would you be willing to help?
Where did you find the key?
I didn't realize my wallet was missing until I got home.
She loved her mother dearly.
We grew up together.
I feel like going to bed early tonight.
I'm bleeding.
Have you ever been on TV?
You are not supposed to smoke here.
Please lower the window.
I know this is hard.
I think you shouldn't be doing that.
He has a lot of difficulty seeing without his glasses.
He is lost in thought.
A caravan of fifty camels slowly made its way through the desert.
I treat everybody the same.
We're all at risk.
Choose any one from among these.
I hear that she's a famous actress.
Who do you think will come first?
You should spend more time studying than you do.
What would I do if something happened to you?
I want these.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Every crime must be punished.
How dare you speak like that to me?
There were no more free seats.
Shut the door.
Don't tell anybody.
I don't recognize this shirt. Whose is it?
Phew! That was close!
I can't compete.
I told you this was going to be boring.
Tom doesn't have the right to say that.
Tom is my only real friend.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I'm glad you were able to meet Tom.
Humans are healed, but machines are repaired.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Have I answered your question?
I think this must be the place where Tom lives.
You should be careful in your choice of friends.
I think Tom died.
You can say whatever you want.
This one is on me.
Tom promised he wouldn't do that anymore.
Be sure not to eat too much.
Japanese young people like rock and jazz.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
Possibly the factory will be closed down next week.
Don't do anything you might regret.
Does that make you angry?
Tom is not going to be happy about this.
Mary pretended she was sick to avoid going to school.
Can we afford all this?
I usually get up at 6:00.
I can't stand kids.
I appreciate your vigilance.
Please fasten your seat belt during takeoff and landing.
What happened here?
He has an inferiority complex.
She handed him his jacket then opened the door and asked him to leave.
I've already tried that once.
Eat your soup while it is hot.
Let's hit the showers.
The police didn't book Tom for murder.
I didn't say that.
This soup tastes really great.
Do you think it's dangerous to eat genetically modified food?
We hugged each other.
I know everything.
I want to share my thoughts with you.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
His advice counted for little.
You're not very funny.
He has wine.
It's not a fair fight.
I'm the boss.
Tom enjoys telling jokes.
He defeated his opponent in the election.
Just don't tell anyone, OK?
I didn't flunk.
Whose is this bicycle?
I'm done with you.
Stop playing hard to get.
Sometimes it's hard to resist the impulse to burst out laughing.
He learned golf by watching others and following their example.
I learned to cook from my mother.
I extended my holiday.
Is that all you wanted to tell us?
They made me go there.
We have no complaints.
It was that dog that bit my hand.
Which newspaper would you prefer?
There's a long line at every cash register.
Tom waited for me.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
Let me think it over, and I'll let you know later.
What do you know about Tom's girlfriend?
He wants to learn to swim.
Do you want this shirt?
Why would I tell anyone?
I hear that he's still alive.
Which bed do you want to use?
I study Korean.
I found the book easy.
Rice is cultivated in several parts of the world.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
I guess I'm just a little sleepy.
You are very dear to me.
I'd do anything to protect you.
Who are you waiting for?
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
A friend to everybody is a friend to nobody.
The child is sleeping on his stomach.
You're pretty good.
His anger is understandable.
The only language Tom can speak is French.
He is actually not the manager.
I was the worst student in the class.
Why do you keep giving him money?
I hope we didn't wake you.
He is a student.
You've misunderstood.
Do we have to get up early tomorrow morning?
My sister is married.
We'll be back after the break.
He arrived as soon as he could.
I bought a new television.
Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think you'd go out with me.
It's just a dream.
He denied everything.
Don't you recognize that man?
The train is 30 minutes overdue.
It won't be long before we can start.
Did you actually see it?
After days of warm weather, it became cold.
Give it back to her.
I believe what is written in her letter.
Do you feel it, too?
He has not come yet. Something may have happened to him.
I must organize my thoughts.
I think Tom is dependable.
They were not impressed.
It's what we expected.
Do you like the way you look?
The door's unlocked.
It is so dreadful that I don't want to think of it.
I yelled at Tom.
You love your work, don't you?
I accept your conditions.
Even after twelve months, Tom can't accept that it's over between him and Mary.
Glass is breakable.
I just really need some time alone.
I thought I heard someone in the kitchen.
The origin of the universe will probably never be explained.
How are you feeling this morning?
I'm just going to run down to the bank.
You can't do that here.
They abandoned the sinking ship.
He has to be taller than me.
He didn't try to answer her back.
What do you say to playing cards?
This is hilarious.
You're fun.
You don't have to hurry.
He is likely to come.
What time is your curfew?
Didn't you read the prospectus?
Tom is the only person who can help me.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
That movie isn't as interesting as the original.
I was disgusted.
How does it feel to be back home?
He explained to me that he had no money.
Tom said you were good at chess.
We got lucky.
Thanks for coming.
Could you tell me how to adjust the volume?
As soon as the bell rang, we got up.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Do you feel like dancing?
They are my friends.
When is good for you?
Our concert has been postponed.
We will only consent on that condition.
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
This is insoluble in water.
I'm good at Japanese.
He's no saint.
Did I hear you right?
This telephone is out of order.
Don't judge me.
Are we ready?
Let's go for a ride in my car.
Call me at this number.
I fell.
She advised him to go there alone.
She startled him.
They treat their employees well.
It's okay as long as no one finds out about it.
She's a soccer champion.
He has to speak English.
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.
Tom didn't keep me waiting long.
You are to do as I tell you.
Men are simple.
I want to stay outside.
The boy told me why he was crying.
Please help yourself to the fruit.
You need to decide what kind of person you want to be.
How old will you be next year?
You must have seen them there.
All right, everyone, remain calm.
Are you a student here?
Tom asked Mary to look after the children.
I want this suit cleaned.
When does school let out for the holidays?
I saw a dog crossing the street.
Will he ever forgive me?
Dating is exhausting.
You should not wear a fur coat.
I want your opinion.
Will it snow tonight?
Choose one.
Have you told her mother?
Tom is convinced that his mother doesn't want to eat now.
Who took part in the contest?
I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
Look out for rock slides.
Let's call a spade a spade.
I had to do something.
Everyone is gone now.
I'm glad you're all right.
I went home in order to change my clothes.
We're going north.
The parking lot in the back of the school is almost empty.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
We can't turn back now.
She has been busy since yesterday.
He has recently made remarkable progress in English.
I was impressed.
They had good chemistry.
Let me try.
Don't let her go out after dark.
The man is eating bread.
He gathered up his things and left.
For example, do you like English?
He's a weak-willed man.
I don't eat out very often.
I'll see you in court.
Science has discovered that there are five types of human beings.
The time for talking is over.
We'll be working together.
Fasten your seat belt.
What are you majoring in?
I had intended to go with Tom.
Your name and flight number, please?
What kind of sports do you do?
This is just the beginning.
You get out only what you put in.
I want to thank you.
Let's take a short cut.
They talked about culture.
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
I love you all.
He had a kind word and a pleasant smile for everyone.
He suggested a plan similar to mine.
She will come if you ask her.
His kindness touched my heart.
I'm not scared.
Do you think her story is false?
You must show respect to your guests.
I don't deserve your friendship.
I don't consider Tom a friend.
I know I have a lot to learn.
That's not what you used to say.
Some people still believe that the world is flat.
Nobody can beat me.
I like that answer.
That mountain is five times as high as this one.
He was perfect.
The first time is free.
Can this news be true?
Tom was upstairs.
There is a man at the door.
Many families eat dinner while watching TV.
May I use the toilet?
We're fine.
I made him cry.
Be punctual.
The other team has some really good players.
I refused to believe it.
Fluency in English is a very marketable skill today.
The hotel was designed by a Japanese architect.
There is a photo of Tom on Mary's desk.
He has been in Japan for two years.
I'm looking forward to the next time.
You're opportunistic.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
I think Tom knows what he's doing.
How many of these things have you made?
Stop poking me on Facebook.
Oh, don't be so modest.
You shouldn't share too much private information on the social networks.
I don't like profanity.
Is your school far from your home?
I paid for it already.
You ought to have taken your father's advice.
It doesn't hurt at all.
We watched TV after lunch.
They announced that they were going to have a party.

What are you talking about?
Would you like another piece of cake?
What's your son's name?
What time shall I pick you up?
She spoke Japanese well.
We need to study more.
Are you happy with your weight?
That's not exactly a top priority.
He was sitting on the floor.
In a court of fowls, the cockroach never wins his case.
Tom contributed.
Don't change your mind so often.
In life there are ups and downs.
I've had enough.
Why didn't it work?
He's not at all afraid of snakes.
Tom gave Mary another wink.
I appreciate your directness.
They let me go.
Hurry up. The train leaves in ten minutes. We don't want to miss it.
He was heard singing the song.
The meeting was just about over.
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
Wait here until I come back.
There is an urgent need for qualified teachers.
My father stopped drinking.

We'll have to find another option.
Tom was trying to control his anger.
May I sit here?
Tom can speak German as well as English.
I went camping with my family.
Does Tom know Mary is here?
I don't know anything about their relationship.
I often played baseball when I was young.
I want to remember all of this.
I've told you not to call me Tom.
He looks tired.
I warned him of the danger.
A dog jumped onto the chair and lay motionless for five minutes.
We saw paramedics treating the gunshot victims.
Let's be honest with each other.
He was anxious to meet you.
I'll wait for you.
What is it this time?
They have plenty of water.
She will be back within a week.
The day we arrived was a holiday.
Did I miss something this morning?
We'll eat on the way.
I know who lives in this house.
We gave our word.
Tom is almost as old as Mary.
We intended to start right away.
Why don't you tell me about it?
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.

You ruined everything.
This is justified.
Would you mind if we left?
Please be polite.
Excuse me, but could you scoot over a little bit, please?
There must be some way we can help Tom.

Nature is scary.
I should've gone home.

Bad news travels fast.
Wait a bit.
I'm not done yet.
I'm sending you a birthday present by airmail.
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
"What time is it?" he wondered.
I'm smarter than you.
We'll get them to talk no matter what it takes.
He stretched out his arm for a magazine.
Life is not all fun.
Termites are destroying the houses.
It's time you went to the barber's.
When he saw her letter, he felt somewhat uneasy.
It rained three days on end.
A huge federal budget deficit has been plaguing the American economy for many years.
If you go by bus, you can get there in about one-third of the time.
I do want to open it.
That was very good.
She likes short skirts.
I didn't argue.
She is well known both in Japan and in America.
Is it your first day at school?
He sacrificed everything for you.
It all happened quickly.
I have to talk to you alone.
I thought I was cool.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
Let's ask Tom why he was late.
We need exercise.
We'll convince Tom.
This is good to know.
Tom could've done it by himself.
Call us.
Not many survive this disease.
The richer he became, the more he wanted.
Why would you do that without telling us?
My aunt lives in New York.
Don't waste your youth, otherwise you'll regret it later.
Where is he?
I'm not the least bit worried about losing my job.
One of you is lying.
All big cities have traffic problems.
The flame flickered for a moment, then died out.
You smashed it.
We respect Tom a lot.
I was miserable without you.
Our uncle bought us movie tickets.
Tom is working on it right now.
I care about all of you.
They're all nuts.
The children went out to play.
Nobody saw it coming.
It matters to me.
She scolded him for being late.
How old were you when you learned to write your name?
How do you tell each other apart?
He's not available.
What a clever dog!
Well, have you decided?
I quickly ate lunch.
I know I'm alone on this.
It was a church event.
I hate being alone on Valentine's Day.
Please tell me you're kidding.
What department do you work for?
I want to ask a favor of you.
I'd like to talk about Tom.
I know your roommate.
I'll try to persuade Tom to help.
You're embarrassing yourself.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have a Christmas vacation in Japan?
I cannot accept your present.
I have not understood anything.
I ate a hot dog for lunch.
I have something I want to tell you.
We don't need a visa to go to France.
Since you're tired, you should rest.
Say hello to your sister for me.
He cried out for help.
Is this wine?
I'm pleased with my new bathing suit.
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
I stayed at home all day instead of going to work.
Your car is fast.
Your efforts will bear fruit someday.
I like R & B.
Is your mother at home?
I want to move away.
Tom is a 33-year-old man.
It is going to be quite cold.
I am going on a picnic tomorrow.
Are you thinking of going to university?
What should I feed my dog?
You can trust him to keep his word.
They're not going to catch us.
She resides in New York.
You're free to go.
I really need to talk to you.
I'm forgetful.
Okay, I'm ready.
He's your typical workaholic.
I don't know my address yet, I'm going to stay with my friend for a while.
Can't you see a stapler somewhere around there?
Tom said to ask you.
You haven't eaten, have you?
I did everything I could to be your friend.
Tom can't play tennis.
We had fun, didn't we?
They let me go.
He is about my size.
They're Asian.
Does that mean yes?
I value your friendship very much.
I owe him some money.
Tom almost fainted.
I'll be back right away.
I'm no one special.
Giving up isn't the answer.
I don't know what you're complaining about.
We're all single.
We bought our new neighbors a clock as a housewarming gift.
Just about everyone came.
It's considered to be an important matter.
Could you help me out a little?
Tom is yelling at Mary.
I know you want to make me happy.
From a literary point of view, his work is a failure.
She died of typhoid fever.
Tom bought himself a new sports car.
Some superstitious people in America believe that if a black cat crosses your path, you'll have bad luck.
I knew who did it.
I think Tom is loyal.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I have nothing to say.
Tom made himself something to eat.
The classroom is full of teenagers. A couple of them are asleep.
You don't have to apologize.
I hope that my sister will pass the entrance examination.
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
You shouldn't always do what everyone else seems to be doing.
Where I live, we have snow in January.
A good password should be difficult to guess, but easy to remember.
That's just your imagination.
Tom is looking for someone who speaks French.
Is it large enough?
Despite adversity, the architect achieved worldwide fame.
He has a long nose.
I know him by name.
That boy showed no fear.
This is simply amazing.
This must be for you.
I'm very interested in the job.
Do you miss your kids?
He studies very hard.
My turn finally came.
I'll get it.
I can't believe I just shot myself.
We should be proud of ourselves.
He's doing his German homework.
It could be big trouble.
Main Street was blocked off all morning for the parade.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
What foods are you allergic to?
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
Loosen up.
You really want to do this, don't you?
You must stay.
If that's true, then she's better than me.
Are you the prophet?
You're funny.
You are welcome to do anything you like.
Cats catch mice.
I have fulfilled my promise.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
Are you still planning to quit your job?
Some of them were wounded.
She went to the hospital yesterday.
If you want one, you'll have to find your own.
He is not always in the office in the morning.
I will show you how to solve it.
She advised him to come back at once.
I want you to come work for me.
This one is as good as that one.
Riding double on a bicycle is dangerous.
Bring me the phone, Tom.
Who's your teacher?
Use it or lose it.
I need to get a haircut.
I'm not young anymore.
Is it all paid for?
Tom doesn't understand this.
He likes sweets.
We're not ready for this.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
I do not like the way he treats others.
I'm not a doctor, but a teacher.
You're not a child anymore.
I only found out about that today.
It is rather warm today.
The first season of the year is spring.
Let's try to make Tom laugh.
It was not unexpected.
Pour a little wine in my glass.
I'm too poor to marry her.
How many times have you been there?
Shut the door, please.
You said you were going to handle it.
Neither is true.
This website is very useful.
I think Tom is still alive.
He plays very well.
Your name was dropped from the list.
She went to the train station to see him off.
I took the liberty of calling him by his first name.
I have no idea why it is so.
You should have known better than to go out in the rain without an umbrella.
His proposal is completely out of the question.
Tom didn't leave a suicide note, so the police suspect murder.
I can't let you go.
His parents love me.
Why would you say that?
They come from the same town.
I will quit smoking for good.
We wish him all success in his future endeavor.
To my knowledge, she hasn't married yet.
Tom is back in his apartment.
We must water the flower.
I need you to leave now.
We make a good team.
I will get you a bicycle for your birthday.
Could you talk a little slower?
I really think you should stop doing that.
I really don't want to miss that.
He is an utter stranger to me.
Either he is wrong or I am.
He's not all there.
The dog was sleeping on the mat.
We have to find out what's going on here.
He was crushed to death.
I'm glad I invited you.
I wanted to know what would happen.
The funeral is tomorrow.
Can you check the tire pressure?
I didn't hear you.
This room doesn't get much sunshine.
I think I like eating white rice better than brown rice.
Mother is cooking in the kitchen.
I should be in charge.
We need to get going.
It wasn't a request.
Sentences begin with a capital letter.
Exhaust from factories pollutes the air.
I wasn't trying to hurt anybody.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
I forgot to do something.
I'm not a monster.
I hate this part of town.
All the students are studying English.
They walked upstairs.
Keep your eyes open.
It'll cost me my job.
I thought you would come.
We need you back in the office.
I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, we'd have been friends.
There is a cat under the desk.
She's very afraid of snakes.
They revolted against the government.
No one else could do my work.
God sent a sign.
We went to the beach together.
She was humiliated by him.
Stay sharp.
Did you have fun last night?
Let me know when you've finished.
It was very beautiful.
He doesn't know any better.
I am on holiday this week.
I wish he had gone on to university.
Do you know what I mean?
There's no way to tell.
Do you mean us?
I spent all day with my friend.
She is engaged to him.
It's a good system.
Further testing is needed.
I'm kidding.
Your driver's license has expired.
What did you hear?
I've forgotten my password.
This works.
Someone's coming.
I've never told anyone that before.
I did not take many photos.
Please spend a few minutes thinking about this.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Don't you like Chinese food?
I will stay home tomorrow.
This is what you must do.
She tried to persuade him not to decline the offer.
He has a beautiful tan.
We were destined to meet one day.
Juggling is another thing I'm not very good at.
What was her answer to your proposal?
Read it to me.
Have you decoded the message yet?
You can't blame me for that.
I apologize if I offended you.
They followed you here.
I can't help you do that.
Which floor do you live on?
He had just arrived.
I think that's already happened.
Your pulse is normal.
Who will take care of the baby?
You must do it at once.
I said nothing.
His son had been killed in a duel.
Tom is a friend of mine.
It's easy if you try.
I will get it for you.
The instant he opened the door, he smelt something burning.
I'm busy, so I can't go.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
It's a real honor to meet you.
We're always right.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
I guess I've been too busy.
Let's get out of the taxi.
Due to the fog, traffic is temporarily suspended.
I have two cousins.
I always get up at six.
I have enough money to buy it.
The Hermitage Museum is located in Saint Petersburg.
It's an old picture.
The ship set sail for Bombay.
I was nearly hit by a car.
They took a big risk.
Would you put out the candles?
Did you tell anybody?
My grandma has gotten very old.
I really want to see Tom today.
Tom and Mary finally decided to get divorced.
Everyone in the classroom was coughing.
I had a pleasant dream last night.
Where are you planning to stay?
He walked away with a sad look on his face.
How many plums are there?
What seems to be the problem here?
Do you have your plane ticket?
You're sleepy.
Put your hands in the air.
I was born in Tokyo on the eighth of January in 1950.
Have we met before?
Where did you find the key?
You may choose any of them.
Not all blondes are dumb.
You may go there.
You see that tall building over there, don't you?
I shouldn't be here.
I was caught in a shower.
She waited for him for hours.
You would be safe there.
Have you finished it?
I can't wait to die.
What does it feel like to be famous?
Tom and Mary can't both be right.
Do you mean what you say?
Tom didn't want anything.
I'm all out of tricks.
They want peace.
I'm at a loss for words.
Never choose a vocation just because it promises social standing.
This happens all the time.
Everyone thinks the same thing.
I will help.
I have something to tell you.
You'll want to look your best tomorrow.
We were all concerned.
She got her daughter a personal computer.
I wasn't drunk.
It will get warmer and warmer.
I don't think she is happy.
Are you in a bad mood or something?
What was served at the party?
Let's not beat around the bush.
She dressed herself quickly.
How did you lose it?
You should call your mother more often.
I suppose it's possible.
He is not interested in art at all.
He has curly hair.
Cover it up.
I'm offended.
Both of them seem suspicious.
I really owe you an apology.
Who knows more about you than your own mother?
The chickens were killed by a fox.
Who's here with you?
Tom gave me 300 dollars.
Science will not solve all of our problems.
I have a lot of friends.
I've never been able to talk to Tom.
You're not helping.
I can survive alone.
Had he heard the news, he might have been shocked.
Weddings are expensive.
Nothing is the matter with me.
They're part of us.
You've been suspended.
Stop squabbling.
Many people work in industrial towns.
She looked lonely.
You must be a good cook.
It is possible that he has had an accident.
Do you need much money?
These light bulbs can't all be bad.
Why do you want that anyway?
The mayor didn't like what the journalists wrote.
There they go again.
I asked him if he knew my name.
You don't seem too sure.
I have lost my pencil.
Prices went up.
I thought you'd be grateful.
Come on, grow up.
The boy has been sleeping for ten hours.
We gave our word.
Don't tell me what I already know.
I hate secrets.
They were dancing to the music.
I'll leave the rest to you.
I will hit the sack.
I can't go.
If you are not satisfied with your share, I'll make it a bit more attractive.
He said that he had seen the picture before.
Even the teacher could not solve the problem.
It took me three hours to write the letter.
It's too bad you can't come with us today.
Any input would be appreciated!
Tom wants to keep things the way they are.
I don't believe it was an accident.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Who're you looking for?
We should've bought three bottles of wine.
I don't have good luck, so I don't play pachinko or buy lottery tickets.
We were so tired that we turned in about 9:00 last night.
I've studied French, remember?
Having a full time job and raising two kids at the same time is hard.
I've brought you a little something.
Do you have any more of those?
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
Nobody was able to suggest a solution.
Tom is a very good friend.
I believe that.
I don't like your friends.
The weather was perfect yesterday.
They're staying.
Try some of this.
I'm not hurt.
Is anyone else excited?
She asked me a question.
The joke's on us.
She has been to Paris.
Let me try again.
Don't talk to me!
No one is immortal.
This is a Japanese doll.
Open the door and let me in, please.
What do you want now?
We think that he's honest.
They say that a large dam will be built.
How's your old lady doing?
Do you know when Tom will get back?
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
He can cook as well as his wife.
I want to ask you about the money you found.
Being very tired, I went to bed early.
She showed her courage in the face of danger.
I've got nothing to do today.
Children depend on their parents for food and clothing.
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?
He wiped the sweat from his forehead.
I have plenty of friends.
I don't like looking foolish.
A storm kept the ship from leaving Kobe.
That cut on your arm looks pretty serious.
I beg to differ with you.
I had to see someone on business.
I came to Tokyo three years ago and have been living here ever since.
Tom still thinks Mary likes him.
What is your blood type?
They're undamaged.
I received your letter the day before yesterday.
Tom was born there.
Don't you have anything better to do?
It didn't happen that way.
Staying at home is boring.
How could you not give me the message?
Tom didn't suspect a thing.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
It's time to go home.
I wash my car once a week.
Let me borrow that.
Don't think about stuff like that.
What they said to you is exactly the opposite of what they told me yesterday.
What are we all doing?
The surgeon took out his patient's appendix.
Are you still in love with your wife?
She stayed at a hotel.
I owe my success to him.
I'll handle this.
No one would offer him a job.
I want it all.
Could you fill me in?
I can't even remember my own name.
We hope to finish planting the field before the sun sets.
My dad bought me books.
Once bitten, twice shy.
I forgot to tell you why we're asking for donations.
That's really not funny.
Do you really want to put your money in that bank?
I have as many books as he does.
The baby needs his mother.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
That looks good.
A woman appeared from behind a tree.
We're waiting for the right time.
I want to see you in my office right now.
Don't let go. Hold on tight.
The leaves of the trees began to turn red.
Let go of my hair.
I bought a hybrid.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel better.
I'm three blocks away.
I didn't want to bug you.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Were you excited?
They talked on the phone every night.
I wish she had come last night.
It makes me nervous.
This plane is his.
Airplanes enable people to travel great distances rapidly.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
You don't need to wait.
He has been very busy this week.
Do you ever think about that guy?
My grandfather was a soldier during the war.
She has a good figure.
I didn't want to spend any more time alone.
Please hand this in at the front desk.
We can talk about it in the future.
I figured everybody knew that.
We should write a formal letter to the director.
Could you drop me off?
Write to Tom.
The police chased the stolen car.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
They couldn't help us.
We're still alive.
The guy who hit you is at the front door.
He's sitting in the waiting room.
Tom is really clever.
What was stolen?
They were walking along the street arm in arm.
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping.
How thick is the board?
I had a good time playing golf.
They are not enemies, but friends.
Tom converted about half of his yen into dollars and the other half into euros.
A boy came running toward me.
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake.
There are almost no books.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
They had no beards, no hair and no eyebrows.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
We're rich.
We must start at once.
I don't belong.
I have to do it again.
That's how I like things.
It's about time to go to school.
I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
The doctor continued to observe the patient's behavior.
I'm being promoted.
I failed the driving test.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
Tom wants to say hello.
I was told never to do that.
I walked around the block.
I can't make you any promises.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
My wife is a good manager.
You may speak to him.
She didn't know what to say to him.
I tried, but I did not succeed.
Turn right at the next intersection.
I like your personality.
I was raised right.
Try and do your homework by yourself.
Do you want to come out and play?
I like the beach.
Since my mother was sick, I stayed home from school.
When is he coming back?
Am I on the right track?
I saw my reflection in the window.
They could still be here.
I won't let you die.
I am very dangerous.
I received this electric knife as a gift.
Don't rip me off!
I'm all confused.
Why are you acting this way?
Tom is guilty.
My wife is a good manager.
He is my husband's best friend.
I'm not supposed to drink.
I wanted to be a piano teacher.
Have you ever been kissed?
I get up at six.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
Tell Tom to wait.
Would you like to switch seats?
I can hear nothing.
I know all the details.
I'm not bitter.
That song reminds me of my home.
I'm your friend.
Her anger was genuine.
Soldiers must carry out their orders.
I'm working as fast as I can.
It's impossible that he forgot our meeting.
I've got all the friends I need.
I usually don't bother with people like him.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
I feel lost without you.
The only thing that matters is whether or not you can do the job.
I'm not done with you yet.
I'm sorry my father is out.
It's a matter of life and death.
We'll have loads of fun.
The enemy attacked us at night.
The crew is busy preparing for the voyage into outer space.
You've been following me, haven't you?
That goes without saying.
I'm unlucky.
May I speak to you a minute?
He was aware of my presence but he did not greet me.
He was wounded in the shoulder.
Tom allowed Mary to leave early.
Frankly speaking, I hate him.
The tubes are clogged.
He was caught in an ambush.
I'm wet.
Looking into the room, I found nobody there.
I will come up with a solution to the problem.
I hope you two are very happy.
I think it's time for me to buy a new camera.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
All I want to do is finish what I started.
Those were the days.
Tom is used to staying up all night.
Did Tom talk to you about his plans for next weekend?
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Finally, I have my own car.
I run every morning.
Where is her family?
Do you think she's attractive?
They elected her to be the mayor.
I have a friend in England.
You should not despise a man just because he is poorly paid.
You should have told him.
You should do it.
There's no money.
I want exactly what you want.
I want you to be quiet.
Tom said he would buy it.
I'd rather stay home than go out in this weather.
Now I'm in trouble.
She was on verge of fainting.
Drunken driving is a serious problem.
You're not allowed in here.
If you need anything, just call.
What bothers me is his attitude.
I remember seeing her somewhere.
You're very skeptical.
I'm going to have to change my schedule.
Don't push me.
He sees nothing wrong with it.
I overslept yesterday.
I didn't shoot anyone.
I might be wrong.
Listen to this!
I can't dance either.
It's been a pleasure chatting with you.
I’m able to speak.
I have no memory of that.
Tom changes his mind a lot.
My driving instructor says that I need to be more patient.
I have no food.
I'm not a baby, you know!
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Which one is broken?
My mother looks young for her age.
Shall I continue?
Look behind you.
Toyota's new car sports a hefty price tag.
I think we've met before.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Are you new?
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
I need this more than you.
I am still attached to this bicycle.
She works for French intelligence.
Are you productive?
Doing homework is extremely boring.
They crossed the border into Spain.
We never got the chance.
We don't really know anything about death.
Does this backpack belong to him?
I'm not nervous.
I don't need to go to the doctor.
You'll ruin everything.
Have you got a match?
What are we doing for lunch?
The recent frequency of earthquakes makes us nervous.
I think we're finished here.
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one.
How does this disease spread?
Tom never came back.
Whatever you do, don't run.
She informed me of her departure.
Are we still on for later?
I love all of you.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
I didn't want to postpone our meeting.
Tom said he would try.
Lincoln was a good politician and a smart lawyer.
I can look at it when you're ready.
All I want is your cat.
She told us not to make a noise.
What're you doing about this?
I shouldn't have walked home late at night by myself.
Can you imagine the world without money?
I think Tom is sick.
I will never forgive you.
Tom is very efficient.
The problem is solved.
I don't know the reason why he went there.
The king oppressed his people.
How many days are there in a week?
Do you sell desk lamps here?
Beware of imitations.
We can't be killed.
Tom doesn't want anything to drink.
How did you get to know him?
The union was modest in its wage demands.
I'm your boss.
Did you read the article?
Tom shouldn't have told Mary.
It's frightening.
Personally, I don't think it makes any difference who wins the election.
You should know better than to talk back to your boss.
She translated that word for word.
I asked him if he would return soon.
I'll cook.
We're in trouble.
We lost no time in sending him to the hospital.
Tom opened the door and held it open for Mary.
I have a dog.
You're not allowed to eat those.
Tom doesn't seem to be aware of the problem.
I caught Tom.
The clock is defective.
He no longer lives here.
The money is gone.
I see your point.
I'm sorry, I don't really remember.
He's raking it in.
My grandfather died when I was boy.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
I can't help feeling something's wrong.
They're just for you.
I'm looking for my camera.
Tom doesn't know.
We are working in the interest of peace.
Can I have some more tea?
That's how it was.
What are you lining up for?
The mass is over.
Tom learned to dive when he was five.
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
You don't have to respond.
She approached him with a smile on her face.
They got the short end of the stick.
Tom likes to write poems and song lyrics.
I reconsidered your offer.
I want you out of here now.
I'd like to kiss you.
I heard every word.
I'm really tired today.
It appears that he is a musician.
I thought it over and decided not to go.
Tom lay awake for a long time thinking about what he should do.
Take this aspirin.
The cat caught a mouse.
Are you afraid of the dark?
My efforts produced no results.
I got hammered last night.
I think it's time for me to clean the chimney.
She's used to getting up early.
Japan is in eastern Asia.
You're very rude.
Are you registered?
Does that mean you'll stay?
Spring has come.
We both fell asleep.
Don't worry about me so much.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
I am ashamed about what happened yesterday.
They each received a present.
I'm done thinking.
He was almost drowned.
When did that happen?
When he came, I was writing a letter.
An electric current can generate magnetism.
He climbed the tree without difficulty.
Are you sleepy?
Do I look dead to you?
I know Tom knows something.
This is Room 839.
I was almost hit by a car.
Oh please!
The ambulance went out of control and came close to running over a pedestrian.
I want to want what you want.
What are you here for?
Stop being cruel.
What did they want?
This car has a good warranty.
I tested everything.
They camped on the beach.
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
We gave blood to help the child.
She couldn't convince him to buy her a new car.
I loved that.
I hate to wait.
Elephants can't ride bicycles.
There are no stupid questions.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Did I embarrass you?
I don't know what her name is.
I can come tomorrow.
This is personal.
Taste this wine to see if you like it.
He is studying history at the university.
I like it that way.
Old habits die hard.
Don't put sugar in my coffee.
I've heard a lot about you.
Do I have to spell this out for you?
You ruined everything.
I often have bad dreams.
Tom had to wait three hours.
I felt depressed.
Just let me walk away.
They lost everything.
I require your advice.
Do you still have feelings for him?
I don't want to waste time talking to Tom.
I came to give you this.
I realize that you guys wouldn't be here if you didn't have to be.
She was a charming woman.
I know Tom understands.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
Give us a ride downtown.
You didn't say that before.
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
I haven't seen you in ages.
You can't do both at the same time.
We're competitors, not partners.
He denied having taken part in the crime.
I love what I do.
Tom's funeral will be this weekend.
I made a big mistake.
He gets on my nerves.
Did you miss me?
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
This isn't a new car.
Since he was feeling sick, he stayed in bed.
I went there out of curiosity.
You start.
I've broken my glasses.
Many friends came to see me off.
See you all tomorrow.
He is much smarter than I am.
Don't get discouraged.
Thank you for calling.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
You might get something in the mail today.
I'm still your friend.
Why did you come over here?
Can you at least be happy for me?
She is watering the flowers.
It was a mistake to refuse his assistance.
We need to do this right.
Can you pay me in advance?
I went, too.
Why are you in such a hurry?
I don't want to overreact.
What did she mean?
The spoken word matters.
I don't know if we want to do that.
You're very forward.
She drives me crazy.
I feel like dancing.
She looked for her children, but couldn't find them anywhere.
You can't rely on him these days to do a proper job.
I asked him not to play the piano late at night.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
I lost my phone.
Don't you just hate this kind of movie?
I really like this restaurant.
How do you want me to handle that?
Wake me up at seven.
You're killing me.
Please turn off your engine.
He is still full of energy.
He decided to study harder.
That was wrong, of course.
I need some water.
Perhaps we will see each other again tonight.
They went whale watching.
I felt the sweat trickle down my brow.
You don't fool me, you know.
I got arrested.
I want to know how you know that.
I'm not particularly worried.
You can stay in the extra bedroom if you want.
It's pretty hot.
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
Tom noticed Mary wasn't wearing the ring he'd given her.
I thought you were in charge.
He came to meet me yesterday afternoon.
Tom kept talking and didn't let Mary get a word in edgewise.
It looks so real.
We're working as fast as we can.
If I knew his address, I would write to him.
When will you get through with work?
I thought you'd be more helpful.
I want something to eat.
I met him then for the first time.
Many people in Africa were killed as a result of the storm.
These gloves kept her hands warm.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
I'm not late, am I?
Tom may come and visit me any time he wants to.
I think it's funny.
I didn't see her.
Does this actually make you happy?
You're a jolly good feller.
They awarded her first prize at the flower show.
I've just finished breakfast.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
Ireland and England are separated by the sea.
This is hilarious.
Do you really want to talk about that now?
Be polite to everyone.
Don't forget to put on some sunscreen.
What would you like me to do?
The house collapsed a week later.
Where can I catch the bus for Obihiro?
Look out! There's a truck coming!
These socks do not match.
What is the name of that bird?
Get us out of here.
I chose last time. You choose this time.
He came after you left.
You're completely delusional.
A heavy snow fell in Kyoto for the first time in ages.
The home team won.
I want a dozen cream puffs.
Are you ready to begin?
I also love to cook.
Tom claims he can accurately predict the future.
I want to buy them all.
I think I touched a nerve.
That's all I was thinking.
Does this thing actually work?
All of my relatives are taller than me.
Why did you use up all the money?
I just don't understand you.
Where is the bathroom?
You may sit.
The mother of that child is an announcer.
You're not responsible for what happened.
Tom is drunk.
A French translation of this book was published in 2013.
Tom works with Mary.
He was experienced in business.
You're the oldest.
There's no denying the harmful effects of smoking.
I will behave.
It stinks.
This made me very sad.
Do you eat a lot?
That's a good idea!
What did I just say?
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
He looks nothing like a doctor.
I've left my charger at home.
My mother didn't mention it.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
Are all of these people your friends?
Don't be so choosy.
He got engaged to my cousin.
I don't know anything about what happened.
You're afraid, aren't you?
Tom plays golf every weekend.
I wasn't competitive enough.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
You may bring your own lunch to school.
Be sure to drop me a line.
Tom bolted the door.
Would you do me a favor?
That's quite meaningless.
The young people are fed up with the politics of this country.
Tom retired when he was 65.
My whole body was one big bruise after the rugby game.
In this course, we'll spend time helping you sound more like a native speaker.
Did you come here alone?
The snow has begun melting.
What would you like to eat?
I suppose you've got a point.
I'm very tired.
She went shopping with him last Monday.
The leaves on the tree have turned red.
The girls are going to be late this evening.
A team is only as strong as its weakest member.
Are you picking on me?
I paid my bills.
Some people like sports, and others don't.
Tom has some nosy neighbors.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
Is this your pen?
Stop stalling and do what I told you.
Here I am again.
Do you like to travel?
Tom filled out the application for me.
You don't have to go.
She adores her older brother.
I don't really need your help.
I think I would have heard gunshots if there had been any.
I know every word on this page.
They found us.
Adding comments makes the code easier to read.
Well, let's talk turkey.
I have a grenade.
Tell me how I can help you.
I speak a little German.
Having failed twice yesterday, he doesn't want to try again.
What would you do, if you lost your job?
They have families.
She plays Bach.
Polish girls didn't want Justin Bieber to come to Poland.
Things are getting out of hand.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
I don't like your friends.
What do you really mean?
Just relax a moment.
Did I tell you that?
Tom deserves a better life.
Tom will never make it.
It is likely to rain today.
He looks like a bug.
Tom can't work this evening.
Don't exceed the speed limit.
Give it to me, please.
I will go if you go.
I have to confess to you that I snore.
We've been talking about you.
It may be that he likes his job.
It's a song.
I found him lying on the bed.
The boy did nothing but cry all day long.
He entered the room.
Playing the piano is her favorite pastime.
Let him go!
When can you start?
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
The boy told me why he was crying.
We will take care of this for you.
Your wristwatch is on the table.
Yesterday, I put honey in my tea.
If I were caught, do you know what would happen?
Get out of the classroom.
I am not in the least afraid of dogs.
I am surprised that your family has a Japanese car.
I have to go to the bank this morning.
They hunted foxes.
Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything.
Did you hear that?
She advised him to stop working so much.
I wanted to tell you.
I like this neighborhood.
What time does it open?
As you like.
What time do you go home?
She couldn't convince him to accept the bribe.
You do like living dangerously.
I heard it from a reliable source.
We have time to spare.
I begin this afternoon.
I think we'd better be going.
Is anyone hurt?
Get back to the ship.
He disappeared into the crowd.
She is the one you should model yourself after.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
I could hear everything the president said.
I could use a little sleep.
Was this somebody else's idea?

I have no intention of telling you the result.
How could you say such a thing?
I won't fail this time.
He has three older sisters.
He kept badgering her until she told him what he wanted to know.
He won't make it.
It's possible, but not probable.
We need to advertise on television.
Don't forget the ticket.
Pretend you're me.
I am not wholly convinced that you are right.
I think we should stick to the original plan.
I don't like it when you swear.
You're very pretty.
Last year, I couldn't spend as much time with my children as I wanted to.
Did you go out?
Stop playing hard to get.
I'd like you to cut my hair.
You're very observant.
Where do you think I met her?
Would you like to leave a message?
The old man stopped suddenly and looked back.
He thinks I'm jealous.
I hope you're hungry.
The two gunshot victims are in the intensive care unit at a nearby hospital.
A nuclear war will bring about the destruction of mankind.
It's time to eat.
I really like garlic.
I can't explain it to you now.
We met today.
This is highly irregular.
He was shot 3 times in the arm.
I felt left out.
We walked along the beach.
We often eat raw fish.
They were not impressed.
What person does everyone take off his hat to?
Am I talented?
We've all done things we're not proud of.
Get him off my hands.
Do what you have to do.
Are we alone in the universe?
He's incredibly stupid.
I'll be careful with the kids.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
When are you going to move?
I will be busy next week.
I waited a while.
How did you make it?
Your watch is on the desk.
I want to see what I'm up against.
People say that life is short.
Goodbye!
I forgot about that.
Tom knows how to cook spaghetti.
You're not dead.
She never stops complaining.
He pushed the cat into the swimming pool.
Could you give me a little help?
I was careless.
After we walked for a while, we got to the lake.
I feel sorry for him.
I'm already bored.
Hope you had a good birthday.
I'm the boss around here.
He said, "I want to be a doctor."
That's all I need to know.
Tom doesn't want to wait any longer.
This place is large, isn't it?
I was young and crazy once.
Throw it there.
She took a job in a store for the summer.
I'm retired.
Would you care for a little wine?
I warned you once.
Finish your drink.
Who are you supposed to be?
I couldn't breathe.
This is the pen that he signed the document with.
I don't have any evidence.
You're unbelievably stupid.
It won't hurt.
He gave the barking dog a vicious kick.
I can't do this by myself.
They want us to come in right away.
She advised him to walk instead of taking a bus.
"When do you get up?" "I get up at eight."
I don't talk to him anymore.
Turn the radio down a little.
That experience left a bad taste in my mouth.
I was just leaving home then.
I want a puppy.
The murder charge was reduced to manslaughter.
It took me two hours to memorize this sentence.
I've finished eating.
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
How dare you speak to me like that?
I don't know what it is.
Are you saying that you don't want to see me anymore?
We couldn't do that.
We actually saw the accident.
Where was your daughter?
You'll feel better in a few hours.
Can foreign students be in the club?
He has been secretly in love with her.
He walked along the street.
He will make you eat dirt.
I hear you're moving out.
Don't worry. I can fix it.
They carried water in buckets.
We depend on you.
Is the horse black?
We left Boston at 2:30 yesterday.
I ought to go.
Help me lift the package.
Did he do such things?
I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.
Tom can make anybody laugh.
I wish you'd never been born.
Tom's healthy.
How embarrassing!
I just wanted to talk to you.
These things aren't mine!
Do you have your passport?
How often do you see him?
I just want to find a cab.
Could you speak a little louder please?
The museum is open from Monday to Friday.
Doctors thought he had a cold.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Who will be elected chairman?
You disappointed me.
They admired the fine view from the hill.
It's not that cold.
You're very stylish.
Tom plays tennis.
My parents are in Australia.
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?
He did a real snow job on my daughter.
A rose has thorns on its stem.
Do tigers purr?
He was disappointed.
This is too hard.
Unfortunately, it's not possible.
Why don't we go swimming?
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
You're the one who trained me.
I'm going to join a demonstration.
Darwin changed the world.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
Did you see anyone suspicious?
I need more gold.
He holds the rank of colonel.
Thank you for your trouble.
He decided not to go.
I really wish I didn't have to go to that meeting this afternoon.
You stay here.
Tom speaks French, and so does Mary.
It is two miles from here to the park.
Language changes as human beings do.
She followed him home; then killed him.
That's all I did.
Let's talk about Australia.
How long do you plan on staying here?
Turn on the air conditioner.
Don't you see what's happened?
You should follow your teacher's advice.
He got what he wanted.
They've suffered enough.
We did not help him, so he made it by himself.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
He is something of a celebrity.
I got you all right where I want you.
That sounds really interesting.
I can't stand to see animals be teased.
My father may be sleeping.
It is too hot.
He's down to earth.
I don't know what's happened.
They love this song.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
I asked him what his name was.
No one can help you, Tom.
I think he is a doctor.
You have to be over 18 to drive.
Do you know a good dentist?
Are you still married?
I'll do it with you.
Carelessness often results in accidents.
A lot of wild animals died because there wasn't any food.
Students stand up when their teacher enters.
Tom hung up his coat.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
There was an old clunker parked just behind my new sports car.
Does anyone want some more pie?
Tom says he has an announcement to make.
He gave an explanation about why he had been absent.
She looks like a teacher.
They tried to discourage him from going.
Beats me.
I lost my way in the forest.
I need change for the bus.
I'll be very discreet.
Just stay away from my daughter.
The chances are slim to none that you'll win the lottery.
You may go anywhere.
That is all that he said.
Tom told them not to do that.
The wind blew all day.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
Judging from the look of the sky, it will be fine tomorrow.
Hello, how's business?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Was I polite enough?
Unless you hurry, you will be late for school.
The whole family was out harvesting the corn.
Here's the address.
You really must stop smoking.
You should keep your promises.
Do you live in the city?
I advised him not to spend all his money on food.
The German domination didn’t last very long.
I don't think this is the best time to talk to Tom.
This dress fits me perfectly.
How does he do it?
Were you out last night?
Why didn't they say something?
What do you need exactly?
Strive to be happy.
I'm going to my grandmother's.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
Tom comes here nearly every day.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I want to follow you wherever you're going.
I'll be thinking of you every day while I'm away.
I get motion sickness.
I started to cry.
That's what people say.
I think you'd better give up.
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
While traveling in Europe, I was pickpocketed on a train.
It's out of the question!
It is cold there, even in summer.
I feel very chilly.
Do you understand her?
Why do you want to go out with me?
Never give up on your dreams.
We're really married.
What will you do when you grow up?
She's fashionable.
I'm hearing that a lot lately.
Were you listening to the radio yesterday?
I don't have my purse.
What happened exactly?
He will have been working for five hours by noon.
You can buy whichever you like, but not both.
The house has been sold.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I bought this book for myself, not for my wife.
I don't even want to know.
How about a cup of coffee?
She advised him to cut down on smoking.
I thought that Tom was kind.
Who do you think I am?
She lives in this house by herself.
How much do you want?
You don't seem so busy.
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
Can you supply me with all I need?
We have plenty of time tonight.
I must refuse.
Can you show me where I am on this map?
I've got to speak to you.
I think Tom wants our help.
Will you wait for me?
We talked.
How many do you have in stock?
He said that it was nine o'clock.
Shape up or ship out!
He could not hold back his tears.
I just have to do something.
I'll do it now.
I'm not scared of dying.
I don't need your help.
I heard a knock at the door.
Be more flexible.
The man finally confessed.
You can call me this afternoon if you want.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.
He had fun with it.
You're very intelligent.
This store sells old books.
Have you eaten anywhere interesting lately?
I want a lot.
I don't think I can do anything else.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I'm by your side.
Come here quickly.
I don't know where to start.
And what happened after that?
Meat should not be eaten raw.
You think of everything.
You can't trust Tom.
Go and see the doctor.
I thought I recognized you.
I wasn't able to believe him at first.
Compare your translation with his.
I objected to his paying the bill.
The library will issue you a library card.
Did you do something new with your hair?
Would you like that?
Tom needed more time to finish his work.
I'll keep my eyes shut.
It was last year.
Who is the girl in the pink dress?
I am in agreement with most of what he says.
I thanked him from the bottom of my heart.
Don't eat too much.
How do you make your money?
I was born the year the war ended.
Are you in favor of the new law?
Water is liquid. When it freezes, it becomes solid.
Can I have your telephone number?
I don't want to see it.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
I'll get you.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
He has been waiting for an hour.
Do you enjoy living like this?
Do you know any good places to eat around here?
Please bring a cup of tea to me.
I feel protected.
I have come to kill you.
My father works for a bank.
I can't go back without you.
You're overemotional.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
It's easy for him to make friends.
I gave you my word.
We have no money.
I've been trying to get your attention.
I thought I recognized you.
Should I reply?
It was nothing less than a miracle.
I wanted to rent a bus.
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday.
He worked very hard.
I thought you were hungry.
The fact that they came here is undeniable.
I wish I had eaten breakfast.
Can you tell me what Tom said?
Tom lost.
I have a lot of old books. A couple of them are quite valuable.
I'm tidy.
He adopted the orphan.
Will you still be here when I get back?
The government must make fundamental changes.
Any clever boy can do it.
You should not give up hope.
Take a number.
What's the nearest planet to the sun?
I'm certain.
I like neither of them.
I saw him crossing the road.
He wasn't even there.
My dog is wagging his tail.
How about a smoke?
He was the last person to arrive.
I live and work in France.
We bought new furniture.
I can't believe it's true.
I hate exercising.
Speak more slowly, please!
I made him open the door.
Do you believe in the power of love?
Will the weather be good tomorrow?
Here, look at this.
I've been very busy lately.
I suddenly became dizzy.
Tom tossed the ball to Mary.
No student was able to answer the question.
I met her at the station by accident.
Do you want help with that?
The negotiations failed.
You're the only one I trust.
Most Hollywood movies have a happy ending.
Why don't you wear summer clothes?
I am looking forward to seeing you again soon.
Are you getting much out of that book?
He slipped on the ice.
We are out of danger.
No sooner had I left the house than it started to rain.
Can you leave me alone?
After a while, corn flakes in milk will become soggy.
Tom is in his room studying French.
This is a misunderstanding.
That was really difficult.
Why did you let Tom go?
It's just a stone's throw away.
Which way is the beach?
He was scared you would shoot him.
She emerged victorious in the struggle.
Camping is impossible where there is no water.
They held hands.
He is too drunk to drive home.
Put the book where you found it.
I figured that might be the case.
I can't say I'm terribly proud of what I did.
I don't know what could have happened to it.
That applies to him too.
You ought to love your neighbors.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
You're turning thirty.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
For a long time, I used to believe the same thing you do.
I can't just kick Tom out.
Let's continue the game after lunch.
Don't ask me.
She made fun of her husband.
What took you so long?
He went there by himself.
I don't really understand it.
What do you say you join me for dinner?
You're in better shape than I am.
I go to the park.
I'd like a receipt, please.
Let's play some video games to kill time.
I'm unenthusiastic.
I know you're in love with me.
Could I see your driver's license?
He is writing a letter to his parents now.
Call a plumber.
I don't like this tie. Show me another one.
Do you want to go to a soccer game?
Are you blushing?
I think it's time for me to get a bit of exercise.
The expedition has postponed its departure to the Antarctic.
Where did you get all these?
I like to be here.
The house is vacant.
He likes oranges.
Did you enjoy yourself?
Tom saw something on the ground.
What are you doing today?
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
It's still snowing in Boston.
Did it make you angry?
Can you afford it?
Please do it this way.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Speaking English is difficult.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I slapped his face.
It is not going to rain this evening.
This is nonsense.
When we arrived, the crowd had faded away.
I think we've got it figured out now.
I told her what he was doing in her room.
Don't be so modest.
Are you looking for someone?
He kept on singing.
I want to travel by airplane.
I wonder if there's any connection.
Did you enjoy going to exhibits in Romania?
My computer has got to be useful for something.
It looks like the dog wants something to eat.
They live nearby.
Due to the reason that I described above, I arrived at a different decision.
That's nice to know.
It's up to you to decide whether or not to go.
He not only speaks French, but he speaks Spanish, too.
I'm sorry if I offended anyone.
Are you surprised?
The road was obstructed by fallen trees.
We've made too many bad decisions.
A gang of thieves broke into the bank.
I have a poor imagination.
You should apologize.
Children want to hear the same story over and over again.
I really feel like crying right now.
We're all being manipulated.
I just came from there.
She was doing the washing then.
The children caught butterflies.
They received a box of books.
I still can't believe we won.
It looks like we're going to be staying here tonight.
Do you weigh more than Tom?
No one's gambling.
Do you want a ride?
Tom was better.
You may be right, but we have a slightly different opinion.
I tried it.
Police arrested one man.
He will go to the meeting instead of me.
I don't play games.
Since the bus was late, I took a taxi.
Is it too big?
That's really stupid.
Are you still planning to quit your job?
Tom seems to be in love.
Can you teach me how to ride a horse?
This is the house where I was born.
We must withdraw.
This is how I feel.
It's not always possible to eat well when you are traveling in this part of the world.
I wear a suit, but not a tie.
Promise me you'll be careful.
I don't know what that word means.
If you invite him, he may come.
They just taught me to swear.
You say I should know him quite well, but as a matter of fact, I was introduced to him only last week.
She advised him not to go out by himself at night.
Dogs bark.
Don't you want to meet Tom?
If you were in my place, what would you do?
I saw them.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Drinks are on me.
The media blew the whole thing out of proportion.
I know somebody who can help us.
We've talked it over among ourselves.
I don't know which of you is older.
Give my regards to your aunt and uncle.
He did it for the money.
They carried water in buckets.
Tom has done something wrong.
The door doesn't lock.
I worry about my future.
He would not give it up without a struggle.
We discussed the problem far into the night.
I'll be your teacher.
I don't have to answer your questions.
I have done it before.
Please hurry up!
Tom challenged Mary to a game of chess.
Stop fooling around!
I promised no such thing.
What is missing?
I think we can do that.
The roast lamb is very good.
Carbon dating was performed on the sample to determine its age.
Why are you so interested in him?
You're very timid.
I love the beaches in Australia.
Tom said he was ill, which was a lie.
I wasn't informed of this.
Tom said Mary would come.
Each of them has to write a report about what he saw.
You might as well throw your money away as spend it on gambling.
Why don't you ask him directly?
This man is incompetent.
My mother has a driver's license, but she doesn't drive.
Don't you read the tabloids?
She shot him.
Actually, you're right.
You don't have to get up so early.
I hope that she will help me.
She left her ticket at home.
I need to lose some weight.
I think you misunderstood what I said.
I have been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
She threatened to set our house on fire.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
Take Tom outside.
We're moving.
I've been gone for a long time.
I found the diary that my father kept for 30 years.
You must have women throwing themselves at you all the time.
I don't spend much time studying French.
When my wife's friend comes to visit, I find it hard to get a word in edgeways.
The baby has been crying for almost ten minutes.
I remember it vividly.
What happened to all our money?
I'm fairly happy.
Do you have any idea who would do this?
By the way, where do you live?
You had better not tell your father about the accident.
They agreed to meet me here.
You understand this, don't you?
You didn't want me to starve, did you?
No one takes us seriously.
He belittles others to make himself feel important.
I want to show you something in the office.
What did you do then?
I'm ashamed of my past.
He can help you out.
They wanted to know what happened.
I don't see why not.
She is busy learning English.
We have two daughters and one son.
I think you should sit down.
Put it on my account.
The chair is close to the door.
Find somebody else.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
I don't like you either.
As far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the plan.
She also likes chocolate.
My plan was rejected.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
I hear you were grounded.
She greeted us with a smile.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I've forgotten your address.
He's working at his English.
Is this your money?
How's Tom?
Tom is quite different.
It wouldn't be the same without you.
He acted in his own interest.
Are you still there?
I hope we can still be friends.
I had an operation last summer.
That boy is really shy.
They're out of town.
Tom hasn't realized his mistake yet.
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
Tom caught Mary stealing his money from the cash register.
She's under the chair.
We criticized her for her behavior.
We met at summer camp.
Almost everybody was invited.
You should be more careful.
You need to be here for your family.
All of a sudden, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach.
She advised him to come back at once.
I don't want to read anything.
I'm getting undressed.
He hit the ball with his racket.
Tom doesn't work here anymore.
You have a sense of humor.
I mistook you for your brother.
They made a list of the names.
We must evacuate.
You're not listening to me.
I came near being drowned, trying to rescue a boy.
I can't believe no one heard that.
English is not my mother tongue.
You would be safe there.
It was here that I saw her.
I don't usually eat red meat.
This won't be easy.
I designed it.
Maybe I should go with you.
How many were wounded?
Are you good at tennis?
I'll call you after lunch.
I once knew a girl that snorted every time she laughed.
I'm 24 years old.
This made me very sad.
The young girl lost her bracelet.
Most of them just don't care.
He was called away on business.
I know what they said.
Show me the photos, please.
Whatever you do, don't ever press this button.
This is the house where I was born.
I think they're lying.
The troops had plenty of arms.
He stuck to his promise.
If that accident had happened in a city, it would have caused a disaster.
She put the children to bed.
Don't fix it if it ain't broke.
He accepted my idea.
How did you know one was missing?
We should do everything ourselves.
Be careful not to say anything stupid.
I want to sleep.
Do you mind if I ask you a question?
Could you solve the problem?
Guess what I ate for dinner last night.
Take this table away.
No one was in the car.
Don't carry more money than you need.
I don't feel like talking.
This book will be very useful to us.
I have one child.
You're conscientious.
I prefer to not talk about it.
I have no beef with him.
I'm beginning to think that I shouldn't have enlisted in the army.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
They called for an end to the fighting.
I'd like to read some books about the Beatles.
Are you free for dinner tonight?
Let's shake hands and be friends.
All the songs I sang for you today were written by me.
My instinct was right.
I accepted that a long time ago.
I think there's something wrong with you.
I explained the accident to him.
My camera is broken.
They arrived too soon.
It's very kind of you to say so.
When is your birthday?
Should I close?
You'll get there by three o'clock.
I'd like to go with you.
You're not normal.
A horse passed my house.
You have only to answer the first question.
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
I really miss you all.
I should've married your sister instead of you.
The car crashed into the truck.
I usually go to bed before ten.
Don't remind me.
She laughed at the sight of his hat.
They're not alone.
I doubt that's what really happened.
What is at issue in this debate is the survival of our planet.
Please freeze the fish and meat.
My best friend is currently in Rome.
I love what I'm doing right now.
Getting people to change is extremely difficult.
Do you have one?
He broke the rules.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Traffic was blocked by a landslide.
All of my friends got asked to dance except me.
He had gray hair.
Tom will be here tonight.
I don't want your business.
Don't talk back to me like that.
I've never been to New York, and my sister hasn't, either.
I took your name off the list.
He is twice as old as she is.
What is going on here?
They seem to have had a good time in Rome.
Are you ready now?
Get that thing off of me.
This house has eleven rooms.
Cats don't like water.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
I really don't want to go back to jail.
I'm not ashamed of what I did.
Play outside instead of watching TV.
About how many English words do you know?
You don't have the time.
Tom has some food allergies, so he has to be careful about what he eats.
You really annoy me.
Professional translators quite often specialize in just one field, for example law or medicine.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to drive.
The party was a flop.
I'm on a really tight schedule this week.
His mother speaks Italian.
Where were you coming from?
Did they go to museum by bus?
Americans have to spend hours figuring out their taxes.
They're angry.
He is suffering from loss of memory.
Her nails are red.
He lives near the beach.
Tom is in bed.
Are you sure you're not tired?
They were not pleased.
Don't forget to turn off the gas before going out.
I don't like homework.
He has a strong personality.
He is unmarried.
Best wishes from all of us.
Don't get on the train yet.
I just want people to like me.
He's washing your car.
He made the children laugh.
I regret to say I cannot come.
The Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in 1957.
I've forgotten your number.
We know enough.
I've rented a room in Paris for a month.
Tom almost caught Mary.
Why didn't she come?
This won't be the last time.
Our company is planning to build a new chemical plant in Russia.
Tell me what you see.
Everyone mistakes me for my brother.
I'll take him.
Everything went as planned.
Tom and Mary will come at 2:30.
Why did you buy it?
That can't be good for anybody.
He can run faster than me.
I'm not the only one who got here early.
He dozed off in history class.
We can't live another day without water.
She ordered a cup of tea.
You're not even paying attention.
I was disappointed by the news.
This makes no sense.
If he had worked harder, he could have succeeded.
Leave it to me.
Preserves must be stored in a jar with an airtight seal.
I've never seen my cat act like that.
He wants to get rid of the ants.
All the cherry trees in the park are in full bloom.
It was quite funny.
I never imagined anything like this.
Let's play house.
None of them said anything.
How many hot dogs have you sold today?
I have no words to express my gratitude.
He is considered the prime suspect by the police.
The tines of the fork are bent.
He wanted to know more about the trees, too.
The conference was not a complete success.
We tried to get him to change his mind, but couldn't.
You're not too late.
She is endowed with a special talent.
She couldn't afford it.
Dinner is probably ready by now.
She's six years older than me.
I don't know. Let me check.
Come on, let's try it.
Thank you very much for your help.
Do you speak Bulgarian?
You're a total wreck.
They've done it before.
Don't make me do it.
Shall we go?
The cherry blossoms are at their best in April.
Bring it to me.
Everything has a price.
I forgot I was supposed to bring a bottle of wine.
Don't tell me any more lies.
Which skirt do you like?
Can I sit with you?
I had already heard that song once.
He is generous to his friends.
We like him.
The city was full of hungry soldiers.
We'll come to look for you.
She wants to meet him again.
What are you looking at?
My internet connection is slow.
That pleases me very much.
Thanks anyway.
Do you want to get us both killed?
Who built it?
Do you have a Twitter account?
I was just about to go out when the phone rang.
I didn't see anyone using it.
Flour is made into bread.
They're right behind me.
Tom is always watching television.
I leave that to you.
He is nothing more than a coward.
Can you please tell me where the nearest public telephone is?
That would be wrong.
I am a bit drunk.
How are you connected?
Tom is the tallest in his class.
You're resourceful.
He succeeded in solving the problem.
Don't worry about it.
Whose idea was it to pitch the tent here?
We've got enough.
I didn't realize you were awake.
What do you know about all this?
I don't care who's coming.
Does he go to school by bus?
Just ignore it.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Did you buy this book?
I went shopping with a friend.
I'm lazy.
They never drink beer.
Don't forget to vote.
Is it a yes or a no?
I'm not ignoring you.
My sister, wearing her favorite red coat, went out today.
He was brave.
Are you happy right now?
The old man in front of us is ninety-two years old.
Dutch is closely related to German.
I don't have the answer.
I have something important to tell you.
What is this thing for?
What is it that you want?
I know who that is now.
We had a lot of rain last month.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
Try to calm down.
He felt a pain in his back.
The statue of Hachiko, the faithful dog, stands in front of Shibuya Station.
Try to find it.
They were caught red-handed.
Have you seen my new car?
That was really difficult.
She is the editor-in-chief.
Her behavior was appropriate to the occasion.
I would never let you down.
Roll down the window.
I'd be much obliged if you could give me a lift into town.
I'll have to think about it.
He lives in Morocco.
Tom, can you hear me?
I'll work.
He is in the bathroom.
I've finally gotten over my cold.
The apples are not quite ripe.
Please tell me your name and telephone number.
Tom is preparing dinner.
Tom wants to buy a new car.
You're the most beautiful woman in the world.
I've always loved you.
You look like you don't want to be here.
How did they manage that?
She bought him some candy.
Do you have any aspirin?
You are so childish sometimes.
Don't touch my camera.
Do you take me for a fool?
That's not very romantic.
I've never seen him wearing jeans.
I speak French.
Stop shooting.
How do you know where to go?
The plane will take off at five.
I want to do this.
How long has it been since you gave up teaching at that school?
I exchanged stamps with him.
I regret that I told you.
She always wears fashionable clothes.
They'll try again.
He's really selfish.
I love you like a son.
She can tell the most outrageous lie without batting an eye.
That is insane. Only a fool would believe that.
She couldn't convince him to write a song for her.
Don't ask me to do that.
I suggest keeping your opinions to yourself from now on.
You must start immediately.
I'm trying to talk to you.
I've given this a great deal of thought.
You're all set.
Has anybody here been to Hawaii?
Thank you very much.
I want to be a teacher.
You're forgiven.
I liked walking alone on the deserted beach.
I'm horrible with kids.
The plane had already taken off when I reached the airport.
Tom isn't really a teacher.
I want you to get a good night's rest.
You've got my sunglasses and I want them back.
You must pay attention to his advice.
We'd better leave her alone.
I go as often as I can.
There is a fundamental difference between your opinion and mine.
Tom thinks I'm stupid.
Tom just told his wife that he was leaving her.
You don't need luck.
Mary is now studying in her room.
It's up to you and me.
It's a bit cold, but it probably isn't worth putting the heater on yet.
Is that all we need?
I haven't completely given up the idea.
We're in a recession.
It's hard to keep up with his dirty deeds.
You're very sophisticated.
I'm too tired to concentrate on this problem right now.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone on a park bench.
They are aware of the difficulties.
Am I under suspicion?
Give her a doll.
Are these the only ones you have?
Tom's dead.
More than a third of the world population lives near a coast.
He made no reply.
She went for a walk with him this morning.
Do you like my new haircut?
Did I say you could talk?
Tom wanted to go home early.
You're alone, aren't you?
I do it all the time.
The two towns are separated by a river.
We need to be prepared.
We arrived there before noon.
I'm looking for the manager.
He will travel abroad next year.
Am I under investigation now?
I can't lend you this book.
I thought you'd want to help me.
I don't feel so smart.
I ate with my parents.
She did it for her children.
What's your favorite item of clothing?
Sit down and shut up.
I cleared my throat, but no words came.
Easter is near at hand.
I believe that he comes here.
I don't know when he'll be here.
We hardly ever talk to each other anymore.
I feel a lot better today.
At last, they ceased working.
I'm not like that anymore.
He is madly in love with that girl.
I have something that I want to say to him.
I have never heard him complain.
Do you drink wine?
I want you to go upstairs.
Everybody, get out of my house.
You really want to do this, don't you?
He was angry with himself.
Tom doesn't want an iPad. He wants a portable device that supports Flash.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
He cussed me out for having lied to him.
Your cough worries me.
What time did you close the store last night?
He painted the door over white.
I'm only a customer.
Tom was dressed all in black.
What did it turn out to be?
I wonder where he is now.
Elephants in Thailand are as common as kangaroos in Australia.
That sounds horrible.
I'm glad you brought this up.
You'd better come see this.
They did not listen.
I don't have any money.
You ought to have been more careful.
We used to talk about our future.
Don't enter the room until I say "All right."
You need to stop doing that right now.
What're you all dressed up for?
He is an evil man.
The website is down.
They come from the same village.
I just want a little more time.
Do you get it?
Do you have health insurance?
Having a telephone helped her find more clients.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
This conversation never happened.
She wants to be a designer.
How can I make him stop?
Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish.
This is my city now.
What time do you get up every morning?
All the villagers went out into the hills to look for a missing cat.
He fetched some water from the well.
Tom can be very charming.
In case anything happens, call me immediately.
The dog is dead.
Anything could happen.
What are these charges for?
Can you handle it?
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
You may give this picture to whoever wants it.
We're serious.
Don't try this at home.
Turn off the light and go to sleep.
I did not know this.
He is above suspicion.
I'm not sure I'm ready.
We can't fail.
I need to get something to eat.
What do you like to do in your free time?
It was really funny.
The result was rather disappointing.
I'm looking for my keys. Have you seen them?
That might not be necessary.
I see they've put you to work.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
You're not as smart as me.
The loud drill gave her husband a headache.
I can't believe I kissed you.
I have been writing letters all day long.
I have decided to learn shorthand.
Tom and Mary are playing tennis.
I was very reluctant.
There are wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot perceive.
Tom is slowly catching up with the rest of the class.
She kissed away the boy's tears.
The neighbor's dog was barking all night.
I was eventually released.
I hid myself under the bed.
I think we should run.
He is blind in one eye.
I want to apologize to you for calling you a jerk in front of your girlfriend.
Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
She made it plain that she wanted to marry him.
The last train has already gone.
He encountered unexpected obstacles.
Why are you alone?
I overslept because my alarm didn't go off.
She filled the glass with wine.
How do you know that you don't need a bodyguard?
I don't know who you are anymore.
Are you lost?
I know you've got more important things to do.
She had to use her dictionary many times.
Let's reconsider the problem.
They finished building the bridge on time.
She took a sip of her drink.
I think you panicked.
I know you haven't done it yet.
Of course, he is right.
You may go anywhere you like.
There was a strong wind on that day.
Did you have fun last night?
I'd like to have you on our team.
I ran ahead to warn everybody.
In Japan people come of age when they are 20 years old.
It's not hard to find.
He had an accident and broke his leg.
It was very painful.
He seems to be a nice fellow.
Should I pick up my ticket now?
You're very forward.
Where would you like to sit?
He didn't pass after all.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
I can't be unconcerned about your future.
I have time.
Do you really want to lead this kind of life?
We are not here to arrest you.
Tom is kind of creepy.
His office is on the eighth floor.
May I have your attention, please?
He had to leave the city, so he moved to Berlin.
We have things all worked out.
What's the weather like?
I hope they're friendly.
They love that song.
Tom plays tennis very well.
I sold my books cheaply.
I'm still thirsty.
Are you speaking English?
Never tell me a lie again.
Are you mentally ill?
Don't risk your fortune on that.
There are five patients in the waiting room.
They say that he's still alive.
I won't stay here alone.
Somebody has to be held accountable for his death.
Drugs can ruin your life.
Get the box.
She is about as tall as me.
Tom doesn't want to live in Boston.
He died of lung cancer.
He has too many books.
You're resilient.
Get your gear.
She is hard on them.
You won't be shot.
What did you buy it for?
I'm going on vacation next week.
Let go of my hair.
When did you begin learning English?
He was tricked into doing it.
I eat here.
I bet five dollars that he will not come.
They are very kind.
They are talking over a cup of coffee in the cafeteria.
Your effort will surely bear fruit.
I'm fed up with this wet weather.
The planes flew over the village.
I'll tell you afterwards.
I knew you were behind it.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I think that's everything.
I don't know how old I am.
She's going to Ooita.
I'm crazy about football.
Children often ask me for money.
Can we please turn this off?
She advised him not to buy a used car, but he didn't follow her advice.
The man robbed him of all his money.
I can't remember where this little doodad goes.
We communicated with each other by gesture.
A wink was his only answer.
He carried out his plan.
We had a little problem.
How can you be so callous?
She closed her eyes.
It will cost you more to go by plane.
We spent the afternoon cleaning our gear.
That's pretty much all you need to know.
Tom was flirting with Mary.
I don't need a lecture.
The rooms are all clean.
My grandfather was part Indian.
I need to go back to Boston for a funeral.
The house has icicles on it.
He made no effort to apologize.
What is his age?
I couldn't hear Tom.
Where do I go then?
Her oldest daughter got married.
I just can't help myself.
You can't drink seawater because it is too salty.
Beer bottles are made of glass.
Why don't we just sit here and talk?
She's in total denial about her husband's philandering.
Why don't you give up smoking?
Let's get back to the boat.
He's just a liar.
You look fat.
I just feel a little dizzy.
Will you guys please stop fighting?
How much sugar do you use?
I can't wait to die.
The curtains are closed.
How do you want to handle it?
You shouldn't eat just before going to bed.
We have no school tomorrow.
A bad habit is easily acquired.
We are going to his house. Want to come with?
Let me check it.
Give it to me straight.
I have to clean that up.
You are a good person.
As is often the case with young men, he does not pay much attention to his health.
Think of your family.
A cry arose from the crowd.
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
They let me go.
How do we find it?
I think you're right.
This is an interesting book to read.
They kept him waiting outside for a long time.
Don't let him do it alone.
You lied to us, didn't you?
He doesn't earn enough money to live on.
I can't believe we haven't run into each other before.
We can't waste even a minute.
Your cat is fat.
He did his best never to think of her.
Not everything that you read on the Internet is true.
My teacher told me that I should have spent more time preparing my presentation.
If it were not for water, no one could live on earth.
I know myself.
He helped me do my homework.
I don't really need your help.
He is not too old to do it.
It's OK to take a picture from outside.
I can't go now. I have work to do.
I can't believe you chickened out.
I looked at myself in the mirror.
I wonder if Tom knows what Mary did.
You're either with me or you're against me.
I enjoy your company.
You should carry out your promises.
It was such a pleasant day that we went for a walk.
I had to drag him out of bed.
My life is in your hands.
No one cares.
You need to save the princess.
I'm beginning to hate her.
I used to take a walk in the morning.
I didn't want you involved in this.
Do as he tells you.
No one is amused.
Tom is good at math.
I'm completely wrecked.
What's today's exchange rate?
I really can't take it anymore.
She is a stranger to me.
He knows a lot about flowers.
We love our country.
I'll keep it in mind.
I'm allergic to some medicine.
Someone has cut my kite string.
It's only getting bigger.
He is used to traveling.
Choose carefully.
I loved working here with you.
I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
I knew you would do something great.
The rescue workers are going to hand out supplies to the victims of the earthquake.
I think we'd better do what Tom asks.
There's not enough water.
You don't have to apologize.
What you spend time doing in your childhood affects the rest of your life.
Tom is a well-known singer.
Did I hear you talking to someone?

They're smiling at each other.
I don't have time to relax.
Tom has a lot of responsibilities.

Everybody wants to protect you.
This road is closed to cars.
I absolutely agree.
The president ignored the protesters outside his office.
There was a good reason for this.
Pass me the salt, please.
I went to bed after preparing everything in advance.
I know you don't like me.
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
If it rains tomorrow, we'll stay at home.
Where do you live now?
Were you happy?
When I was feeding my dog, I noticed that the gate had been left open.
You can't have both books.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
Do you know why they stopped talking?
This car looks pretty cool.
You haven't seen Tom this morning, have you?
She has a strong personality.
Someone was coming!
Tell Tom to shut up.
Let's try once again.
He had bruises all over after the fight.
I forgot to tell you something.
If there's anything at all that you don't understand, you can ask me anytime.
The brothers hate each other.
The story begins a long time ago.

Actions speak louder than words.
The door remained closed.
If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while.
I intend to study abroad next year.
I like this game.
Would you like a cup of tea?
Leave him alone.

I want to show you something in the office.
To be honest, I've never heard of this place before.
I didn't think of the consequences.
You like olives, don't you?
Cold this morning, isn't it?
Can we hurry this up?
I don't feel like smiling.
A nail punctured the tire.
There is not much possibility of his coming on time.
It was just hype.

Tom has dark skin.
How is your family name written?
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow.
He absconded with the money.
It was your mistake.
Are you a lawyer?
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
Why aren't you listening?
We know you're interested.
We have run out of sugar.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
I won't forget any of you.
I have to live on my very small income.
Do you want to watch a movie?
I figured you might change your mind.
I suppose that's impossible.
I will stop him from going.

He will be coming to the party, too.
I don't know what your problem is.
What do you feel like doing tonight?
The letters Tom wrote to Mary were returned unopened.
You must take care of your dog.
Tom didn't see it.
Why do you have to be like that?
I just got a call from the police.
Tom doesn't take very good care of his dog.
She doesn't eat meat, does she?
You have gone too far this time.
Tom looked at Mary and then winked at her.
He did it again.
They caught him playing a trick on his sister.
She wasn't dancing with him then.
I was ten minutes late for school.
Everyone ought to be the master of his own destiny.
Everything is on schedule.
What makes you think I'd want to see that?

I think it's too late.
I cut myself with a knife.
What a big dog!
I'm glad you came over.

I went to your school.
Do you carry a weapon?
We may as well start at once.
He can't do this kind of work, and she can't either.
I had to do everything alone.
May I have a talk with you?
Would you mind if I have a look?
Do you give to charity?
How do you feel about it?
Mary is cute.
She left the old newspapers lying in a heap.
Have you ever been married?
Our house faces the beach.
She used to love him.
That's a really good painting.
Tom may be a traitor.
I'll beat you up!
We live about three miles above this bridge.
I could tutor you.

I will choose one.
You still haven't told me how old you are.
Do you recognize the man in this photo?
I will get in touch with you.
I feel so alive right now.
He majors in modern literature.
Everybody wanted me to do it.
Look at that house.
I wonder who she is.
The difference between the right word and almost the right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.
That wasn't Tom's choice.
Give Tom what he wants.
I don't give second chances.
Tom wants me to help him.
Everyone seemed sad to see Tom go.
Please turn down the music.
I need you to go home.

You're such a flirt.
She liked that.
You don't need to thank me. I'm here to serve you.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Let me rephrase it.

Who are you talking about?
I'd like to buy a good dictionary.
I got my bicycle repaired.

They paid separately.
Prepare yourself.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
He has no equal in the field of electronics.
What was I thinking?
I would ask him if I were you.
There is no reason for this fear.

Enjoy yourself for a change.
I'm the one who asked you the question.
Now is the time.
Who is hiding behind the curtain?
The top of Mt. Fuji was covered with snow.
His eyes were full of tears.
He's not as tall as you are.
None of Tom's classmates liked him.

How tall you are!
I can't believe I'm not getting fired.
Could I borrow a saw?
She told the story with tears in her eyes.
I suppose you'll be studying all day tomorrow.
She told him that she believed in astrology.
I just can't keep my eyes open.
I am almost ready.
What he did wasn't wrong.
The following morning, the snowman was completely melted.
Tom and Mary don't get along.
I love my grandfather's anecdotes.
These clothes are not appropriate for a cold winter day.
I must adjust my watch. It's slow.
All the lights went out.
I want you home by midnight.
How long is your spring vacation?
It seems that he took me for my sister.
I don't care what he does.
You need a keycard to open the door.
I need to be alone for a while.
I withdrew some money from the bank for my trip.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
The sooner, the better.
Everybody in the car said they wanted to get out and stretch their legs.
Keep me in the loop.
We have not yet discussed which method is better.
Don't touch anything without asking.
They found out.
I have been a teacher for 15 years.
What else do you need?
Am I supposed to answer that question now?
I can carry that for you if you'd like me to.
That's about it.
We started a band because we were bored.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
It needs to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom explained his plan to Mary.
It doesn't go far enough.
Let go of the rope.
Tom doesn't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I have to talk to you alone.
I know Tom wants us to go swimming with him.
Why don't you stop worrying and get some sleep?
I am afraid that you will get lost.
He works in the car industry.
They agreed on everything.
Could you drop me off at the library?
Tonight is the night.
I can't remember where this little doodad goes.
This is very dangerous.
This made me very sad.
I am given a monthly allowance of fifty thousand yen.
Why is she so popular?
This flower is more beautiful than that rose.
They formed a swim team.
It is less muggy today than it was yesterday.
Don't do it again.
It is necessary to have a license to drive a car.
I figured you wouldn't come.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
She talked him into accepting the bribe.
Tom's heart suddenly began to beat faster.
Despite everything, Tom started to relax.
My office is on the fifth floor.
I'm going to reconsider it.
Where were you that whole time?
I'm from Turkey.
Cockfighting is illegal in many countries.
It's time-consuming.
You're forgiven.
I just wanted to say good luck.
We need an answer.
By the time you come back, I'll be gone.
Didn't your parents give you anything?
A car in the parking lot is on fire.
He does it faster than me.
She broke into tears.
We had no choice but to put up with it.
What did you buy?
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
I slept very well.
Tom looked through the binoculars.
I was on patrol.
The sky's clear today.
It was hard to believe.
I don't feel like singing.
Do you know your blood type?
I know how to settle this.
You must have thought of something.
The company released a press release.
Tom had every right to be angry.
He knows better than to believe such a thing.
The wind carries seeds for great distances.
I paid the bill.
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
I'm worried about them.
Are these your daughters?
Tell them we need an ambulance.
I don't recall you saying anything about that.
I'm not giving up.
We're Canadians.
You haven't said anything to Tom, have you?
I think this belongs to you.
I like this.
Are you the group leader?
I'm hanging a picture of my grandmother on the wall.
I wasn't the only one to do so.
Listen a minute.
There won't be anything left.
We will take your feelings into account.
I ate lunch in the cafeteria.
I don't like any of these hats.
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.
I used to have a girlfriend.
Don't let Tom do that.
He worked day and night so that his family could live in comfort.
You're being very unfair to me.
Ask at the police station over there.
He was killed by a blunt weapon.
He drank very little of the water.
I can't believe I'm here.
I just don't want to do that right now.
I want you and me to be happy.
Water is important for humans.
It was because he was sick that he decided to return home.
Do you want some coffee?
Where was I?
Am I disturbing you?
The injured man cried for help.
It's easier to make plans than to carry them out.
I'll take that as a yes.
Be careful not to fall.
She's about the same age as my sister.
I don't work there anymore.
I went on with my reading.
She can't even speak her native language without making mistakes.
How am I supposed to dress?
He jumped into the water.
Tom knew where Mary was, but he wouldn't tell the police where she was.
I'll destroy it.
Everybody needs to calm down.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
He was a tall man.
They're asleep.
How much would you want to pay for the tour?
Are you sure you're not tired?
Do you know where she is?
You aren't as short as me.
France is running a welfare state it can no longer afford.
I am sorry to cancel the appointment at the last minute.
We have half a dozen eggs.
What a fool I've been!
I'll certainly miss her.
Tom is now very angry with me.
The result was far from being satisfactory.
She held up her head.
My folks used to tell me stories about that.
I've been writing a lot.
You're going to laugh.
I got lost in the snow.
What do you say we buy everyone a drink?
She will be here before long.
That is mine.
She trusted you.
That's just a guess.
Tom still doesn't know what happened.
I'll put in a word for you.
You're wrong again.
She took a walk before breakfast.
She unbuttoned her shirt.
The parking lot in front of the bank was completely full.
I remember giving Tom some money.
I'm going to need your help.
I hope that's a joke.
I hardly ever run into him.
I hardly ever go to museums.
She put on dark glasses to protect her eyes from the sun.
How do you know you can trust Tom?
This isn't my problem.
I'd love to sing for you.
He hadn't eaten all day long and was very hungry.
We are staying at our uncle's.
I've got to get home.
We were just playing.
I'm not learning anything.
Sheep are bred for their fleece and their meat.
I got nothing.
I believe that he's happy.
Where did they get all this?
He made his will last year.
Tom doesn't want to take that kind of risk.
We didn't need to do that.
My whole family is doing well.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
You're out of time.
He was my first boyfriend.
I know I'm alone on this.
When did you get married?
Is this jasmine tea?
I got to the bus stop just after the bus had left.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Tom doesn't like cheese.
He is not strong as before.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
She seems to be in trouble. Tell her what to do.
I haven't read today's newspaper yet.
I was stupid enough to believe Tom.
No problem is insurmountable.
We found that everyone was asleep.
Why are you two always fighting?
I think you're jealous.
I didn't look.
They're different.
I want revenge.
You drive a hard bargain.
I'll choke the life out of him.
Study harder from now on.
I can't wait till summer.
I only eat meat from animals that I have personally killed and butchered.
Make it smaller.
We ate swordfish.
My best friend is in Rome now.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I forget your phone number.
You've had enough.
He did well in all subjects and, above all, in mathematics.
I don't feel like sitting down.
We can't guarantee that.
They live on the floor beneath.
She has a daughter named Mary.
I never spoke to him after that.
The basket was full of apples.
He lied to me. That is why I am angry with him.
He kept us waiting for a long time.
We'll join you shortly.
No one here has a car.
How does that make you feel?
I'm completely exhausted.
Not knowing what to do, I asked him for advice.
I generally agree with her.
It would be better for you not to ask him for advice.
You'd better go home at once.
You're not that old.
Is French a difficult language to learn?
Tom signed the documents.
It's almost time to get started.
I caught them in the act.

That is mine.
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
How did I not know that?
We've been working on this problem all weekend.
My sister has three times as many books as I do.
Do you think he will like it?
Even if he does something bad, he'll never admit it.
I finally won.
I have already done it.
This offer is available for five days.
Tell us all about it.
I lost track of the time.
I need paint.
I can't believe your mom made you wear that.
I don't think we want to go down that road.
We'll make a sailor out of you yet.
We'll do whatever it takes to get that done.
Could you draw a map for me?
I think I've persuaded Tom.
You live too far away.
Which is the more expensive of the two?
You're very talented.
He speaks English as fluently as any student in his class.
I know you recently retired.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Someone is standing behind the wall.
And while I'm at it, I have another question.
I know you'd prefer a bottle of red wine.
We have plenty of time to do that.
They'll stop at nothing to achieve their political goals.
Does she always go there?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
She went to the museum by taxi.
You're very intelligent.
You are so childish sometimes.

I can't tell you what to do.
I have seen her before.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
They were responsible for the accident.
You're a filthy liar!
His cousin lives in America.
I threw a ball to my dog and he caught it in his mouth.
I tried to help him.
Frankly speaking, this novel isn't very interesting.
All things considered, I think you should go back home and take care of your parents.
I still have some work to do.
He refused to pay.
I try not to use more paper than I need.
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?
I had trouble pronouncing his name.
Which applications do you like best?
I think we're related.
They released Tom.
Watch out! This monkey is vicious.
Let's go and investigate.
I think it's time for me to retire.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
Is everybody on board?
That statement is incorrect.
Would you like to come over for dinner?
He didn't protest.
I'm assuming you have a plan.
I can't say I'm sorry.
Fallen rocks blocked the way.
You're not fired.
He achieved his goal.

I'm right behind him.
The frogs' croaking helped me fall asleep.
Tom had a little accident.
They're students.
Pardon me?
You must pay in advance.

This time, you won't avoid your punishment.
No need to worry.
They canceled.
He's attracted to Asian women.
Do you think I'm stupid?

A day has twenty-four hours.
Who do you think came to see me yesterday?
He picked up a butterfly between his thumb and forefinger.
More money for education will spur economic growth.
How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
I'm not afraid at all.
I don't know what it is, but it's something very big.
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
She's depressed.
Is there a gas station around here?
You could do it if you really wanted to.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
You work hard.
I hope I see it again.
Tom was disappointed in Mary's performance.
I can't find it.
Suddenly, all the lights went out.
Do you carry weapons?
We have a few surprises in store for her.
Does the room have air conditioning?
I'm unconvinced.
A car that you never took out of the garage would be of no value to you.
We left the final decision to him.

I want to eat meat and vegetables.
We go to the same school.

I brought you another blanket.
He did it in front of the staff.
Pull the plant up by the roots.
He is more clever than me.
I need to see you tonight.
I know that she has been busy.
Please tell Tom I'm sorry.
Why aren't you all laughing?
I would rather stay home than go out.
I want to know who that is.
I pay most of my bills on the first of each month.
I knew that would interest you.
She wanted to go out anyway.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Do you have any plans for tonight?
The village is connected with our town by a bridge.
Why are you interested?
The population of the city is about 100,000.
You said you wanted a family.
It no longer matters.
Aren't you afraid of anything?
Tom did all he could do to help.
I just don't want there to be any bloodshed.
I'm tough.
They smiled at each other.
I am interested in chess these days.
Last night someone broke into the small shop near my house.
We always have a party on his birthday.
I look forward to seeing you on my next trip to your city.
Tell me this isn't happening.
I don't mind at all.
Here, have a drink.
I want to ask you a question.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
I think you'll want to hear me out.
Don't try too hard!
That's her boyfriend.
He should come.
Did you see the transcript?
Keep focused on your work.
You have no right to do this.
I don't have to apologize for what I said.
Which one do you like better?
We have two daughters.
My father encouraged me to learn how to play the piano.
You ruined everything.
Are you in danger?
That is the sort of job I am cut out for.
I owe you so much.
Do you recycle?
Everyone's shocked.
As soon as I find it, I'll bring it over to your place.
I assume you don't want this.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
Is that machine still usable?
She bought a shirt for him.
You should be able to walk in a few days.
If you listen to English programs on the radio, you can learn English for nothing.

There's no escape.
I don't think about you.
Here is their photo album.
He censured me for what I had done.
Do you mind if we join you?
I have no clue what you're talking about.
I seldom eat dairy products.
Those roses are very beautiful.
I like this job.
He said he would see me the next day.
I never talked to him again.
How many books do you possess?
I was just trying to stop the fight.
Tom has short legs.
You're not very tidy.
The boy sat on a chair.
I can't save you this time.
Tom poured milk into a bowl for his cat.
You won't have your way.
I'd like to visit England someday.
They agreed to elect him as president.
Compared to our house, his is a palace.
They said it's OK.
I wish I had your job.
It's impossible to take on more work at the moment.
Everyone was alert.
I've messed up.
If you do that, everyone's going to hate you.
I will never do it again.
Don't you just love it here?
Can someone tell me where the keyboard is?
Are you Japanese?
I have to change clothes.
That girl is Mary.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
Don't be fooled by his good looks.
I'm afraid I have to go now.
Many restaurants now have free Wi-Fi.
They gave up.
Some dogs are very smart.

So what were we talking about?
We're not really friends anymore.

I think there's something you're not telling me.
We're not lost.
I haven't gotten paid yet.
I don't need a girlfriend.
The workers are on strike.
Put your coat back on.
How high is that mountain?
You're the only one who can help me.
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
I have a wooden comb.
Tom loves you.
I'll give you a ride home.
Hand it over.
I had no idea Tom would do that.
She gets herself worked up over every little thing.
What happened last night?
I want to do this on my own.
Do you know how that feels?
Did anyone see you on the beach?
You can't help me.
This has all been a misunderstanding.
He was too stunned to talk.
I look forward to it.
I can't wait for tomorrow to come.
His view is quite logical.
A fierce battle was fought by the soldiers.
I hate lawyers.
There's no need to exaggerate.
We're having a blast.
I got my right leg injured.
He's not sure he wants to do this.
Tom is conscientious, isn't he?
Did I startle you?
I need to go feed the chicken.
How many years was Tom in Boston?
The government owed millions of dollars.
That's a pretty strange-looking bracelet you're wearing.
Don't leave them alone.

Here's your pudding.
No problem.
I have two children to support.
Nobody will say it so bluntly, but that is the gist of it.
I did nothing.
I don't like that name.
I read it to my family.
I hadn't thought of that.
He calculated that it would cost him 100 dollars.
I'm not in the office today.
You'll sleep better tonight.
We were very tired from the five-hour trip.
I'm sorry about your loss.
I'm always forgetting people's names.
Tom didn't want to do anything.
I have no choice but to take the red-eye back to New York.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
Are those for me?
He is about forty.
Everywhere you look you can see damage caused by the earthquake.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
Excuse me, but may I open the window?
Either he is wrong or I am.
I look forward to our next meeting.
Stop, or I'll shoot.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
I continued working.
I am reading a book.
If you mix blue and red, you'll get purple.
You need to respect the elderly.
What do you have in mind?
Are you going to go with me or not?

I met Tom when I was thirteen.
Who was that woman I saw you with?
Let's drop by his house.

She bought six yards of cloth for a dress.
Hold still.
Are you still married?
What's all the fuss about?
Look up the number in the telephone book.
She will have a child next month.
You're extroverted.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
She threw herself into my arms.
What's your address?
I'm busy, too.
She almost passed out.
We have to be cautious.
What are you going to do this evening?
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
You're observant.
I'm not leaving with you.
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
She changed her schedule to match his.
I recognized him at first glance.
He left his wife an enormous fortune.

The sky is getting brighter.
I'm hardworking.
I had to defend myself.
If you ever come to town, come to see me.
Her son is a genius.
Was that a yes?
I can't take this any longer.
It wasn't all that bad.
We are in the era of atomic energy.
I'm not going to tell you my name.

One hot summer afternoon, John and Dan were cutting the long grass.
We're committed.

Do not be so critical.
We came together.
Tom is not yet able to swim.
What makes you think Tom would ever consider going on a date with Mary?
Invite whoever you like.
They basked in the sun.
He concentrated on his studies.
We were lucky.
He drank a shot of whiskey.
I'd rather read.
Are you going to do something about it?
Are you interested in politics?

I'm not sure about this.
I'm happy you're here.
I've gone to Kyoto twice.

How long will this cold weather continue?
Tom can't do anything about that.
Count to thirty.
I didn't tell you to sit.
You look just like your father.
Tom likes Mary's long black hair.
That's a very interesting question.

Don't interrupt me! Can't you see I am talking?
Please keep me informed.

Don't you wish you lived here?
They say he's very rich.
We have not yet begun to fight.
I'm not tired at all.
I've asked you this question before.
I should've known.
Tom looked around, but Mary was already gone.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
She shot a gun.
The last thing I want to do now is clean the bathroom.
My mother was usually very busy.
I'm now unarmed.
I have nothing to do with that crime.
Apparently, that's not correct.
We weren't all that busy.
That doesn't happen a lot.
I hope that you won't make the same mistake as Tom.
Why are you all dressed up?
Can you lend me your bicycle?
Tom doesn't like to lose.
Columbus' discovery of America was accidental.
Gas cookers consume half the amount of energy as electric cookers.
I can't take my glasses off.
I just feel a little dizzy.
She asked him if he was a student at this school.
I usually go to school by bus.
He was found lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
A map helps us to know where we are.
He was destined never to meet her again.
This is the last time I'm going to remind you.
I really am very busy.
You should prepare for the future.
I won't be able to attend the conference.
You're the only person I know that likes getting up early in the morning.
I saw a figure approaching in the distance.
From my point of view, it would be better to wait a little longer.
He lost a fortune in the stock market.
She always has to be the one giving orders.
He was disappointed.
Your name, please.
Trees do not grow on prairies.
I'm happy with it.
I accept your offer.
Why are you out of breath?
Take a closer look.
I don't object to your going out to work, but who will look after the children?
This heater burns gas.
I really wish I could be there with you.
Our hotel faces the coast.
How did you all get here?
How about tomorrow?
I was born on June 4, 1974.
Please stop playing with your hat.
I think I'll turn in now.
I chanced to meet him at the airport.
What a nice tie!
I don't want you to be upset.
I'm glad to see you again.
Is there a reason that you're asking?
Did you know this was coming down?
He managed to pass the examination.
If he'd been there, he'd have told you to mind your manners.
All you have to do is press the button.
They're in danger.
I'm sick of conferences these days.
I know what you were doing.
My wife and I did our Christmas shopping in October.
I think that's just what I need right now.
If you want to, we'll go.
I like coffee better than tea.
She kept various kinds of pets.
I can't untie this knot.
Tom won't let anyone in the house.
It was a nice party.
I'll introduce you to a nice girl.
I started a new blog. I'll do my best to keep it going.
She was heard playing the violin.

We all deserve respect.
He runs well for his age.
The number of employees doubled in ten years.
I have to change tires.
Tom asked me if I liked Chinese food.
Tom is the owner.
What a cute baby!
The door opened and a man came out.
I didn't look at my feet.
There's no shortage of work around here.
You're not dead yet.
I feel way more comfortable now.
Are you home?
What's the idea?
Come up here.
Tom looked at the floor.
I assumed you were happy.
I totally understand.
I want a knife to cut the rope with.
He hung on to his job.
Humans are the only living creatures that make use of fire.
I bought it in a thrift store.
This is totally worthless.
We depend on you.
I've never seen two people so much in love as Tom and Mary.
We're not proud of it.
I have been here since five o'clock.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
I thought you might be upset.
You did this.
The number is 932-8647, but I don't know the area code.
I just want to hold her hand.
I no longer wish to be a part of this project.
She left her children.
I'll be checking on you.
You really didn't know, did you?
As always, he got up early in the morning and went jogging.
I hope your wishes will come true.
He needed to rest.
I didn't realize you were so rich.
Tom swims very fast.
I love trips.
Where did you get the idea?
She was forced to confess.
I'll take the next bus.
Even if it costs 10,000 yen, I must buy the dictionary.
Tom bought Mary lots of jewelry.
Something was wrong with the watch.
Could I have the bill, please?
Will you watch the Olympics?
Why don't you sing for us?
They were drinking champagne.
I really didn't have time.
I thought I saw a ghost.
Are you almost ready?
Is it comprehensive?
A very large number of tourists visit Kyoto in the spring.
Who else knows about your secret?
I got a fish bone stuck in my throat.
How many men named Tom do you know?
Lightning precedes thunder.
We understand this.
Good evening, everyone.
I had a sharp pain in my chest yesterday.
I think you must be getting tired.
Tom hit rock bottom.
You're a nerd.
The United States has officially ended economic sanctions against Burma.
We have another ten miles to walk before sunset.
I may outlive you.
I know each one of you.
Can I borrow your computer?
Is it bad?
It must be nice having someone who sticks around even when times get tough.
That's what I was thinking, too.
Empty your pockets!
Did you call me last night?
I just told everybody the good news.
Tom wasn't ready to accept Mary's love or friendship.
I don't live around here.
Do you really think it's bad?
Her eyes were filled with tears.
Would you like to know how I did that?
I thought you might want a drink.
The game's almost over.
You're very rude.
You should never cut corners on safety.
What do you learn English for?
I awoke to find everything had been a dream.
I can't do anything for Tom.
I ran all the way to the station.
Do you disagree?
You're the one who planted that tree.
I'm sure Tom will be home soon.
Nobody was allowed to go out of the room.
I have no idea how to use this thing.
Don't make me shoot you again.
Tom won't let you go.
I didn't have the sense to do so.
I found a pair of sunglasses by the swimming pool.
I hope you're not alone.
No one listens to me when I talk.
We finally have you where we want you.
Do come and visit us.
How long do you think they have been married?
His bag is right here, so he cannot have gone to school yet.
I'm not surprised you don't remember.
There's been a complication.
That's all I do.
Are you sure we have enough beer?
I can ride a horse, too.
I dislocated my shoulder.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Nothing has been heard from him since he left for America.
Now let's get down to work.
Stop grumbling.
I live in a two story house.
Do you mind if I ask a few questions?
I think your answer is correct.
I was born in Osaka.
I remember it well.
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
I want a puppy.
Can I bum a cigarette off you?
I went to the hospital to have my eyes tested.
Please stop singing that song.
This just isn't like you.
I recommend it highly.
When did you start writing songs?
That reminds me of my father.
It's just a matter of time.
I'd like this fight to end.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
The house with the green roof is mine.
I really couldn't have done this without you.
The door was unlocked.
I have my share of doubts.
I see them.
You'd better not go.
Let's drink.
I thought you were older than me.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
Have you already met her?
You will never defeat me!
I really do have to go.
Most people are very passionate about something.
Check these out.
His criticisms were very severe.
My explanation may sound strange.
He's my age.
This is bad.
She talked to the chairman.
I like your tie.
I don't have any problems at all.
Tom opened a window.
He didn't protest.
It's not natural.
Hang on. We'll be right there.
I'll wash the dishes.
Now, it's time to celebrate.
You were kind to help me.
Tom doesn't look rich to me.
He handed in his resignation to his boss.
They're acting on their own.
I am ready to do anything for you.
I work on Sunday.
I finally talked her into lending me the book.
Let go of me.
It can be difficult.
You're still green.
If you eat a light lunch, you're likely to avoid a mid-afternoon energy slump.
You seem to have the wrong number.
He sounds angry.
I'm playing with my friends.
What am I up against?
I can't sleep at night.
Tom collapsed on the floor.
It seems to me that this is too expensive.
Are you all completely crazy?
Don't hesitate to ask for advice.
Show me what you've done so far.
My father visited my uncle in the hospital.
Don't obey him.
The students were ill at ease before the exam.
I finally have enough money to buy the kind of car I've always wanted.
You're too old for me.
Could you describe to the jury what happened?
Haven't you eaten lunch?
This is the hottest summer we have had in fifty years.
In the end, he did not come.
She couldn't fall asleep because she was thinking about him.
Is there anyone else around?
It happens more often than you would think.
I'm starting to have fun on my new job.
Are you making fun of me?
He turned the corner.
Where can I buy bricks?
That is so cool.
Not everyone can be a poet.
Don't lose sight of what you're here for.
You can only use it once.
Have you read anything interesting lately?
Sometimes I wish I had a different religion.
We haven't been to Boston in a long time.
She is among those unaccounted for.
I'm not as smart as you.
"Says who?" "Says me."
We had a heated discussion about it.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
I wanted to come.
The teacher told him not to forget his books.
Can the baby walk?
I owe him my life.
It was raining heavily when I got up this morning.
The military engaged the enemy five kilometers south of the capital.
Attention please!
He has braces.
I got over it. You should, too.
Life imitates art more often than the other way around.
Where is the library?
Nobody knows the answer.
Whose book is that?
It's getting dark outside.
Is it any warmer inside?
He's on his last legs.
I had no idea you were involved.
You're not my friend anymore.
Your father got a promotion.
You must go to school.
This news is official.
She sat next him with her eyes closed.
Don't follow me.
Just be glad you're OK.
I want you to take this medicine.
Give it to me.
My primary concern is your safety.
The rooms in this hotel are pretty basic.
She slapped his face.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
You're trustworthy.
I don't remember anything about that.
This is pretty.
Do we have time for another cup of coffee?
You're not one of us, are you?
I have never heard him lie.
I think that she knows the truth.
You can reach me at the address written here.
I agreed to the proposal.
I will go if you go.
It's all so hopeless.
She was accused of telling a lie.
She still loved him.
I like hiking in the mountains.
Tom is writing on the blackboard.
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
I felt like an idiot.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I changed the arrangement of the furniture in my room.
They were ready to run the risk of being shot by the enemy.
The more unique each person is, the more he contributes to the wisdom of others.
Stop yelling at me.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
I haven't eaten anything unusual since I've returned home from my trip around the world.
We'll talk later.
They were panting.
I'm not a fan.
I've locked myself out of my house.
Nothing we have done today has gone according to plan.
That chicken hasn't laid any eggs lately.
Don't get angry. It won't help you.
He was sick of his job.
You know I don't dance.
Tom's family is powerful.
Do you have a temperature?
Your cat will survive.
We have no means of transportation.
The girl had a large red hat on.
No weapon was found.
Anybody could do this.
One hour of sleep before midnight is worth two hours after.
I felt guilty about it.
I refuse to allow it.
His childhood was harsh.
Do you have to go now?
Our team lost the first game.
I need to wash my hands.
You always want to control everything.
He lived in France for some time, then went to Italy.
What's not to like?
The war broke out in 1939.
Governments should not be in the business of legislating morality.
Are you coming to the store with me?
You need a joystick.
Are you sure you're not tired?
It goes without saying that honesty is the key to success.
It's not at all typical.
I really like city life.
Let me check.
When I grow up I want to be just like you.
I'd make a good chaperone.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
We should stick to our plan.
I might say yes.
I didn't try to kill anybody.
I demand that he be punished.
You're annoying.
What time will you have breakfast?
You should be more careful.
English is spoken in Australia.
I think Tom came here to tell us something important.
I made him sweep the floor.
He made fun of our ignorance.
She went to the station to see him off.
He can do five somersaults without breaking a sweat.
Well, you've convinced me.
You may kiss the bride.
Why didn't you come to the party?
It seems that they took the wrong train.
Do you know why he has been absent from school?
I guess I've been better.
What direction are you going?
I need it.
There's no rush.
He got caught.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear.
Sleep is no less necessary to health than food.
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
Where's the whipped cream?
I can't get rid of my pimples.
Why are you busy today?
I think that's really important.
I'm already done.
The fact is that he didn't even take the exam.
Even though my friend was a vegetarian, I didn't tell him that the soup had some meat in it.
I write in my diary every day.
Do you want to join them?
Put the pliers in the tool box.
I didn't know anyone was there.
I had a raincoat on so I didn't get so wet.
They study in the afternoon.
Stop acting like a child.
What a pretty woman!
I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.
Will you sing some English songs for us?
Is there anything you need?
They're too fat.
Tom couldn't go anywhere without his dog.
I think you should leave.
Why don't you sit and have a drink with me?
We enjoyed watching the fireworks on a bridge last summer.
Tom bought three pairs of shoes.
Are those for me?
Most whales feed on plankton.
I think we should follow Tom.
You don't seem so smart.
My family will be away for a week.
I'm not selling you my car.
It seems those two are made for each other.
I thought the little boy who was staring and pointing at the foreigner was very rude.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
Tom was a very tough opponent.
Get out of my seat.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
She would have failed without his help.
I called my friend after arriving at the station.
From time to time, I think about my mother who is no longer living.
Slow down.
I want your answer by the end of the day.
I think we all should have been more careful.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
My son is going to leave for France next week.
I know he did it.
We sat there.
I like your mirror.
I felt like reading the detective story.
Have you been to Boston?
Since I had a cold, I was absent from school.
That's a completely unfounded rumor.
I know him.
I have three times as many books as him.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
One thing I've always wanted to do is go camping with my family.
He bought me a new dictionary.
He asked me to do it.
There's no need for her to go there herself.
Is that what you want to do?
Do you want some water?
Where can I rent a car?
Someone's knocking on the door.
I don't know what could've happened.
They took a big risk.
There is a television in the room.
I want to go over a few things with you.
How long did you stay in Canada?
He can't be trusted.
Settle down for a while and concentrate.
Don't look into the box.
Tom was sitting alone in his room.
The man aimed a gun at the policeman.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
She's just a child.
I'd like to ask you some questions now.
She didn't want him to pamper the children.
He filed a complaint.
Nobody told me you were here.
Plastic kills countless seabirds and sea turtles each year.
Where did the money come from?
I can't do this anymore.
I'm still part of this family.
Which is your suitcase?
Every year, many older people die in road accidents.
We're not so different, you and I.
Maybe I should go with you.
The chair is far from the door.
He went out in spite of the rain.
Be more flexible.
I didn't run away from home.
Tom asked Mary several questions.
No one followed me.
Flour is made from wheat.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
She shrieked.
Does this bus go to the museum?
We have two children.
I often stay up all night.
That is his car.
We appreciate your understanding.
Tell us what you want to do.
How do you do that?
I had a good coach.
That's what I thought, too.
He asked her to marry him, but she refused.
He would let me help him.
You won't feel a thing.
Tom said he'd only talk to you.
No one said anything about that.
Japanese tourists can be found everywhere.
Go back to where you belong.
I must go now.
Tom ran as fast as he was able to.
Tom is biting his nails.
She took me under her wing and taught me everything she knows.
You'll be fine.
Is that a bullet hole?
I just love beautiful women.
She is her friend.
The universe was born more than 12 billion years ago.
Please make yourself comfortable.
There is no salt left.
Where's the Red Cross?
Are you going to work until 10:00?
It is out of the question.
Isn't she a doctor?
I believe you have my umbrella.
He went to bed because he was tired.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
I am very sensitive to heat.
Tom hid Mary's doll behind the door.
He's a cat lover.
I'd like to run a big stock farm.
Do you go there often?
Do you go by bus, by train, or by subway?
I was not sure what to do.
Can I get an advance on my salary?
He is beyond hope.
You've done well here.
That's a big blow.
I know what it's like to be poor.
Are you an only child?
We'll always be together.
It's dangerous!
What would he know?
She went into the kitchen to see who was there, but there was nobody there.
Tom and Mary decided to leave.
I recently had surgery.
I just want you to think about that.
She can play the piano very well.
My mother has gone shopping.
There's no way to predict what you will dream tonight.
We've all seen it.
I suppose that's why you don't like me so much.
Did he get a receipt?
Will you be at home tonight?
We'll be careful.
Do you have everything?
He is painting a picture.
Tom saw his former employer at a conference.
Tom lacks confidence in himself.
Think outside the box.
I don't want to upset you.
You should go on a diet.
It might not even work.
It could be dangerous.
His prediction might come true.
Does anybody know him?
I can't believe you fell for that.
Is there anything you need?
I want to do this.
I do not believe that God exists.
My car is not running.
I'd like to have dinner with you tonight.
He bored us with his long stories.
I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
I'm going out for a drink.
He doesn't have a hat on.
He has a camera.
I felt excited.
It's a pleasant day, isn't it?
You can't go outside.
I want you to be my friend again.
I'm going off to Vancouver next week to see my sister.
Which student went out?
I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I heard the news.
Thanks to you, I arrived on time.
Did you see it?
I don't work here.
"Are those your books?" "No, they aren't."
My mother prepares my meals.
How much is this sofa?
The situation became worse by the minute.
I made you cookies.
That's not exactly how it happened.
He needs you.
It's very difficult to understand him.
Do you know who she is?
I am very glad school is over.
I was born in Osaka, but brought up in Tokyo.
That's why I'm here.
How long are you going to keep giving me the silent treatment?
Let's not go into details.
I have been busy.
Hand me a towel.
I dislike cold weather.
It is not clear what the writer is trying to say.
I want this cat.
Is the response positive?
I've just finished dinner.
She won first prize in the speech contest.
Tom quickly realized that something was wrong.
Oh, didn't I mention it?
Who planted the tree?
I'm going to swim every day.
I told the children to be quiet, but they just kept on being noisy.
I want to go to sleep soon because I need to get up early tomorrow.
Her hair is very short.
I've met that girl before.
Tom followed me to the garage.
Rabid dogs usually foam at the mouth.
We look out for each other.
I wish I could be in Paris now.
As long as we live, we have to work.
Please cut along the dotted line.
I had a crush on you when I was twelve.
Tom couldn't stand Mary not knowing what had happened.
That's not in the file.
That soon changed.
Don't put the wet towel in the bag.
I've been wrong.
We have had bad weather recently.
Can you supply me with all I need?
It's going nicely!
Why didn't you come?
There is one apple on the desk.
The cat scared me.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
The phone rang for a long time.
Can I get you something to drink?
She asked him to give her some money.
I can't be seen with you.
They know we're cops.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
You look nervous.
He went there in person.
I don't compromise.
We hope to meet you again.
You have a point there.
They caught a lion alive.
You must have lost them.
It was really interesting.
I think you might like it.
What do you like to cook the most?
He has enough money to buy it.
I can't let them catch you.
I appreciate your vigilance.
We met her by accident.
You can fix all this.
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.
Please be careful.
I aim to be a doctor when I grow up.
She advised him to go on a strict diet.
Why are you being weird?
Stop pulling my hair!
Did you take him back to your apartment?
I'm not very hungry.
Is this your bike?
Tom doesn't like to speak French.
He gathered up his things and left.
Can you swim as fast as he can?
Mary went on a voyage around the world.
It's simpler and more reliable.
I stayed there until he had left.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
I have no friend to talk with.
It was too difficult for me.
He drives a pickup truck.
I want to play, too.
Do you promise?
Who were they talking about?
Who sent this to us?
The day isn't over yet.
I hope you'll agree.
He was nearly drowned.
Please be careful.
You don't have to be so rude.
Don't you have work today?
Would you like to sleep a little longer?
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
We can't let this continue.
He does not have anyone to play with.
Frankly speaking, I don't like her.
I saw the man enter the room.
I will not be busy tomorrow.
I want a match. Do you have one?
What are you crunching on?
I go to any party I am invited to.
You won't bleed to death.
As soon as the child saw his mother, he stopped crying.
Tom groaned loudly.
Mary has a flower in her hand.
Our mother had no choice but to make dinner with leftovers.
Follow him.
I didn't try to go any further.
I made a deal.
I thought you'd want to take a look.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
I'm looking for someone.
He is the only one of my friends that is talented.
I'm going to sleep on it.
It sounds easy.
Tom bought a new tennis racket.
Can I talk to you a sec?
We played an entertaining game of charades after dinner.
My mother said that she was all right.
I'm still not ready yet.
We're cooperating.
I write almost every day.
I love bananas.
I'm glad you liked it.
You're free.
You should buy it for yourself.
Make a wish and blow out the candles.
You have a lot of nerve!
She raised her hand for the bus to stop.
We're shocked.
The issue is quite familiar to us.
He is nothing but a child.
I'd be delighted.
Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
Your pronunciation is excellent.
He stamped out the fire.
Happy Valentine's Day.
I'm not worried about you.
Contact my son.
It's very big of you to admit you're wrong.
He is not a patient but a doctor in this hospital.
Tom hates homework.
I'm blessed.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Did I blow it?
The main character dies at the end of the book.
No one knows what'll happen in the future.
Are you through with the newspaper?
That is very expensive!
Tom pushed Mary out the window.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
Why aren't you talking to me?
We saw a stranger walking outside.
The company spends a lot of money on advertising.
Are you sure of your answer?
Are you allergic to any medicine?
Mary is as pretty as her sister.
We should get more organized.
They called them scalawags.
Is that really you?
I want to know what you see right now.
He looks after us.
He thought the matter over for three days.
He still hasn't responded to my letter.
When did you get there?
He looked asleep, but he was really dead.
Let me do my job.
I have things I want to do.
No one answered.
It's none of my business!
You are very insensitive.
The crops have withered.
Don't ever talk to me like that again.
He has never been late for school.
I want to go over it again in more detail.
This winter has been mild.
Hurry up, or you will miss the train.
I think we all know the rules.
Just a moment ...
I hope you're wrong.
They're rich.
I am ready to go with you.
I seem to have caught a bad cold.
I want this luggage taken to my room at once.
We all wished for peace.
This is strictly between us.
The student raised his hand.
I'm sorry. I know I overreacted.
They're right behind you.
They went on a trip a few days ago.
Russian is very difficult to learn.
How long has he been dead?
Why would you ask that?
Are you trying to kill me?
What's all the hubbub about?
Write it down here, please.
Stay with us.
I've found another job.
I want to read the book.
I'm not surprised.
Contact me tomorrow.
The novel has sold almost 20,000 copies.
I did not meet anyone.
We exchanged greetings.
That's very impressive.
I enjoy working.
You're the one who planted that tree.
I thought you would say that.
That's not for you to decide.
Why did you come over here?
Don't try to be a hero.
I want you to try it.
Tom's death was an accident.
I want something sweet.
Where have you been all this while?
When did that happen?
We can't say any more at this time.
I'm not able to fix the computer.
Do you want me to handle this?
She was advised by him to get more exercise.

This is the picture that Mary painted.
Can you believe what he said?
Ask your parents for permission.
A cup of coffee, please.
You may take photos outside this museum, but not inside.
Why is it that you are always late?
Get down.
I can't remember how to go there.
Did you hear the news?
Tom is always open to new ideas.
I have to find that.
I think you should grow a beard.
"What would you like?" "I would like a dog."
I'm not done with you yet.
I never drink alone.
I'll turn around while you change.
I am starting the year as sick as a dog.
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I had enough sense to get out of there.
I must study.
Tom is genuinely concerned.
Oceans do not so much divide the world as unite it.
Prices went up.
Do you eat rice in your country?
I really hurried.
I've never been in love before.
Pink is not just for girls.
I think we all know what's happening.
It is kind of pretty, isn't it?
It's ahead of schedule.

Seen from the moon, the earth looks like a ball.

What would you do in my place?
Tom returned to his office.
I figured I'd find you here.
Tom is eating breakfast right now.
Tom was pacing in his room, unable to calm himself down.
I'd like to have your answer right away.
You should go home early.
She's open-minded.
Forests cover around 9.4% of the earth's surface.
Tom opened the curtains.
He is accustomed to speaking in public.
You're overworked.
I don't remember anything happening.
I wonder who invented it.
After the game, he went straight home to feed his dog.
Can you pitch?
You'd be amazed how long it takes Tom to get ready in the morning.
I think you should stick to your training schedule.
Get me some water.
We'll let you know the result within a week.
We walked to my room.
This museum is worth a visit.
He stole her watch.
The bull is stronger than the bullfighter, but he almost always loses.
I am playing video games.
He's waiting for you at home.
She didn't want him to play poker.
You have no taste.
I lied to my boyfriend about my age.
Let me die.
Can you help me on this one?
I couldn't stand it any longer.
It's not too far.
This is a sociological study on abortion.
We better tell the others.
Do you understand me?
I often drink tea.
It's your duty to finish the job.
Tom looked closer at the food.
I don't want you anywhere near the medicine cabinet.
She was captured trying to steal jewelry.
He felt it was his duty to go.
The geyser sends up a column of hot water every two hours.
I don't think being poor is anything to be ashamed of.

You're ambitious.
My uncle lived abroad for many years.
Don't make this personal.

We've now been together for nearly three years.
Do you want to get us both killed?
She and I usually agree.
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you.
Tom can't tie his own shoes.
At last, he realized his mistakes.
In case of fire, break this window.
He gathered up his things and left.
I'll follow you anywhere.
Are there any bags in this shop?
I was impressed with what I saw.
No one is around.
When did you begin learning German?
Do you know the answer?
Tom was horrified when he noticed that his daughter had had her tongue pierced.
He doesn't want to get out of bed.
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
Please forgive me for not answering your letter.
Workers struggled as factories closed.
Never make the mistake of arguing with people for whose opinions you have no respect.
Are you going to eat that?
She didn't want him to die.
Please do something about it.
He's outraged.
She gave him a sweater.
Tom smiled halfheartedly.
I am in a spot.
He is satisfied with the result.
I don't like either of them.
You're all happy.
She's a real gossip.
Why did she come home early?
My car needs washing.
We go mountain climbing almost every weekend.
My sister is crazy about tennis.
No sooner had she opened the door than a cat ran out.
Please be polite.
I can't express myself in French very well.
You made an error.
We can't help you with that.
He used to eat out every day, but now he can't afford it.
I fell asleep in class.
I am sorry for you.
Don't your neighbors ever complain?
He says that he enjoyed it very much.
Can we talk in private?
You don't have to answer.
I took care of it for you.
I study English at home.
He's not paying any attention to me.
Here is your bag.
Some people like cats, others prefer dogs.
I'm sorry to see Tom go.
I figured I had enough money.
I thought Tom was a farmer.
He showed me his photograph album.
Aren't you hungry?
They are all my personal belongings.
Did I wake you?
I woke up.
What a total idiot!
Just imitate what he does.
He seems to be asleep.
I love horses.
I'm sure everything will be fine.
Whose is this bag?
You can't leave.
He jumped out of bed.
If you want to master a foreign language, you must study as much as possible.
He begged her to forgive him.
Old people deserve respect.
That fact can't be denied.
They were surprised by what they saw.
I talk to myself.
He looks pale. He must have drunk too much last night.
This is a pen.
This is the reason why I didn't come yesterday.
You can't blame this on me.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
You may be right about that.
Could you repeat that?
We'll be late for class.
Keep children away from the pond.
I'm not counting.
I think this is what you're looking for.
Stop joking around.
We must sit down.
She eats lunch here from time to time.
I'm sure he'll leave early.
Kyoto is worth visiting.
I can't believe you're doing this.
I go to work.
I appreciate you calling me.
Don't call me so late at night.
I'd like to do shopping on Fifth Avenue in New York.
No one says that anymore.
Have you seen my purse?
I'm sure you don't want to do that.
Those kinds of methods are out of date.
Don't they drive you mad?
Drink more water.
The bus stopped suddenly in the middle of the street.
Thanks to both of you.
When did the robbery take place?
This is not natural.

She will accompany me on the piano.
Is this all yours?
We speak French.
We try to go to Boston at least once a year.
He is very careful.
I had such a happy childhood.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
The children love listening to fairy tales.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
This is mine, and this is yours.
In spite of the fact that she was busy, she came to see me.
I always thought this would be the right thing to do.
Tom quit school.
We're losing.
I'm going to see Mary this afternoon.
She took him for all his money.
My sister sang an English song at the party.
I glanced through the brochure.
Do I have to change my diet?
He speaks French.
Walk this way.
There's so much I want to show you.
We found it.
I thought I had a day off.
This is my beer.
All of the students stood up together.
We became good friends.
Keep all medicines out of reach of children.
Luckily, the weather turned out fine.
Would you like another drink?
I wish I could've spoken to Tom.
That feels very nice.
She went out.
I gave him my address.
He speaks English a little.
The sun will soon set.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
Take what you want.
You are too late.
Are you enjoying yourself?
A great responsibility lies on his shoulders.
I'm looking forward to receiving your reply.
Let me grab my bag.
I'm reluctant to visit him.
He didn't answer my question.
Kyoto depends on the tourist industry.
May I have a bus route map?
I'm tired of all this nagging.
Nobody will notice.

Am I being unreasonable?
I've tried to contact Tom.
He had long hair.
Mother went shopping with my brother.
I want to lose weight.
Don't climb up the wall.
Does it even matter?
A fuse has blown.
I've decided.
Tom had better hurry or he'll miss the bus.
Compared to you, I'm just a beginner at this game.
The only thing that matters is whether or not your teacher thinks your report is good enough.
This coat is rainproof.
He treats me as an adult.
I already said that.
Do you have any children you haven't told me about?
You don't understand what's happening.
What are your weekend plans?

Thanks for saving me.
He speaks English as if he were an American.
Tom made three errors.
You killed my father.
How did we get into this situation?
I see they've put you to work.
This is almost too easy.
Wipe your feet before coming in.
Have you turned in your report?
I lost my flashlight.
I'm just not feeling up to it right now.
We were one too many.
All they had was each other.
Your suggestion seems irrelevant to our discussion here.

You're sleepy.
Those three are his daughters.
The room was dark.
How did you do this?

You're really gorgeous.
Why not have dinner with us?
Be careful about what you eat.
I did something I regretted doing.
He's away on business.
He went back home.
Talking to him always puts me in a good mood.
Yesterday, a thief entered the house.
They wanted protection.
I remember seeing you last year.
We've seen drastic changes since then.
Give me a drink, please.
This is acceptable.

His secretary can speak three languages well.
You're better off not getting in his way!
This could have unintended consequences.

Are you threatening me?
I feel blessed.

As we grow older, our memory becomes weaker.
I caused an accident.
Don't let them get you down.
Is that your dog?
I trusted them.
They finished their meal.
I prefer plain materials.
He never told anyone.
I just gave blood.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
I don't really need this.
He often eats fish for dinner.
Are you registered?
He came at about four o'clock.
Can I use your telephone?
I'd rather just let people talk.
Mum's the word.
Can you handle it?
Did he go there?
Someone stole Tom's money.
We will have to consider each application on a case-by-case basis.
It would be nice to get married.
I appreciate you taking the time to help.
I know the name of this animal.
He gave an excuse about why he had been absent.
I told you I'm not hungry.
I'm freaking out.
I guess it's only a joke.
Her dream is to become a nurse.
You're completely right.
How can you not remember?
Rabbits are extremely social animals.
It's too early to know.
Don't release that dog.
He kept shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
The whole house was shaking.
I was wearing my best clothes.
I don't kiss and tell.
That is very exciting.
He went to art school to study painting and sculpture.
It's started.
He ratted us out.
The president made a statement on the issue.
That's precisely the point.
Meiji was beaten by Keio by a score of three to five.
Tom rubbed his forehead.
We realize that.
Why did you lock the door?
This tastes a lot better than what I usually eat.
That's a bright idea.
She can speak Japanese.
I just want to be your friend.
He plays the guitar well.
I often think about the place where I met you.
He didn't participate in the discussion.
My mother is in the hospital now.
I didn't say you were crazy.
We're inside.
I love the way you talk.
He has overstepped his authority.
The landlord changed the locks.
We don't like our neighbors, and they don't like us, either.
It's a one-time offer.
You have mail.
My grandfather passed away three years ago.
We should lay down a few ground rules before we begin.
I don't feel like watching TV.
Don't lose heart.
Recent advances in medicine are remarkable.
That boy's hair is black.
I took it that you would come.
I'm not really worried.
I don't want to talk anymore.
A good idea suddenly struck her.
Good luck.
Would you like to see my new car?
You could've been hurt.
I am uncertain as to whether I am the right person for the job.
Pass me the salt and pepper, please.
I'm surprised to see you.
I want to know where they are.
You shouldn't stay up so late at night.
They are great friends.
I can't stand all this noise.
I'm in way over my head.
So what are you talking about?
I will have finished the work before you return.
They say he's sick.
I wish to make a complaint.
Mind your own business!
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
She has had the same boyfriend since she was eighteen.
She's a violinist of some renown.
Tom is not available at the moment. May I take a message?
The train stopped because of the storm.
I have an apology to make.
She wriggled her toes.
My little brother is watching TV.
You're very timid.
It's funny.
Proper ID is required.
How could that happen?
I'm not a saint.
Do you know his father?
We don't know her.
I built this for you.
It's too difficult.
Is it worth it or not?
He was always drinking in those days.
He lives in Tokyo.
When I was a child, I used to go to the seashore every summer.
How tall you are!
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.
I didn't make the rules.
God created the heaven and the earth.
I'm sorry, I don't really remember.
I have something in my suitcase for you.
I was caught in a shower and got drenched to the skin.
This book is very small.
You're double-parked.
Where would you like to live?
Tom and Mary have gone.
I still need to talk to you.
I'm going to cook for you.
I'm the only one who can do that.
I'm not joking.
Can you drive me home?
I met her on the way to school.
You're very late.
When was the last time you saw her?
I know you considered me a close friend.
Choose between the two.
They went on vacation together.
That's mine.
The weather is getting worse.
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
I returned the book to the library.
I was in good spirits.
I got you all right where I want you.
No matter how hard you may study, you cannot master English in a year or two.
Yes, I know it.
The export of arms was prohibited.
Do you have any ideas about it?
It's kind of comforting.
"Where's your book?" "On the table."
We discussed a number of options.
I can't think of any other way of getting him to accept our proposal.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I think Tom is following me.
I didn't have to go.
You were drunk last night, weren't you?
Doctors removed the bullet.
How come you're not dead?
You have a great imagination.
We had no trouble.
I think we can do that.
I have to keep trying.
You didn't mean it, did you?
We took refuge in a cave and waited for the storm to pass.
We saw the children enter the room.
Do you have a better idea?
Anybody can make a mistake.
You're welcome.
Without your help, he would fail.
Balls are round.
His wife's a friend of mine.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
They studied the map to find a short cut.
I never thought it would be so exciting.
I can't believe I didn't even think of that.
After breakfast, we went out for a walk.
He was caught by the police.
He is writing a novel.
It's what he painted.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
How much longer do you think it'll be until it starts raining?
He shooed the flies away.
It was very quick.
Shape up or ship out!
It's hard to understand you.
I didn't tell you to sit.
I just want to talk.
Where did you go?
I'm not tired at all.
I hope that's good enough.
Let go of the handle.
I think we were lied to.
You don't want to lose that.
Tom's grandmother looks healthy.
That umbrella is Tom's.
They'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway.
Make it smaller.
You can always quit the job.
She didn't pay back the money.
Soon, it won't be unheard of to live to 150.
The postman was bitten by that dog.
Tom has lived in Boston for more than a year.
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
Pass me the wine, please.
She made the same mistake again.
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
She said, "I owe it to him that I am popular."
What is that?
I'm glad you brought that up.
I've always wanted to meet Tom.
Talk to me!
What does it mean when a girl winks at you?
Tom felt his phone vibrate.
I don't know how I know.
I can't imagine what you've gone through.
I stayed home all day instead of going to work.
I was jealous of you.
Do you really want to know?
She spoke impolitely.
If you can't beat them, join them.
I've been shopping all day.
Tom had his wife Mary followed by a private detective.
He ran away when he saw the policeman.
All are welcomed.
I've tried them all.
I'm not signing anything.
I couldn't do that either.
My father isn't home.
That's a beautiful dress.
I don't think I could live without you.
Sorry I didn't reply sooner.
Green suits you.
The first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.
What floor do you live on?
We found one large footprint and a couple of different size smaller footprints.
What are we all doing?
It seems to be a good house.
No one likes me.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Ask her what she bought.
I always counted you as a friend.
Life has its ups and downs.
If you can't fix the pipe, we'll have to call a plumber.
He lives with his mother.
Tom is familiar with this area.
We must, first of all, be careful of our health.
How long did you stay at the party?
Cows spend hours just chewing their cud.
He was a weak and delicate child.
What did Tom tell Mary not to do?
Who did you talk with?
We talked about everything we could think about.
I don't know how long.
Don't run around in the room.
This is my email address.
It's is so difficult that I have decided to give up trying.
Death is permanent.
What are you punishing them for?
I admire your confidence.
I had never seen him before.
I had to act quickly.
Tell us how we may help you.
How come you're not the boss?
I have three tickets.
You don't have to hurry.
You were hot, weren't you?
Tom never told me why he didn't like Mary.
Can you help her out before they catch her?
I can't believe you've never heard of us.
She helped the old man cross the road.
He didn't show up.
You look very good.
He walked along the shore.
Does he still have that book he borrowed from the library?
Can you tell me the time, please?
This is so boring.
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
Nice to meet you.
Is it your bike?
Something happened.
We're all busy.
I hope we didn't wake you.
Do you have any kind of alibi?
We're both wrong.
Where did you go for spring break?
I must brush up my English.
Things did not go as intended.
He paid the money back.
That's what the boss wants.
Are you envious?
How much time do we have before dinner?
I graduated from Kyoto University.
May I give you some advice?
I belong here.
He gave her a box.
It doesn't bother me if you stay.
Is this building open to the public?
Did Tom swim?
It's gorgeous.
Don't you recognize them?
Do we need to bring our dictionaries to class tomorrow?
It can't hurt you.
I want to eat something.
Her communication skills could be improved.
One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead.
It tastes very good.
Please take more care in the future.
I held on to the rope tightly so I wouldn't fall.
Tom is asleep in his chair.
I hope you'll agree.
I'm not going to call Tom.
Some families spend their vacation near the beach.
I am more than grateful to you for your help.
I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.
There's a way to do it.
When did all this start?
You must not stay in bed.
Tom didn't show up for work yesterday.
I want to do it myself.
I don't handle ultimatums well.
I lowered my meat consumption.
Give Tom back his money.
That will be all for today.
As is usual with him, he arrived a quarter of an hour late.
His criticisms were out of place.
Maybe I should go.
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
This will do for a chair.
Why do you like sports so much?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Try to make good use of your spare time.
How about running?
Just because he likes painting doesn't mean he's good at it.
What are those people doing?
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
The girls fainted.
Tom is in danger, too.
He used the dictionary.
I think you're going to make it.
I think we still have plenty of time.
Go get it.
I'm charmed to meet you.
We're depressed.
I'll be going with you.
I'm so unlucky!
They huddled together.
You're still alive.
Stop screaming in my ears.
Do you want to do this?
Recently we have had several disasters.
I accept your apology.
Are they all nuts?
We need rules.
We agreed to the plan.
This is an option to consider.
I didn't want to do this in the first place.
Without a moment's hesitation, they took drastic action against the conspiracy.
I'm not certain Tom likes that.
Have you ever eaten anything that made you hallucinate?
Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
Are you finished with your work?
Acid acts on metals.
How can you be so callous?
It is very short.
There must be some misunderstanding between us.
I don't want to live alone.
They used truth serum.
Our business is expanding.
You were hurt, weren't you?
We have to attend that meeting whether we like it or not.
Would you mind if I changed seats now?
My parents were proud of me.
I can't believe you would allow this.
Is it credible?
I want to do it tonight.
They won us over with their small-town hospitality.
Yeah, you're right.
Bring it back when you are through.
My name's Tom.
Did you hear all that?
I have read that story in some book.
Look in front of you.
I like mathematics.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
I didn't think it was important.
That feels amazing.
If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you want to live?
We play football every Saturday.
Can I have a word with Tom in private?
Get me the evidence.
Mary really is a very cute girl.
Maybe you can help us.
That job is impossible for me to do.
Tom is wearing a black tie.
We should get married.
He's about to leave.
I lay in bed thinking about everything that had happened that day.
Isn't that your dictionary?
Tom didn't laugh.
There's been a significant development in the case of the missing toddler.
Give me the money.
Can I open the windows?
Tom ordered Mary to do it.
Nobody knows.
Large catches of squid are a sign of a coming earthquake.
I looked up all the words I didn't know in the dictionary.
Sooner or later, I'll probably visit Boston.
Which do you like better, spring or autumn?
She quit school for health reasons.
Tom can't see Mary from where he is.
I will return the book as soon as I can.
Let's get back to work.
I confiscated it.
I am on good terms with him.
Are you sure we've never met before?
One's new. The other's old.
She has no shame.
Don't open the door for anybody.
I knew I'd get blamed eventually.
He had scarcely escaped when he was recaptured.
I'll pay for lunch.
I love this game.
Did you have fun last night?
Why not just quit?
This house is famous.
She has the same bag as you have.
I'm not sure I follow what you're saying.
I think Tom could be persuaded to help.
Let's take care of business.
You're not young anymore.
I think you knew my father.
She is very popular among the boys.
The investigation is under way.
Some were farmers, some were hunters.
Can you catch the chicken?
I forgot to bring the map.
Is your daughter here?
What happens next?
He reached the rank of general.
Don't you think you ought to write them a thank-you note?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I didn't mean to offend you.
He lives in an enormous house.
I don't know what to call you.
Is your new computer working well?
Don't worry. We're safe here.
You could do it if you really wanted to.
I've got to speak to you.
I'm Canadian, too.
Would you like to know how I did that?
Doing it that way will take a long time.
I'll fix it now.
I suggest you leave immediately.
She and I are brother and sister.
I slept the rest of the day.
We sat in lawn chairs and stared at the mountain.
You probably won't like it.
I want that cat.
It scared me.
The letter was wrongly addressed.
They asserted that it was true.
Up until now, they've been good neighbors.
Were you excited?
It is their right to vote.
I'm fed up with all their lies.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
They visited us.
I wish it was Valentine's Day!
Please say hello to your family.
I have seen it a lot.
I'm a good cook.
There is nothing as important as friendship.
Let me get this straight.
He's smart.
They love that song.
Don't worry about your dog. I'll take care of him.
No one can tell.
He went to the library.
I thought I was going crazy.
He told me about the accident.
Tom never forgave himself for that.
Don't put the wallet on the top of the heater.
Did you put it somewhere?
I think it's time for me to get a dog.
There will be an energy crisis in the near future.
I'm pretty hungry since I haven't eaten since early this morning.
English is not easy for me.
We've got to find Tom.
We must decide.
That's classified.
I guess we're both going to die.
That's close enough.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
It's unlike him to get so angry.
Tom found out our secret.
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
Is there a photo shop in the hotel?
She plays tennis after school.
Tom is always late to meetings.
Why are you so tired today?
He's a bigot.
Where do you live?
Have you ever ridden in a hot air balloon?
Don't forget to send that letter.
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.
She has ten children.
Her son is sure to succeed.
After breakfast, we went for a walk.
I appreciate your support.
Clerks with sticky fingers won't keep their jobs for long.
Would you have asked me this question if I had been a man?
Tom saw Mary crying.
Who was there that night?
You are probably wrong.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
You're stuck.
No one was there.
All the villagers know of the accident.
He makes everybody feel at ease.
Please be polite.
Have you ever uploaded a video to YouTube?
How did you come up with that answer?
Do you have any kind of alibi?
The movie is now showing at a theater near you.
What did it feel like?
I want to eat something good.
Bring it back when you're done.
She was equal to the job.
Do your best in everything.
My mother passed away recently.
Tom has a bright career as a medical doctor.
Did someone follow us here?
Lemons are sour.
May I talk to you?
Something's not right here.
I think you're drunk.
I wasn't serious.
Photography is an expensive hobby.
It is, even now, a book loved by men and women alike.
I had the boy carry my bag.
You've suffered enough.
They're headed this way.
Tom fired Mary.
You're so pretty.
He was eager for news.
I wonder what's going to happen to us.
She told him to rewrite his resume.
You should've told Tom that a long time ago.
I'm meditating.
We drank some wine.
I think they like you.
He is very particular about his food.
Do you know who he was?
I read it to my family.
I sort of understand.
Tom looked at his reflection in the mirror.
I'm trying to sleep.
Let's help him so that he will succeed.
My daughter studies in that school.
May I join you?
My boss is very cheerful today.
I think I still have time for another cup of coffee.
You're not bruised.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
Stop acting like a child.
He seems honest.
If it rains, he won't come.
Everything matters.
I have lots of time.
I don't know what else I can say.
You must stick to your diet.
She was advised by him to go abroad while she was still young.
Tom doesn't have enough friends.
You pay me very well.
I don't hate you.
Without you, I am nothing.
They said no.
He fell in love with a younger woman.
Three were wounded.
We couldn't understand her logic.
What kind of person do you think I am?
How can you fix it?
Are those guys your friends?
I'm afraid of death.
I just don't want to go with you.
My wife looked surprised.
They tried to cheer me up.
Could you turn it down?
I already said yes.
The mother occasionally reread her son's letter.
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
You don't have to apologize.
Tom knew he had a problem.
I'm an extremely humble person.
What exactly happened?
When are you coming to the Netherlands?
I have something in my suitcase for you.
We need to get out of here.
It was light enough.
It was a shock to hear about Tom's divorce.
Why wouldn't you go out with him?
This car is very expensive.
I want to make you smile.
Workaholics view holidays as a waste of time.
I can't keep living the way I've been living.
Just don't get involved, OK?
He departed for London the day before yesterday.
Better him than me.
Cocaine is a drug.
I don't plan on telling you anything.
Don't you miss your father?
It wasn't that big.
Is there anything else you can tell us that might help?
I'm going to bed.
His work is washing cars.
They're out of town.
He's cleaning his rifle.
Congress asked for more information.
You're stupid to trust him.
He couldn't fulfill the promise he made to his father.
Did you see the sunrise earlier? It was really beautiful.
I will never forgive you.
His bicycle is different from this one.
Nobody can get along with such a person.
I brushed my hair.
There must be some misunderstanding.
May I look at the menu?
She explained to him why she was late.
You're the oldest.
Were you nervous during the job interview?
I feel really proud.
He has been secretly in love with her.
They won't have arrived yet.
I got it for free.
She did not come until two.
Your bicycle is better than mine.
He can be counted on.
He has no common sense.
Don't act like you don't know how to dance.
I'd like to book a table for four for tomorrow night.
She fainted.
We drank all night.
I don't know what I'm going to do next.
The children got lost in the woods.
There are many people who don't like me.
Tom intends to change that.
I usually don't bother with people like him.
Apparently, the murder happened in a locked room.
Have you been drinking?
Are you American?
Will you try this on for me?
I got fined.
I'm not a professional.
Can you describe the situation you were in?
I sure appreciate all your help.
I know the photographer who took this picture.
I arrived yesterday.
Tom made his way through the crowd.
A horse can run very fast.
She hit me on the head with a hammer.
The plants were damaged by the frost.
Everything is set.
Now, it's time to celebrate.
What is the total amount of money you spent?
Tom didn't have the courage to disobey Mary.
The house has burnt down.
All I want is for you to be happy.
Tom is better than me at math.
It's my favorite food.
Unfortunately, I already have plans for that day.
He plays poker with them.
I would like to drink something.
My parents have kicked me out of the house.
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
His story turned out to be false.
Never do anything just to show you can.
The minister approved the building plans.
Do you like dogs?
Stop calling me Tom.
Are you a cop or something?
You left your lights on.
I don't know who these people are.
If you have a question, please raise your right hand.
I was too astonished to speak.
What did they hit you with?
All our members are volunteers.
Is this love?
You can't know that for sure.
He changed his job.
Do you like cooking?
I raise orchids.
We want to hear it.
I touched the bottom.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
I wouldn't mind doing it again.
Let's not fight.
I advised him to come back at once.
I don't have your wit.
I want the same jacket as you are wearing.
That dress fit her perfectly.
I already told you he isn't here.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'd like to ask you about a student of yours.
Though wounded, they continued to fight.
The region is relatively rich in mineral resources.
Lock the door.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
Tom eventually joined the navy.
I'm confused enough as it is.
England was invaded by the Danes.
He's intelligent.
I thought I heard you.
He asked me a few questions.
She greeted him cheerfully as she always did.
He knows many folk dances.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
He had a rough childhood.
You'll need a temporary bridge.
I decided to take his side against the others.
He had been working in the factory for three years when the accident occurred.
Why are you looking at me?
This flower is yellow and the others are blue.
Hot lemon with honey is a good remedy for colds.
Should I wait for you tomorrow in front of the opera house?
Do it this way.
It's been raining for almost a week.
Will you eat dinner?
We're almost there.
I got up earlier than usual to catch the first train.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
She has the air of being a lady.
I appreciate you coming here.
She plays the violin very well.
What's your biggest fear?
They went to the zoo.
He drank straight from the bottle.
The clock says two.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Without you, I would've died.
Bread is made from flour, water and yeast.
There's been a lot of activity around the office this morning.
They were scolded by the teacher.
The door opened.
Were you excited?
I got upset.
Turn it off.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
They were taken prisoner.
I am now in an old castle.
We all had a good time.
Would you mind if I borrowed this?
Tom could've hurt himself today.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
Everyone started arguing.
That's true.
How did you find us?
Do you want a drink or not?
Can you make it go any faster?
The pickpocket disappeared into the crowd.
Would you like to switch seats?
I go to any party I am invited to.
This is how I did it.
Get a doctor.
I worked as hard as I could so I didn't fail.
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
The soldier was wounded in the leg.
He paid 1,000 yen for this book.
You will be able to read this book next year.
Do you mind much?
Ever since she fell in the kitchen, she hasn't been all there.
She will come even if she is tired.
Farmers always complain about the weather.
She stole my clothes!
I often catch colds.
My credit cards are maxed out.
Tom took another bite.
He led his men and horses over snowy mountains and down into hot valleys.
He was left all alone in the woods.
He told the students to be quiet.
I didn't vote.
Why didn't you guys tell me?
We are Australians.
Should we run for it?
You shouldn't have done it.
They climbed down the tree.
Your guess is almost right.
It was not easy to get a lot of money in a short time.
This is ugly.
You are old enough to know better than to act like that.
Where's the checkout counter?
How many were there altogether?
Did you watch the game?
Have you ever lived in Boston?
I answered your questions. Now let me ask you a few.
That's a low blow.
She warmed herself by the fire.
I may not get another chance.
I have no place to sleep tonight.
Give it back to him.
Tom likes living in Boston.
She speaks a little Arabic.
We're so proud of you!
You have a lovely daughter.
I was as surprised as you.
Tom remained unmarried all his life.
You didn't get very far.
I feel like going on a trip.
This river is the widest in Europe.
He left the room as soon as I entered it.
I trusted my teacher.
Why can't we just go home?
Look at that picture.
He received a sizable advance for his book.
Can I see you a moment?
I like chess.
I haven't gotten paid yet.
Hold the elevator, Tom.
She has a funny face.
He's afraid of making mistakes.
Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
You can't escape from reality.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
There is no reason for her to scold you.

The train was ten minutes behind time.
It's rumored that they are going to get married.
Can we say no to the USA?
The twins look exactly alike.
I'm touched.
There should be more national hospitals for old people.
It is certain that he is wrong.
You cannot achieve anything without effort.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Do you have a flashlight I can borrow?
We felt good.
So what is it you want me to do?
You may not like it.
What a team!
I owe you a breakfast.
Who's playing hockey tonight?
There was nothing I could've done.
One is never too old to learn.
He turned to his friend for help.
They have been married for four years.
Put your valuables in the safe.
The body converts extra calories into fat.
Does Tom like his job?
Admission was free.
I had no idea you were so young.
Thousands of people gathered there.
I'll try to fix it later.
That's where I work.
They looked very happy.
He lost a fortune in the stock market.
They'll never make it.
I didn't know you then.
Love is not enough.
She is as beautiful as ever.
You gotta get more organized.
Let's get the party going.
I think this is a bad idea.
Do you need me to repeat the question?
I'm ready!
It's a huge responsibility.
Have you ever been on TV?
Could you make a reservation for me?
That's why I have to do this.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
You said you were happy.
I'll give you to the count of three.
You should never cut corners on safety.
He asked her where she lived.
When did you go to bed last night?
I think things will get better.
We're alone here.
All those books are mine.
How many letters are there in the English alphabet?
I've been misunderstood.
I was hurt by many people.
I told my mom I was gay and it didn't faze her at all.
She stared at me.
I'd like to come along.
I'm not one to gossip.
Tom has been very cooperative.
If you have any doubts, let me know without any hesitation.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
I'll get it.
You despise me, don't you?
Make a sketch of your house.
I thought you did fairly well.
That's upsetting.
The snow was several meters deep.
You're smarter than me.
We have dinner at seven.
She made cookies for the children.
The light is changing from red to green.
He was looking at the sky.
I am beginning to understand.
He always borrows money from me.
I don't recall asking for your advice.
Is that your house?
She went upstairs.
I heard him go down the stairs.
I think perhaps you're right.
I'm familiar with such things.
You're taking advantage of her weakness.
Since he has ambitions, he works hard.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Tom is in his room, writing a letter to his grandmother.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
We're very grateful.
He always gets home at six o'clock in the evening.
What are your plans for the weekend?
They broke out into spontaneous laughter.
I have a ton of work to do today.
I just feel so helpless.
I guess we should go get something to eat.
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
The elevator is out of order.
There she comes.
He isn't my cousin.
How about a snack?
I think that he's probably not a bad boy.
Tom watched Mary dance.
Do you have a shoehorn?
I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
I think there's something wrong.
This information checks out all right.
How tall you are!
She saw him driving his new car.
That's not the issue.
You should do that.
We're friends from way back.
What's its name?
Birch trees have white bark.
Against the snow, the white rabbit was invisible.
Have a nice weekend.
I'm not that fast.
I'll always be there for you.
Do you know how many people died in yesterday's plane crash?
Tom explained the decision.
Wow!
I enjoy eating with you.
I believed you.
He did it for the money.
Try on this sweater.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
I feel better now.
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston.
He is a physicist.
Let's start after he comes home.
We went on a picnic together.
It cost a lot of money to repair the car.
Let's be clear.
Tell me what you see.
All the inmates are present and accounted for.
She was crying with pain.
She apologized for having offended him.
He is a fast speaker.
May I sit next to you?
I had forgotten all about today's meeting. I'm glad you reminded me.
What's in that bottle?
I hit the jackpot.
I am able to drive a car.
She finally managed to get a hold of her old friend.
Was there a lot of traffic?
We're quitting.
We came back to camp before dark.
We're looking for some computer-savvy people to work for us.
He entered the room on tiptoes.
The traffic accident deprived the young man of his sight.
I felt a little dizzy.
This is not the first time this has happened.
You should not go alone.
She risked her life to protect her child.
I saw a fly on the ceiling.
Would you teach me?
Don't worry. We're safe here.
I don't remember her name anymore.
I said he could go.
Give me two minutes.
Is this your family?
I see how dangerous it is.
I thought you wanted the truth.
Go back to your room.
The talks will last three days.
He won't live much longer.
I just want you to be happy.
The revolution divided many families.
Instead of cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
Ask me anything you like.
This is not Disneyland.
The goods arrive by sea.
The housing situation shows no hope of improvement.
Have you told your mom?
He started to learn Spanish from the radio.
I let them go.
She herself helped him because no one else would.
I'll do anything you wish.
It is almost impossible to learn a foreign language in a short time.
I slept nine hours.
Somebody laughed.
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
"May I join you?" "Why not?"
I don't want to waste my time trying to do this again.
I don't have time to talk to you now.
He is a writer.
I've had a good sleep.
What makes you think I'm not happy?
She surprised him with a kiss.
A child needs a mother.
I can't tell you how much your support means to us.
Tom did it with the best of intentions.
I have been to London.
That is a mistake.
I should go with you.
See you around.
You can't smoke in here.
I know they'll all want to help you.
Do you want to say goodbye?
I have a better idea.
I bought a new sewing machine.
He touched my hand.
Whose glasses are these?
The red hat goes well with her dress.
What is your specialty?
She couldn't convince him to accept a personal check.
We only kissed.
We'll stay out of your way.
Let's try to win every game.
We're out of milk.
Why are you cursing?
We got ready.
Please hand in the necessary papers.
Sorry, I can't help you.
I want to see a doctor about my stomachache.
What has become of her son?
God sent a sign.
She has always done her best to make their life easier.
He held the trophy up high.
Get me something to eat.
We've been busy.
I'd like you to have dinner with me.
Is it any good?
I wore a coat so I wouldn't catch a cold.
That's not important for you to know.
I don't read newspapers much.
Are we allowed to use the elevator?
Don't believe anything they say.
She forced him to do it.
We're the good guys.
Tom wants a beer.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Let's get the party started.
It's a good rule.
When did you start writing songs?
The students are sitting in a circle.
Don't cut down those trees.
He is about my age.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Proceed with caution.
Everybody does stupid stuff like that in high school.
That's it. I've done all I can do.
If only I'd hadn't stayed so long!
I don't care if you go or not. I'm going anyway.
How did you get out of your room?
I know what you are thinking.
Has Tom become crazy?
"Who is it?" "It's me."
Do you have any questions?
I don't like classical music.
Everywhere he stopped, the people welcomed him warmly.
I just can't do that here.
I don't know what happened.
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
My grandmother has become old.
It's unlikely that our team will win.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
He is a recognized authority on the subject.
Is Tom always like this?
We can't hold the enemy off much longer.
Did you close the window?
This is absurd.
I'm smarter than you.
I'd love to know if my luggage is arriving soon.
I'm too old for Tom.
I had a strange dream last night.
I think Tom can help.
How's your project coming along?
You drive.
The dragonfly was skimming across the water.
Colds are prevalent this winter.
I didn't understand what was happening.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
Where will we eat breakfast today?
He didn't give me much advice.
Many great thinkers who were unknown while alive became famous after death.
I suddenly became dizzy.
We tried to cheer him up.
Who knows what you'll find up in the attic?
I'm done with you.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
I watched TV after I washed the dishes.
I wish I could sing like Tom.
I find it difficult to express my meaning in words.
I feel like I'm making progress.
This book is really interesting.
You have a choice of black tea, coffee, or milk.
What in the world are you doing?
It'll happen, I'm sure of it.
No matter what he says, don't trust him.
It is time to shut the gate.
It's already past your bedtime.
Leave my house.
What kind of places would you like to see?
Add two ounces of grated cheese.
It's not us.
Almost everyone arrived on time.
Don't be disgusting.
Why are you so angry?
Call me right back.
Did you enjoy your holiday?
An actor has to memorize his lines.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
Thank you for helping me write my resume.
I thought we had a great relationship.
He is something of a musician.
The tip of the spear was dipped in a deadly poison.
I want to talk with you.
Hang on tight!
They have black hair.
This is everything I've ever wanted.
You'll soon get used to speaking in public.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
You want me to do your dirty work for you, don't you?
He seemed to like that.
Tom's body has been cremated.
We should use the fireplace tonight.
You're very busy.
I suggested that we go fishing.
We're bored.
I had a chance to travel abroad.
Mary didn't wear any jewelry.
They went crazy.
Can you give me a ride to the office on Wednesday?
The Amazon is fed by a large number of tributaries.
I made you coffee.
Tom knows that.
I'm not sure I like this.
Tom doesn't use sunscreen.
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
How do you want me to do that?
It's a serious illness.
Have you fed the dog?
He broke his arm playing soccer.
She stared him in the face.
I don't appreciate being interrupted.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
Tom knew deep down that it was all his fault, but he wasn't about to admit it.
I deserve better.
Come with us.
I want to take you to dinner.
Please refer to paragraph ten.
He continued singing.
I was impolite.
Don't give up without a fight.
She's still a minor.
This looks longer than that, but it is an optical illusion.
Both of my sisters are not married.
Tom is a really cool guy.
How much is your hourly pay?
Used car salesmen are a disreputable bunch.
This building is ancient.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Tom was able to do what the rest of us weren't able to do.
I could really make things hard for you, you know.
She made him rich.
The constant border wars between England and Scotland came to an end.
When does the rainy season in Japan begin?
The statue has no head.
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be homeless.
He's always complaining about something.
Are you ready to party?
I've been looking all over for you.
Don't get fat.
We don't have any eggs left either.
Did you know this was coming down?
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
We can depend on her to help us.
I just feel so helpless.
Do you have some wine?
He went by bicycle.
I'm proud of my father being a good cook.
We're both witnesses.
Please don't let this happen again.
It keeps you on your toes.
I heard that there were alligators in the sewers.
Go have some fun.
I feel ready.
He is lazy.
I hate math most of all.
Wait a while.
He doesn't remember anything.
Tom told me a lot about you.
I can't thank you enough for the help you've given me.
He keeps making the same mistake.
Tom goes jogging in the park every morning.
I prefer dogs.
She is, indeed, a lovely girl.
Please circle the right answer.
I never thought I'd get that lucky.
He was eager to return to school in September.
I don't remember anything happening.
Those are your options.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
Are you afraid of getting hurt?
The moon has come out.
It's important that I be informed immediately.
I would advise against it.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
My father doesn't drink hard liquor.
The problem will eventually solve itself.
He bought the land for the purpose of building a house on it.
I'm always proud of my family.
How many classes do you have on Mondays?
A monument was erected in memory of the deceased.
He went out the window.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Bartender, I'd like to have a drink.
Father comes home from work about nine in the evening.
Several bridges have been damaged or swept away.
Does your dog bite?
I have a place to sleep.
His heart is broken.
Will you entertain the guests while I get dressed?
We could see enemy ships on the horizon.
I know that better than anybody.
I made sure no one was following me.
What color is your hair?
I inherited his estate.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
I have to answer the phone.
How about going to the movie?
I have some news for you.
How can I make a telephone call to Japan?
All swans are white.
She hates country music.
You're very timid.
It's forbidden.
Come and see me whenever you like.
There's a new sheriff in town.
I'd like to talk with you.
Didn't that seem odd to you?
Two seats remained vacant.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
Why did you come early?
The man you saw yesterday was my uncle.
Is there someone with you?
I only have fifty meters of rope.
Tom must've been surprised.
My father bought me a bicycle.
You're not the first.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere before.
Manuela's clothes are very stylish.
I truly apologize.
She became a true friend of mine.
Your approval is not required.
We'd better leave him alone.
You were drunk, weren't you?
She became a singer.
At the time of the accident, almost all of the passengers on the bus were sleeping.
Let's see what happens this time.
Who moved the furniture?
The water is clean.
I'll be back at ten.
She insisted on my going there.
I couldn't remember the title of that song.
Tom wanted to be a better teacher.
Can you account for your absence last Friday?
I can protect you.
Your shipment should be delivered within twenty four hours.
I stopped smoking.
I'm not done.
Would you like to go for a walk?
What's going to be different?
I'm reporting for duty.
See to it that this problem gets fixed by tomorrow.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
What's its name?
I want to go right now.
All men have equal rights.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
He ignored his father's advice.
Do you have a pen?
Keep searching.
Are you up for it?
You've put on weight, haven't you?
You're obviously in great shape.
Look it up in your dictionary.
Who are you all?
I really don't have the time.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
Don't think about it.
Isn't this wonderful?
We don't need you anymore.
We must try to break the deadlock.
I'm not wearing socks.
Get me the details.
It only takes a few minutes.
She asked him if he knew where I lived.
I had a lot of fun last weekend.
He was born poor, but died a millionaire.
It is getting warmer day by day.
Tom ate some spoiled food and became sick.
You're not alone anymore.
I don't expect you'd remember.
He drank three glasses of water.
Eat whatever food you like.
A cucumber is related to a watermelon.
I don't like this game.
You're really incredible.
Let's see if that works.
I began to doubt the accuracy of his statement.
It has become noticeably colder.
This is where I was born.
Where did you stay?
He will not agree with us.
I swim almost every day.
He gave me authority to fire them.
It is useless to go on strike now.
Are you aware of any problems?
Those flowers are beautiful.
You almost died.
You won't be fired.
How have you been getting along lately?
I found the picture you were looking for.
She asked the police for protection.
That's what she said.
Mother has been sick since last Thursday.
He wakes up early.
I really regret doing that.
I'd like to be woken up tomorrow at 6:30.
You don't seem very satisfied.
I am dying to see her again.
I'd like to make a call to Tokyo, Japan. The number is 3202-5625.
He gave me an apple.
I find you attractive.
It's easier this way.
I'm untalented.
Let's come back to it later.
I went on reading.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
Regardless what he does, he does it well.
He looks confused.
Tom doesn't want to talk to you now.
He canceled the appointment at the last moment.
They huddled together.
I hear he is good at mahjong.
I'll do whatever you want.
Tom folded his sheets.
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona.
They were naive.
I'm not in the mood for jokes.
Are you sure that's safe?
I don't think you really want to know.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
Watch out for thieves around here.
I'm not talking to you, Tom.
I think you're wrong.
Tom showed Mary something.
Tom will fix it.
My figures don't seem to tally with yours.
I know where they're taking Tom.
It is not good to eat between meals.
The tide is rising fast.
I've known her since I was little.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
I'm not like most people.
What was I to do?
We had better not mention it.
Your argument is not any more convincing than that of my stubborn father.
I'm just looking.
I hope he will come up with a new and good idea.
Do I have to do it right away?
I'm sorry about last night.
How's your morning been?
The hat costs less than the coat.
Women were given the right to vote.
You probably won't like it.
Is that illegal?
Those old laws were all done away with.
It doesn't mean anything!
I want you back today.
She advised him to go to the police station, but he was afraid to.
Make it quick.
Does anyone else use your account?
How did you come by this painting?
What's become of your dog?
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
I shouldn't have to ever come back here.
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing.
I bid against him.
I know that things haven't been easy for you.
The population of this village had decreased.
They want peace.
I've been looking all over for you.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
I don't want to think about it.
Tom seems to be unable to interact normally with other people.
He pulled my shirt.
I love Christmas songs.
Add a little sugar and cream.
This is private.
I thought you were injured.
I immediately recognized them and so did Tom.
No one responded.
We're retiring.
I want to ask you one simple question.
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
She walks.
What's your favorite free software application?
He stuck with his own theory.
Please tell us about your family.
Actually, I did want to ask you one thing.
How much did they give you for your old car?
The door will be painted tomorrow.
It's for my science project.
You're really annoying.
Go away!
Have you written your report?
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
Why do you not believe in God?
This year, Valentine's Day falls on a Thursday.
You're not that old, Tom.
That's all you can do.
He's a jerk.
Are you dating anyone?
I suggested that she go alone.
I'm not old.
Go ahead, try it now.
He built a new house.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
Are you mentally ill?
I was afraid of that.
Do you prefer subtitled or dubbed TV shows?
The noise got on my nerves.
It was getting louder and louder.
Don't be afraid to make mistakes when speaking English.
Everyone is drunk.
You are taller than me.
We'll just have to wait and see how things pan out.
I don't need you to wait for me.
They all have drinks.
We don't want anybody to find out.
The lights went out.
She had twins.
Let's be best friends forever.
How did you come to hear that?
Tom sounds exhausted.
You're very understanding.
Do you remember anything else?
Try to remain calm.
What are you afraid of?
Don't you think it might be a bit too expensive for us to buy?
I'll stand by you in time of need.
I hate karaoke.
Are you young?
Tell me the truth.
Today's special is fish.
We were very sorry we couldn't help them.
Where are you all going?
I admire your bravery.
The vote is unanimous.
Will you help me clean the room?
Tom has a friend whose mother is a veterinarian.
He has a good accent.
I just got a little carried away.
I know you don't trust us.
I recommend we keep our distance.
How many categories are there?
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Whose phone is that?
He was drunk and angry.
Tom is frustrated.
The doctor advised him to stop working too much.
I was taken advantage of.
Do you like surprises?
Anybody can make a mistake.
Please come on time.
We've got company.
Tom has only one leg.
You have only to ask for it.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
Her mother is a wonderful pianist.
We're going to have to work together.
The town was destroyed by the flood after the storm.
How much is your hourly pay?
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
Where can we get what we want?
Just be glad you're OK.
My parent's house is comfortable.
I didn't catch what he said.
I'm sick of this hot weather.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
Bring me a moist towel.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
May I pay by check?
I know you must be afraid.
I had something else on my mind.
Call if you need me.
I'm not prepared to do that yet.
You have no choice.
Do you know anyone here?
I'll give you a hand.
She went to see him the other day.
Can he see me?
I want you to wait for me.
She is a child after all.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
I can lend you one if you want.
I can't stand her jealousy.
Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school tomorrow morning.
You won't be fired.
I'm not in a position to discuss that.
Take what you need.
How can you tell good English from bad English?
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
Tom was very tired.
I think it's time for me to change my plans.
He who laughs last, laughs best.
They found the room empty.
I have my own theory.
Let us never speak of it again.
Won't you come to my house next Sunday?
Don't bother waking me up at 4:00 a.m. I don't plan to go fishing tomorrow.
She can naturally speak English.
You warned me, but I didn't listen.
Is there something you wanted to say?
I could see it was you.
That's a good picture of you.
Let me know how it goes.
He will never make it.
I have two cousins.
It won't cost you a dime.
Choose any of these pens.
The sidewalk was covered with fallen leaves.
Your father's friends aren't his only supporters.
Is all this necessary?
I thought we had an understanding.
You hurt me.
This tooth is loose.
Don't look back.
Any teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.
It will be winter before long.
I was more than a little embarrassed.
It sounds as if the government doesn't know what to do.
What he said made us angry.
You don't seem so smart.
I love it here.
He likes games of chance.
I need it today.
I'm an actress, not a model.
Cut it out.
He solved all those problems with ease.
I didn't see you.
I wanted to thank you for what you did today.
He denied having been involved in the affair.
I think we need to find out why Tom wasn't here yesterday.
He behaved himself like a man.
I was asleep.
I'll go get us something to eat.
Please contact me by mail.
Did she show you the picture?
She is gaining weight.
I just thought you might want to go skiing with us.
She urged him to consider the request.
My dream is to become a teacher.
I must be leaving now.
Why don't we take a taxi?
Get your mother.
We live in peace.
I don't deserve this.
Once again.
Is anyone absent today?
Don't forget to bring your umbrella in case it rains.
Show me the way, please.
I can't explain what happened.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
How can you know that?
He was not able to marry her.
There's a yellow rose.
She speaks English really well.
I want you to help me clean it up.
Tom's glad.
You were very busy, weren't you?
She has very good manners.
Does Tom know what happened?
Those books are always in great demand.
If I tell him the truth, she will never forgive me.
Don't even bother coming.
This question is not easy.
Tom disappeared.
We're still involved.
I have neither seen nor heard of such a thing.
The water was blue.
It is too hot to work.
Here's your drink.
Don't shoot.
Don't forget that she's a woman.
Did she say it?
The rebels sabotaged the railroad.
Please say hello to her.
That sound is annoying.
Let's review the evidence.
I had help.
Did you see the show?
Do you want to tell me what this is?
He became a pianist.
Could you be more specific?
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
You must go.
If only you'd thought of that before shooting your big mouth off.
He will regret this.
Do you think this is some kind of game?
Could you turn off the TV?
I had my doubts about whether that was the right choice.
The camera will cost at least $500.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
I'm not hurt.
I used to believe everything you said.
I'd help if I could.
How long did you stay at the party?
We will be together forever.
Elephants live in Asia and Africa.
I can do better than this.
I thought he was rich.
I've heard the rumor.
Tom told Mary where he hid the gold coins.
The pain started last night.
Who left this mess in the toilet?
If we leave now, we should make it.
They're stalling.
Why would you want to do a thing like that?
I know people.
I put it in your room.
He's not in our group.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth.
How do they seem to you?
A little knowledge of Spanish will go a long way toward making your trip to Mexico enjoyable.
You can run, but you can't hide.
I'm wondering whether to take on that job.
Tom gave me this watch.
We're in sync.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
Are you in a bad mood or something?
She must be well off.
He was visibly bothered.
He has a drug allergy.
I want your opinion.
I want back what you've taken from me.
He finds pleasure in watching people.
I wish Tom could've come to my concert.
The war between the two countries ended with a big loss for both sides.
Tom has a surprise for you.
I was born in 1972.
I thought you might like some hot coffee.
Everyone's laughing at us.
One of the children left the door open.
My tie is orange.
May I turn off the lights?
You're all happy.
Is everything all right at home?
Tom is the person I saw yesterday.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
Why's it so hot in here?
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
After reflecting on my life up to now, I decided that I needed to change my goals.
I went home.
You're just the man I want to see.
I had some fun.
What was I saying?
That is an old camera.
I'll show my album to you.
No one believed me.
Her late husband was a violinist.
My neighbor's son made fun of my daughter today at school.
I can't say I'm shocked.
My hands are stained with paint.
I didn't know anything.
He's my friend. Do you know him?
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Pay attention to what he says.
I'll stand by you no matter what happens.
I'm not entirely sure.
How do you account for that?
I won't forget.
I brought you another blanket.
You should have a doctor examine your condition.
I'll do all the talking.
Am I under suspicion?
Coffee, please.
I was born in 1988 in York.
Since it rained, I did not go.
I just thought you were happy.
A contagious disease descended on the town.
Why was I turned down for the job?
The two girls wore the same dress to the dance.
I really didn't mean for this to happen.
Half a million children still face malnutrition in Niger.
I would like some envelopes.
Will you put the dishes away in the cupboard?
I don't see much choice.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
It's easier to spend a lot than to save a little.
Tom is making tea.
We were talking to each other all the time.
Please turn on the television.
He's very protective.
I try.
He admitted his defeat.
They rejected our idea.
Why do you say one thing, and then go and do another?
I need to know.
He wiped the sweat off his face.
I just wanted to go to college.
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
What did Tom offer you?
There were a lot of people in the park.
It's hard to tell.
I can't believe we've never done this before.
They were afraid of being overheard.
I know you're upset.
The outdoor concert was canceled due to the storm.
They had no money left.
He won a gold medal.
He lived a happy life.
You were drunk, weren't you?
You look nice with your hair short.
I went straight to bed.
This is so easy.
I shouldn't have sent that email.
I handed him a map.
Who is your brother?
We're overreacting.
I'm friends with all those guys.
I loved going to the beach.
He usually goes to work at 8 a.m.
I went to sleep as soon as I got home.
Tom hugged Mary.
I'll take care of you all.
I'm glad I invited you.
Do you have a fever?
I stayed at a nice hotel.
I'm sorry, my mother's not at home.
I really enjoyed that.
It is good for your health to take a walk every morning.
I don't trust many people.
Give me what you have in your hand.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
I didn't apologize.
They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
I want to talk to you about this report.
This experience will be invaluable as a way of improving the way I study English.
Tom never knew Mary was rich.
He doesn't want to play with his toys.
Time heals all wounds.
Where will you have lunch today?
I want you to listen carefully.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
How late do you stay open?
Your plan seems excellent.
Smoking and drinking aren't allowed.
It is snowing.
I'm not ugly.
He had the last laugh.
If you want to succeed, you should work hard.
He gave me a smile of recognition.
Tell me why she is crying.
Can I see you at ten tomorrow?
Did Tom find it?
I think we'll get there before noon.
He had just finished his homework when the clock struck ten.
All of us like you very much.
I shook hands with Tom.
What do you advise me to do?
Juggling is actually a lot easier than it looks.
Don't talk to me!
Tom is an excellent marksman.
You can listen to audio files by native speakers on our website.
She told him that she had seen me there last week.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
The lid is closed.
You're very good.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
Do you think I should go alone?
I said stay back.
Give me my drink.
I've got to get to the airport.
I'm bored right now.
They should have one.
I caught it.
I want to try something new.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
I'd rather do this without your help.
How about you?
You're biased.
What's the most important part of a good education?
I think that's very clear.
Do you want to talk?
Whose bicycle is this?
How hungry are you?
Words failed him.
Tom didn't have to do this.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Do you have a cellphone?
All I wanted was a little more attention.
Tell me where she lives.
We worry about your future.
You're not wanted here.
I think it won't rain this afternoon.
You shouldn't be in here.
Tom took off his shirt.
He's a regular at the bars and pubs around here.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Stop yelling.
I have my own room.
There are more girls than boys in this school.
You should've taken his advice.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
You were hurt, weren't you?
How far are you prepared to go?
She is related to him by marriage.
Hop in.
She is not to blame.
I didn't want anything.
We meant no harm.
Are you almost ready?
He is a compulsive gambler.
What are you crunching on?
I didn't even see you once last year.
She got me a tiny toy.
You'll be all right.
I'm very modest.
He has a grip of steel.
Are you bringing your camera?
He takes the attitude that resistance is a waste of energy.
He is anything but a gentleman.
You're doing it right.
You don't have a clue.
Tom and I went there on our honeymoon.
What is wrong with you people?
You're cantankerous.
What you're doing makes me nervous.
We're very happy.
Stop bugging me. I’m busy.
I thought we had an agreement.
I'm fed up with English.
Tom is the person who helped Mary.
Thoughts are expressed by means of words.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I fell in the pool.
I gave him my address.
I don't want to buy this kind of sofa.
It's a gross distortion of the truth.
I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.
I am poor at tennis.
This is your fate.
I felt cheated.
It was a big help for me.
This noise is annoying.
I go to bed early at night.
I do not like both of them.
I don't feel like doing it.
Milk does not agree with me.
Our allies are weak.
I still think Tom is hiding something.
I don't want you to get the wrong impression.
Keep your eyes on the road.
I carried the heavy bag on my back.
This house is abandoned.
His speech went on for such a long time that some people began to fall asleep.
My shirt isn't dry yet.
How did you manage to escape?
You could be one of them.
Since he was feeling sick, he stayed home from school.
Get out of my kitchen.
He collected various information.
Did you use my camera?
She wiped her face with a handkerchief.
I am telling a story.
We need not have hurried.
He is standing on the stage.
Is this your favorite song?
The door was locked and we couldn't get in.
I visited my father's grave.
Soon after that, I began to fall asleep.
You're loaded.
I knew I shouldn't have done it, but I did it anyways.
Get up early, or you'll be late.
Do you accept credit cards?
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday.
How do you explain all this?
Can you really not swim?
She lives in the same house her grandparents lived in.
Does she know your phone number?
It could be Tom.
This is all that I know about him.
He is slowly recovering from his illness.
This is my bicycle.
Obesity is a serious problem.
She teaches reading and writing.
I just don't understand you.
The power plant supplies the remote district with electricity.
What is the price of this cap?
I want to talk with the manager about the schedule.
I just finished reading the book.
She applied her mind to her new job.
He gave me some money.
I would like you to sing a song.
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
She has always been a popular actress.
They were peaceful.
Get your clothes on.
My hands were shaking too much to thread the needle.
We can't ignore this problem.
She turned her back to me.
I've tried to explain it to Tom.
Tom doesn't often eat lunch with his wife.
Welcome back.
You're very sophisticated.
Nobody came.
Don't tell anybody.
I had no idea of what she intended to do.
You are in part responsible for it.
What surprised me most was that she didn't like candy.
Sorry, I must have dialed the wrong number.
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Don't touch my stuff.
It is utterly impossible to finish the work within a month.
My sister has traced our family tree back to the 16th century.
She blamed her failure on bad luck.
That's all we know.
I didn't want to waste so much time.
Isn't that right?
Any child can do that.
Will you help me for a minute?
Maybe Tom should've stayed with the children.
You don't seem very concerned.
She was the last to cross the finishing line.
Who's hungry?
Could you actually eat this?
Have a nice weekend.
Why are you busy today?
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
Tom's father is very strict.
They're expensive.
What are you crying for?
How long has it been since you received a letter from him?
He has a heated swimming pool.
I have no one to talk to.
Tom put the envelope on the table.
I want you to call the police.
I live and work in France.
He is strong as a horse.
She asked him to not quit his job.
Rest is important.
Do you have a hobby?
We didn't think of that.
Are you in a good mood?
The bus is always crowded.
That is what this is about.
He's very influential in the world of medicine.
Are you going home by bus?
We both competed.
I'm always thirsty.
I really don't envy you.
Environmental changes gave rise to new species.
I have no idea why she got so angry.
I'll leave Tokyo for Osaka tonight.
Have you ever broken a bone?
Your idea is similar to mine.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
You will never be too old to learn.
I don't like any of these pictures.
I haven't seen you around before.
A crazy thing just happened to me.
Why are you speaking so loudly?
It's still too early to talk about this now.
I don't know a thing about her.
I just don't understand you.
He traveled throughout the country.
Will surgery help it?
He dried himself with a towel.
Anyone home?
There were no railroads in Japan at that time.
She held her breath.
Are you sure you can do this?
We all miss you very much.
Cucumbers, spinach, broccoli and onions are considered non-starchy vegetables.
It was quite funny.
I caused an accident.
What are friends for?
Could you speak more slowly?
Thanks for coming.
I can't believe I locked myself out again.
That's what I was working on.
No one escaped.
They struggled.
He has no common sense.
I saw a whale tail today.
I got acquainted with her in France.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Let's be extra careful today.
Certain details of the crime were not made public.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Merlin was a wizard.
You could've said something.
Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood.
What's your name?
You're so impatient.
I'm used to being ignored by my parents.
The number of students in this class is limited to 15.
Call if you need anything.
They were plainly dressed.
Whether he wrote it or not will always remain a secret.
I was asked to identify the body.
We haven't really thought about it yet.
I'll tell you exactly what to say.
She became more and more beautiful as she grew older.
Are there any cute girls in your class?
Nobody knows what to say.
Ask your dad to help you.
She came.
My dog is pregnant.
I cannot find fault with him.
I'm still married.
I think that it's completely understandable if she turns down his offer.
You should look this word up.
When did you see him last?
It was good enough.
Tom was asked to be best man at Mary's brother's wedding.
I know that can't really happen.
Where did you put my keys?
She robbed me blind.
She looks like her aunt.
The light doesn't work.
This just isn't like you.
They all cheated.
Who are you and why are you here?
Thanks for the updates.
No one was supposed to know about that.
My house is your house.
There are no problems.
I was searching for food.
We're all bored.
Let's do our best again today.
I like all my classes.
Have you ever seen a panda?
Where did I put my glasses?
She asked him questions.
He couldn't remember my address.
His way of thinking is very childish.
Have you even heard a word I've said?
I got my leg hurt in the accident.
I'm going to stay with my uncle in Kyoto.
Jesus loves you.
Don't you get it?
Come on up here.
Why aren't you studying French?
I'd never met Tom before this morning.
They're all mine.
Do you eat at home or eat out?
Tom wouldn't take my call.
That's kind of vague.
Isn't that what we were supposed to do?
Do you want anything?
Better to be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion.
Do you want us to try prying this door open?
His absence gave birth to all sorts of rumors.
I'll be back by six o'clock.
Can't we discuss this?
Advance two steps.
There are some things that are difficult to translate.
The door was wide open.
It was one of the worst experiences of my life.
Do you know how to drive?
I don't find her particularly attractive.
He's a talented young director.
We surrendered.
You're very forward.
Is it OK if I hug you?
Please don't forget to put stamps on the letters that I gave you to mail.
Tom is quite cooperative.
You don't have to make a different dish for every person.
Do you cook by gas or electricity?
Can you tell me what this word means?
You can't handle the truth.
I thought maybe I could buy you a drink.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants him to do.
They're not home yet.
I can't believe I'm going to lose my job.
I really trust his ability.
What do you want to drink with your meal?
My little finger is swollen.
Not everything is about money.
It will not make much difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
There is no answer to your question.
Why are you so insecure?
He is absorbed in reading detective novels.
When did you buy it?
When is the last time you wrote a love letter?
Men, dogs, fish, and birds are all animals.
I can't distinguish him from his brother.
I'm so proud of you.
I wonder if this is wrong.
Watch your tongue.
Do you mind if I take my shirt off?
I feel like seeing you.
That's the only reason I'm here.
I bought a book.
I was born here.
They're playing chess.
We appreciate your hard work.
You don't sound too sure.
They are much taller than us.
He moved out of his parents' place.
We're all wasting time.
I want to negotiate.
This is your final warning.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
They exchanged greetings.
My room has two windows.
We're on our own.
I really want to hold your hand.
I was in the hospital for a week.
You broke your arm.
It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
We have to get you to the hospital.
Let's go to the hospital.
I amused myself.
Do it at once.
What did you buy?
I'm friends with a lot of cops.
He worked from nine to five.
I want to make my father proud.
Parents should monitor their children's whereabouts.
Please help yourself.
Have you got a match?
He solved the difficult problem.
Hurry home.
Tom tried to save Mary.
Is anything broken?
I'll do whatever it takes.
Not all birds can fly.
You're not fat.
Tom didn't seem to be very hungry.
It was a great trip.
How many people died?
You can't believe a word of it.
Go and wake Mary up.
You're wanted by the police.
I didn't tell him everything.
The door will not open.
It's a matter of taste.
You can go there.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
She is going to learn how to drive.
My home is your home.
I'm not good at pretending.
I didn't catch the meaning.
My name is Tom.
I will be very happy to accept your invitation.
The audience consisted mainly of students.
Stand aside.
I don't know why I bother with you.
How long does it take to get to Boston?
She left home with everything she owned.
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
How would they know what to do?
Do you know whose car that is?
There is a park near my house.
This train runs between New York and Boston.
He has a large truck.
Is the museum visited by many people?
You're so impatient.
She asked how to cook the fish.
I want it done within the hour.
Did you win the trophy?
I feel fine.
Take care of yourself, OK?
I meet him from time to time.
This program is broadcast every other week.
This ship was ten meters long.
I'm turning thirty in October.
How did you get caught?
Let's take advantage of the long weekend.
Photography is an expensive hobby.
She has recently made remarkable progress in English.
I was just being friendly.
She's in danger.
Words cannot express the extent to which you are wrong.
I want to do this later.
I thought you were taller.
How can I upload a photo to your website?
You should tell the truth.
You don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it.
She has a hot temper.
It's an artificial flower.
We're not terrorists.
I don't have a weapon.
I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
Tom seems angry.
A fallen tree obstructed the road.
They are both working at the pet store.
Tom couldn't help but be impressed.
My father is proud of being tall and handsome.
Come over.
I can't carry all that baggage.
She passed the examination with ease.
Where did you learn to shoot?
We talked on the telephone.
I'd like you to keep this a secret.
That man is a famous cabaret performer.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
That's the reality.
His doctor advised him to quit smoking.
He was accompanied by his wife.
I don't get along with that guy.
I read your report.
Who doesn't like the beach?
Do you eat lunch at your desk?
I hope not.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
Is it a wolf?
She made a scene.
This is puzzling.
I've been misunderstood.
I'll never forget this experience.
We complement each other.
We're looking for a place to sleep.
I don't care for green tea.
Everyone gathered together for the picture.
It's not a matter of price.
You are not supposed to smoke here.
We saw a funny movie last Sunday.
He was too tired to go any further.
You're not as smart as me.
Who would you like to speak to?
Wait a sec.
He's a gambler.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
I'm going back to college.
Your cat will survive.
We asked him what he was called.
Our class has forty-five students.
You're such an idiot!
How can you be so callous?
How do you know I don't have it?
What other choice do we have?
I know exactly where I am.
He's pushing fifty.
My girlfriend is crying.
Get away from me.
The spaceship made a perfect landing.
The heater doesn't work.
It's obsolete.
The enquiry concluded that, despite his denials, the chief executive would have had to have known about the illegal practices occurring in the company.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
Why on earth would I do that?
I do not trust him any longer.
I refuse to be taken in by her guile.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
The news confirmed my suspicions.
We can't just stand here.
I stayed longer than I thought I would.
Tom's drowning.
They were so happy together.
Do you want to try it?
Was the work done by him alone?
Let me write down the steps for you.
Do you still not understand?
You said you'd do anything for me.
I have no plans whatever.
It was a great blow to us.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Are you almost ready?
He laid his head on the pillow.
I love to cook.
That's what I do all day.
Give the money to my son.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Tom is a businessman.
I got you all right where I want you.
I think I agree.
Did you turn the stove off?
I'll have it here for you tomorrow.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
She asked him how to get to the station.
Are you crying?
I want to see you in my office.
I don't even want to think about what could happen.
I guess that she is over thirty.
This tape isn't sticky.
There's really no reason for you to go to Boston.
When did you go to work?
My parents are opposed to my sister marrying a foreigner.
She's in a bad mood.
The tire leaks air.
I think we're pretty lucky.
I quite agree with you.
What's your biggest fear?
No one really cares.
Tom could see that Mary was crying.
She might have been beautiful when she was young.
She was superstitious, as the people of that period usually were.
Sometimes I run out of money.
I had too much to drink last night.
I didn't need anyone's help.
She couldn't convince him to write a song for her.
She is always forgetting my phone number.
Crime is down.
You are wanted on the phone.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
She didn't attend the meeting for fear of meeting her ex-husband.
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
They were all dressed in uniforms.
Your parents can't keep us apart forever.
I think I'll do that.
I feel like I know you.
There were no survivors.
Who took care of you?
The car is parked in front of the building.
I've never seen you like this.
Are you lonely?
That's what I've been saying all along.
It's your only shot.
No matter how fast you run, you won't catch up with him.
Why are people scared of Tom?
Get off at the next stop and take a bus headed to the airport.
What does she have?
I didn't care.
Connect the two cables together.
I went twice.
Where are the guns?
Is this love?
Follow my advice.
Was the victim male or female?
We had a secret meeting.
The kids are making too much noise.
You nearly died.
I'll be back before you know it.
He accused me of being a liar.
We must see the matter in its proper perspective.
What's the problem?
I think he is right.
They supported his right to speak freely.
I'm sure it wasn't me who broke this.
Tom can't be over thirty. He looks like he's about eighteen.
Strong winds accompanied the rain.
I pay 30 euros for every visit to the dentist.
Here's the address.
It's occupied.
They have drunk two bottles of wine.
Tom doesn't blame you for anything.
I don't know what that meant.
We're just getting ready to eat.
Tom is hiding something from me, too.
Crime is increasing.
There is a dragonfly on the ceiling.
Mary likes watching TV.
I think he's right.
All the stories are interesting.
I need to go shopping.
My mother made a sweater for me.
He went on to demonstrate how to use the machine.
Can you keep the noise down?
He lives off campus.
I let you catch me.
Welcome back.
What would I do without you?
We're starved.
He acted the part of King Lear.
Do you think it's possible?
We were surprised at his conduct.
I'll be nice.
I knew you liked me even though you never showed it.
She married him for his money.
Two years went by before I could find a good job.
How many apples do you want?
What a big boy he is!
I think we should call Tom.
I have a passport.
I didn't see you come in.
I'll never stop.
He sent me an affectionate letter.
Speak a little louder.
I'm afraid of spiders.
He came home at ten.
I know you're angry with me.
Tom persuaded Mary to do it.
They went surfing.
The guy with a beard is Tom.
We're not serious.
The prisoners were set free.
I thought you were going to fix the sink.
That's a very good suggestion.
Which one of those is yours?
Tom is in need of a vacation.
If you want any help, just call me.
Don't state the obvious.
What time did you close the store last night?
Tom's advice was very helpful.
He has a car which I gave to him.
Do your best and don't worry.
I can handle it myself.
I want to punch you in your face.
Her hobby is collecting stamps.
You'll thank me for this someday.
Tom tripped over something.
My bag was stolen.
Last summer, I worked part time on the farm.
Have you ever heard such a story?
If you need anything, just call.
They're going to try.
His room was covered with dust.
I'll be sure to tell Tom you said that.
Maybe I should do it.
Are you going to be OK?
She attended the meeting.
Tom really does talk a lot.
Stop screaming.
Tom can speak three languages.
It is not so difficult as you think.
Do you carry weapons?
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
I don't like to lose.
Tokyo is the capital of Japan.
Tom is the only person who can help me.
I promise you I'll help you.
Mind if I join you?
Do you want me to help you?
It was his best time.
Everybody needs food, don't they?
Are you single?
He was checking you out.
No problem at all!
His girlfriend did it for him.
Don't try to fool me.
Answer the phone.
I don't need a girlfriend.
They have no choice.
Clear off the table.
Be careful what you wish for.
I think it's time for me to go.
I want you to stay here longer.
Her sudden departure surprised us all.
Some things just can't be explained.
The train leaves in 5 minutes.
He is one of the greatest scientists in the world.
I don't need a lawyer.
My father used to read to me at bedtime.
I can hardly breathe.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
You're not being fair.
She acted in the play.
My uncle lives in the east of Spain.
I had a bad cold and was in bed for a week.
People who talk about themselves all the time bore me.
The cow gave birth to a calf with two heads.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Do you have these shoes in my size?

You must get going.
My birthday is on March 22.
I'm lucky.
New York is a big city.
Am I on the right road?
Today, I'm busy getting ready for my trip.

I prefer going out to staying at home.

I will bring it right away.
You're so impatient.
That's not a bad start.
Is this your car?
They're headed this way.
Bite your tongue.

Don't be upset.
I know that you live here.
May I bother you for a moment?
I have enough money to buy a car.
Folks, it's time I was leaving.
Please put yourself in my place.
I already sent an email to the support team.
You're too polite.
How does she do it?
I heard voices on the other side of the door.
You must be a good cook.
I'm hungry.
It's this book.
Tom looked really tired.
His word is law.
Don't be scared.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
His ideas never earned him even one penny.

That's absolute nonsense.
He'll arrive within an hour.
I owe you so much.
Thank you for your interest.

His pessimism depressed those around him.
It is wise of you to ask me for advice.
You can't back out.
Bring your children along.
We are responsible for your protection from now on.
The soldiers are dead.
All I can do is work in silence.
This chair is ugly.
I'm not sure when he'll turn up.
I'd like to take a closer look at that.
There's more to it than that.
Now I'm sad.
I've never been abroad.
Do they have money?
Are you finished reading the newspaper?
What time does the train for New York depart?
I never doubted it.
Buses in the country don't usually come on time.

I've come a long way.
You have to speak English.
It's not time to die.
I'm right behind you.
I'm starting to like you.
This tree is older than that car.
Take your coat off and make yourself at home.
I worried, of course.
She isn't fit for the job.
What were you doing that moment?
That's not enough.
Grab as much as you need.
You only really need to sound exactly like a native speaker if you want to become a spy.

I hope we're not too late.
About how many English words do you know?
You're the only person I know besides me who really understands this problem.
This is the only one I have.
He's hiding in the closet.
He squeezed the toothpaste out of a tube.
I don't know why I reacted that way.
Go slow.
Are we prepared?
We saw it on the news.
Are you listening?
We have enough money.
She raised her voice.
Let's hope we did the right thing.
He stood there for a while.
I just banged my head on something.
Tom never sings in public.
Tom knows he did something wrong.
Have you lost your ticket?
You should know it.
We live in Boston.
You're missing the point.
You will save time if you adopt this new procedure.
What are you looking for?
No one could see us.
What do you think you'll do with your life?
We're not going to leave Mary alone with Tom, are we?
Why are you being mean to me?
Beef, please.
There has been no rain for two weeks.
Sorry about earlier.
He's smoking more than ever.
It took me a little more time than usually to fall asleep.
I love to read.
Be still.
I wasn't involved.
You have a really good sense of direction.
The letter was addressed to me.
Have a nice day.

He has short hair.
This is your fault.
We accept all major credit cards.

Did you tell anybody?
That man stole all of his money.
His achievements were acknowledged.
He listened to the music with his eyes closed.
I don't know how long it'll last.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
Do you find that washing machine easy to use?
I am too tired to walk any more.
I'd like to be woken up tomorrow at 6:30.
Do you mind if I open the window and let the smoke out?
I neither drink nor smoke.
Do I detect sarcasm?
You don't have to lie.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
There is little, if any, hope of his being alive.
I can't stand it any longer.
I don't know who I'll miss more, you or your brother.
I think you're nice.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't do that.
How long do you have to eat lunch?
It's time to plan ahead.
How is the weather?
He was a Frenchman. I could tell by his accent.
I was just wondering what kind of pets you have at home.
How did you come up with such a good excuse?
Three weeks went by.
Watch me.
There are a lot of things you don't know about my personality.
Sometimes trying your best just isn't good enough.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
You are not kind.
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Boston for more than a year.
I don't feel like studying today. Let's go to a soccer game.
You won't believe this.
How are you going to stop Tom?
Tom beckoned me to come in.
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
The nurse anticipated all his wishes.
I could not come to your birthday party.
Tom didn't know what else to do.
I kid you not.
We used to live in Kobe.
I don't care anymore.
Human greed is threatening the existence of many species.
They stopped to talk.
I got that from Tom.
I know when to say when.
How many children do you have?
I'm in the house.
What they wanted was a man like himself.
You did an excellent job.
We are to meet at noon.
I'm here to protect you.
You cannot live by love alone.
I beg you.
How many flights to Tokyo do you offer a day?
You're tough.
I think you'd better lie low until she forgives you.
He made for the door and tried to escape.
This is the most comfortable chair I've sat on in a long time.
Tom greeted Mary with a smile.
A bad cold has kept me from studying this week.
I thought you might want some breakfast.
I'll get used to it sooner or later.
Don't give up the fight.
Let me help you put on your coat.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
I know that you still think about me.
I need more information on this matter.
Our only daughter died of cancer.
That boy is very clever.
I really missed you.
Help yourself.
You should apologize.
What exactly is it that you want me to say?
It seems interesting.
Isn't that annoying?
He treated me badly.
He died in his bed.
It's terrible.
I don't think he is fit for the job.
He failed the entrance exam.
Unemployment is high.
If you can't come, please let me know ahead of time.
Good luck with the new job.
Is there anyone who speaks English?
No matter how hard he tried, my opinion didn't change.
We're not invited.
In addition to that, he failed the examination.
We really are hungry.
How was school today?
Some people say that it is human nature to root for the underdog.
Let's begin.
All you have to do is to do your best.
Please stop.
He is a scientist.
I thought I was happy.
Isn't it enough?
There's someone here to see you.
I can't tell you what to do.
This party's packed.
The car raised a cloud of dust.
He had an unpleasant screechy voice.
Tom volunteered to pay for the damages.
I'm so happy to finally be back home.
Tom closed his eyes.
You should have seen me.
They were punished for their crimes.
He is leaving Chicago tomorrow.
Lunch will be provided.
I did it for you.
He was too tired to walk any more.
As these trees grow tall, they rob the grass of light.
Thank you for not smoking.
I didn't see you until now.
I like watching people.
I don't know why you didn't tell me immediately.
I'll need at least three days to translate that thesis.
I really am interested.
Who am I supposed to go with?
What did she say?
They got into the train.
A fire broke out in the supermarket last night.
You can't just not show up.
He was painfully skinny.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
Be creative.
What did you want to tell me?
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
It's non-refundable.
It's my pleasure.
I hope they don't resort to violence to accomplish their goals.
You'd better not go today.
They were scolded by the teacher.
Tom introduced Mary to his mother.
He's an opera lover.
He refused to pay.
I wish he were on our team.
I want him to leave.
I wish you had come with us.
Do you know Tom's girlfriend's name?
Don't let go. Hold on tight.
Is this really spaghetti?
Just say yes.
The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
I believe Tom will be acquitted.
What did they hit you with?
She's busy now and can't talk with you.
I could sure use that reward money.
Can you stay for a few days?
Here's some medicine for diarrhea.
Tom showed Mary how to boil water in a paper cup.
I never wanted to compete with you.
You should know it.
We're from here.
She asked him to not quit his job.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
He wrote to me from time to time.
Did you turn off the heater?
Tires wear down because of friction between the rubber and the road surface.
After a brief peace, war broke out again.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
It won't cost you a dime.
I'd do anything for you, Tom.
I was afraid of my father.
You've run out of things to drink.
He doesn't have the necessary skills for that task.
Is everybody happy now?
My mother set the table.
Hey, don't forget this.
This is all so strange.
Salmon lay their eggs in fresh water.
She always takes her time in choosing her dress.
Can you tell me why you like him?
Tom died on Monday in Boston.
What are you writing?
I don't worry about that stuff.
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
I'm not a violent person.
You cannot take back what you have said.
I haven't had time to thank you properly.
The doors wouldn't open, so I had to get in through the trunk.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
There's bamboo growing in the garden.
Are you thirsty?
I'm going to run a couple of errands. Wanna tag along?
I needed your help on something, but I couldn't find you.
I thought I'd prefer going by myself.
Tom should've been in bed.
Few students use pencils these days.
I thought you were having a good time.
Tom doesn't have anything to eat.
It's noisy next door.
Tom wants to move to Boston.
He shuddered with horror at the grisly sight.
We'll catch you.
You don't have to apologize.
She visits the dentist on a regular basis, so she seldom gets toothaches.
How certain are you that he's a criminal?
Small children are very curious.
I can't remember how to say "Thank you" in German.
Fish such as carp and trout live in fresh water.
Don't make me laugh!
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
They are considered the greatest rock band in history.
I received your note.
I'll be raising my prices by three percent next month.
Tom hid it behind the door.
It's a happy thing.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Things got out of hand.
He was out of breath.
Tom greeted me politely.
I've got as much money as he has.
I swear it's the last time.
Tom started clearing the table.
I want to go to Sweden.
Tom won't admit it, but he's secretly in love with Mary.
"Let's go to the movies next time." "What makes you think there will be a next time?"
What does that mean?
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
They hired someone else for the job.
I have bleeding gums.
We are next-door neighbors.
I'm not invited to parties.
On my way to the library I met my friend.
Tom, you should see this.
Are all of them your friends?
You're incredibly talented.
Tie your shoes.
Please sit down.
This is an ancient law.
She is aware of my secret plan.
I visited my grandmother's house.
Leave out this word.
I used to be fat like you.
I wonder what it feels like.
Are these your daughters?
I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket.
I never have trouble falling asleep.
How do you know they're looking for us?
I pretended that I didn't see it.
I hope you don't mind.
I bit my tongue.
They forgot to lock the door.
I have run short of money.
I ran away in a hurry.
Do you still play the piano?
Are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
I went to the airport to meet my father.
I came here to learn.
I can't stand hospitals.
I'd like to speak with you.
One should always do one's best.
Open the bottle.
The police are looking into it.
I saw a light far away.
Did you find out what time the meeting starts?
He spends too much money.
It was quite funny.
I must go.
My girlfriend is a good dancer.
Everybody is supposed to wear a tie at the party.
We have room for three more.
Make a copy of this report.
Are you speaking to me?
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
Are you jealous?
A little heavier rain might cause a flood.
I figured I might find you here.
I did that without asking for anyone's advice.
I think that actress is one of the most beautiful women on earth.
What an interesting party!
It's very kind of you to invite me to your birthday party.
Carbon monoxide is a poisonous substance formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon compounds.
Where did you put my keys?
That's exactly what I was doing.
I am going to make him a serious offer.
You're looking very well.
I want to hear all about it.
They don't care.
What are you all doing here?
He is ashamed to ask questions.
The situation worsened.
I turned on the lights.
I inspired my students to work harder.
It's his.
Tom abandoned that idea.
Are you lying to me?
If you don't study harder, you'll fail for sure.
You can call us at any time.
What makes you smile?
My brother works in a bank.
Tom found it very difficult to breathe.
I don't really want you mad at me.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
He is used to the work.
She looks pretty in that dress.
It took all day.
I figured it was worth a try.
Please be quiet, everybody.
I hate school.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
You're the teacher.
Dissolve the tablet in a glass of water.
Are you afraid of a little girl?
I was burned.
Would you mind looking after my kids?
I want him to leave.
Do you know where he bought his camera?
She has brains.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
It was worth every penny.
I'm hiding.
High fructose corn syrup is found in about everything you eat these days.
I feel responsible.
I have enough money to buy it.
What'll you be doing this summer?
Would Tom agree to this?
She came out on top.
I didn't say it.
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Sometimes all we have is our dreams.
She looked at the picture to refresh her memory.
Tom brushes his teeth after every meal.
Is Tom one of your friends?
What time did your friend go home?
Tom likes ponies.
That movie was a real tearjerker.
There's no chance that he'll recover.
It's warm enough to swim.
How many people were at your party?
Let's meet on Sunday.
I don't work well under pressure.
I haven't met with Tom recently.
It's very interesting.
I grabbed my little sister's hand and started running.
It's not very good.
We hope to see you again.
I thought you didn't know that.
That's what I expected it to be like.
I don't doubt your intentions.
How often do you use your phone?
Tell Tom what Mary told you.
Reading books is very interesting.
I see a light.
Are you ready to party?
He has no money.
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
You are morons.
He pays no attention to others' feelings.
I'm getting ready for the worst.
She started talking with a stranger.
I wonder what has happened to her.
Your mother is going to kill me.
Justice will prevail.
The traffic light changed to red.
In spite of our encouragement, he decided to throw in the towel.
Are there oak trees on the hill?
What narrow stairs!
It's worth every penny.
It never happened.
Has it occurred to you that you might be the one with the problem?
I feel so happy when I'm with you.
Tom doesn't smoke anymore.
Sit down here and warm yourself.
Their teacher praised them.
I think we did OK.
Will you turn on the TV?
I won't let you down.
You could've told me the truth.
You can't eat chicken? How do you know if you never try it?
Let's talk this thing out, OK?
I was really emotional.
You're not my friend anymore.
Tom doesn't know who to ask.
How many songs have you written?
I'm going there now.
We shook hands.
Tom bandaged Mary's arm.
Do you want to see more?
Grandpa always said there'd be days like this.
I want to kill you right now.
How did you get those?
Get ready.
We can't give up.
We work every day but Sunday.
I'll do anything to make it up to you.
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
I'm looking for my key.
You're the only person I know who is my age.
I want to study French.
What I can do for you?
He talks as if he were rich.
They're smiling at each other.
He's out taking a walk.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
We're eating apples.
I think it's time for me to walk away from this mess.
What a letdown!
That boy showed no fear.
I was young at the time.
This clock is electric.
He paid no attention to my advice.
Tom goes to bed at the same time every night.
I really can't talk right now.
This room is quiet.
I can't eat meat.
Do you know where she was born?
I was so sure this was what I wanted.
We advised them to start early.
It's not a secret anymore.
I have certain standards.
Australia is abundant in minerals.
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
My parents come from China.
I broke my arm.
We're here to play basketball.
Can I get a pillow?
Let's talk man to man.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Now tell us what we want to know.
Follow your desire.
You don't have to answer this question.
We want you to sing the song.
The milk is sour.
He just texted me.
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
That's not a crime.
He found me a good place.
That's my younger sister's photograph.
Stop teasing me.
Things might've turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I'm afraid that he can't do it.
We were driven to the wall.
She works with single-minded determination.
You don't seem too sure.
Didn't you hear me?
I feel happy.
I am ready.
The shop was crowded with young people.
You can eat all you want.
I think it's much better now.
I think you're too picky.
Please give me a piece of bread.
What I was looking for was right before my eyes.
My parents never punished me for anything I did.
She was the first one to pay attention to him.
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
I just don't want to be left alone.
The meeting was cancelled.
I don't want you to leave.
I see you've made a friend.
She owns a large mansion.
He worked all day yesterday.
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
When did you get back from Boston?
This is your key.
I didn't ask you to do that.
I can't explain what happened.
I cannot lend this book to you.
Tom has to learn to relax.
Is that not clear?
You're unforgettable.
We wish him well in his future endeavors.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.
Don't interrupt me.
Fortunately, there is an elevator in our hotel.
These are not your forks.
What do you desire?
He examined the spare parts one after another.
What's your favorite subject?
I watched television instead of studying.
The man is starving.
I'm really cold.
Blood poured from the cut vein.
You don't have to obey such a law.
Is it safe?
She is a twin.
You're very brave.
Who's replacing you?
Why are you sitting there?
Tom hasn't arrived yet.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
I'm not being unreasonable.
She woke him up.
Selling newspapers isn't easy.
I don't like to go out when it's dark.
Why do you want to do this?
You despise Tom, don't you?
This is our home.
How can you not see that?
Is this a joke?
There is a river between Saitama and Chiba.
We meant no harm.
He's not going.
Please think it over.
He had gone there to help garbage workers strike peacefully for better pay and working conditions.
What's your problem with straight people?
He's been waiting here for a long time.
Let's stay here.
I don't get the joke.
When did you find out?
Can you tell me about it?
I can't feel at home in a hotel.
It's nice to be appreciated.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
This is the monsoon season.
Tom claimed to be an expert in finance.
Where's the nearest supermarket?
I'm looking forward to meeting you all after such a long time.
The employee was escorted off the premises.
It's conceivable.
You really lucked out on this one.
Tom fell flat on the floor.
Who is your teacher?
I want to serve my country.
We're all very good players.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm very hungry.
Give it to whoever wants it.
Is Tom cleaning his room now?
Don't stand too close.
I quickly ate lunch.
He left the box unprotected.
I just want to know what I'm getting into.
I would really appreciate a glass of cold beer.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
We just want to live in peace.
Do you weigh more than Tom?
She played the piano with enthusiasm.
I thought I'd always be alone.
He was dazed by a blow to the head.
I have problems with my wife, too.
You are wrong.
I forgot what I was going to say.
If you want to come with us, come with us.
I didn't tell anyone about it.
You can't bury your head in the sand.
Let's bounce.
It's the only one there is in the shop.
I couldn't get rid of my doubt about it.
You had no choice.
My parents made me go there.
There's a fire in the building. We have to evacuate immediately.
Tom tried to hit Mary.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
Tom has no chance, right?
I can't forgive her.
How often do you wash your sheets?
I've won.
I feel like I've known you forever.
I haven't lost any weight.
You're not one of us, are you?
I felt a drop of rain.
We're fixing it.
He told me an interesting story.
How does it feel?
He's been dead ten years.
Why don't you stay a minute?
What is your name?
I have to be back home by seven.
What happened? You look pale.
You will listen.
I'm your biggest fan.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
She'll be seventeen in February.
The guitar is so expensive that I can't afford it.
We had a blast.
Wash your feet.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
She refused his proposal.
We got lost in the fog.
It makes me so happy.
You're in danger, Tom.
I've only got one left.
I was afraid I wouldn't have the pleasure of meeting you.
The landlord told him to leave because he hadn't paid his rent.
We all live within a five minutes' walk from each other.
The story ends happily.
Snow reminds me of my hometown.
You'd better not drink too much coffee so late at night.
Did you open all the boxes?
She called to tell him that she'd be late.
Look up this word in the dictionary.
My feelings for you haven't changed.
We all need to work together.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
You can make your own.
She is sharp.
I'm not too convinced.
I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.
According to my accountant, this isn't a good time to invest in the stock market.
Reading books will make you smarter.
Stay in bed.
Could you please tell me why you love her?
I think you look hot.
Do you have any idea what's in the box?
He respects his father.
It's not our fault.
You reek of alcohol.
It seems that something has happened.
Where were you on 9/11?
We're all done here.
How long will we have to wait?
Does it really matter?
He's got lung cancer.
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
What are you talking about?
The man looked at me.
The image is not in focus.
He read the letter with tears running down his cheeks.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
You're not yourself today.
It's a magnificent view, isn't it?
Hang on!
I don't want you to worry about me.
Is this fake?
Tom has to work tomorrow.
You were right about this.
He had no memory of the accident.
I have been to Kyoto once.
He is working in the field of biology.
I'm afraid I don't agree with you.
This does not bode well.
We discussed the article I published.
I'd be very glad if you came.
Do you mind if I get started?
I put my hand on his shoulder.
How much is this tour per person?
She picked out a pink shirt for me to try on.
How much are these shoes?
We saw it.
I left in the morning.
She died yesterday afternoon.
Do you know how to dance?
He let us go.
Do you ever think about that girl?
I'll get you a towel.
Even though he was tired, he went on with his work.
That's not something I would joke about.
Did you forget something?
As soon as I can get the chance, I'll come for a visit.
I want to know why this happened.
Mary isn't Tom's wife.
He fell ill because he ate too much.
What I need is a friend.
He threw a piece of meat to a dog.
He will never give in even when he is wrong.
I just emailed you.
Something very weird happened to me yesterday.
What a weird idea!
You are a doctor.
He boasted about his skills.
They all cheated.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Bread and milk are good foods.
Let me repair it.
I think we need a doctor.
I'm afraid she will fail.
He stayed at a cheap hotel.
I just don't get modern sculpture.
English is studied in China, too.
Did you recognize any of those people?
He worked for a rich man.
I haven't found a doctor yet.
I've never seen a more god-forsaken stretch of desert.
I'll do it according to your instructions.
I am a runner.
Let's watch a horror movie.
I've already told Tom what to do.
Do you have health insurance?
I had no place else to go.
Children should be taught not to tell lies.
That was very good.
She's an alcoholic.
He is always reading.
I'll be honest.
Someone knocked on the door.
It always happens like this.
She had time for her favorite hobby.
I guess you never learned how to do this.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
Here's your change.
We're trying to cut down on expenses.
That's unimportant.
Maybe he likes you, too.
Turn up the volume.
There's no one in the room.
The pier took a real beating from the hurricane.
Tom was here just a moment ago.
The prince became a king that day.
People can choose to start loving, but can't choose to stop.
Tom said he'd like to have another cup of coffee.
Don't do that. It's not your job.
Tom called to say that he'd be late.
I like shopping on Ebay.
Tom showed Mary the photo.
How about a beer?
They want you dead.
Wait, it could be dangerous.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Stay in bed.
We can not agree with you on this point.
My parents live in the country.
I rejected the offer.
Do you believe what he said?
He came back home a while ago.
How could Tom do such a thing?
I gave my seat to the old lady.
I have a bad sunburn.
One of you is lying.
I remember it now.
The bank was held up last night.
We found her alive.
I was born here.
She isn't paid monthly, but daily.
Tom has a 13-year-old daughter.
Don't talk to me like that.
Do you mind my making a suggestion?
I know what we can do.
I have a black eye.
I feed my dog once a day.
Don't open the box yet.
I don't know whether he's younger or older than I am.
You don't have to eat it.
This house needs painting.
She emerged from the kitchen.
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party.
We plan to go as far as we can.
Tom was screaming at Mary.
Please show me another one.
He keeps two cats.
Who can prevent it?
If so, then there's no problem at all, is there?
We love our customers.
Don't get off while the vehicle is in motion.
He has to have an operation next week.
He is washing his car.
His family didn't have much money.
You're too polite.
He got into his car in a hurry.
Don't complicate the problem by raising new issues.
She saw me enter the store.
You sound like you don't want to be an archaeologist.
I can't dance either.
What were you doing then?
Excuse me, could I get past?
Could you get me another beer?
I have to get away from this place.
The statue has no head.
If I told you, you wouldn't understand.
Which hat do you want to buy?
You know very well how it happened.
Why did you keep that a secret?
I was fortunate to make his acquaintance.
I'm not allowed to help you.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmer.
We need to get rid of Tom.
Stay away from my daughter.
I'll take that into consideration.
That's very thoughtful.
Hold on a minute.
Tom comes from Australia.
This is the office in which he works.
Let's go if it's not raining.
He stood at the end of the line.
It's a quarter to two.
Tom wants to know more about Mary's past.
I'm not the kind to kiss and tell.
I can do it now.
Are we allowed to use the elevator?
He sat next to her.
We felt the house shake.
Not a soul was to be seen.
There's a catch.
He could not control his anger.
How do you want them?
I believe what he says.
Take no chances.
Don't take this personally.
Who is currently the richest person in the world?
Thank you for stopping by.
Can you ride a horse?
If only I could go skiing.
Nobody was home.
Do you have something to show me?
The new birth policy is aimed at achieving zero population growth.
Why don't you eat vegetables?
As long as I know the money is safe, I will not worry about it.
You'll be in trouble.
Even if it should rain, I will start tomorrow.
Does this have to be done now?
Here's your milk.
Do you think Tom will like the concert?
We'll have plenty of time.
Tom told Mary that their relationship was over.
Tom didn't know where to park his car.
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom is dying.
Let's take a look at the facts.
How far is it from here?
If something is wrong, tell me.
First, I want to eat a little bit of cake.
Do they have a computer?
If I had eaten more for lunch, I wouldn't be hungry now.
Cookie is a good name for a dog.
She is trying to save as much money as she can.
He compared the copy with the original.
Who coaches the team?
Sit down, please.
Your lives will be spared if you surrender.
You should attend to your own business.
How can we thank you?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
You have to trust me.
I want you to go home.
The job is almost done.
She denied having met him.
That's why I worry about you.
She advised him to go by bicycle.
Tom folded the blanket.
I really enjoyed it.
We're going the wrong way.
Don't open the door for anyone.
I am not your enemy.
Tom is a cold-hearted murderer.
It feels good to be back.
I don't like sad movies.
A helicopter is able to take off and land straight up and down.
Your dreams have come true.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
The cold weather kept us indoors.
I ask your forgiveness.
I'm trying to talk to you.
He leaves for China tomorrow.
I need medical help.
My father is busy.
Stop playing hard to get.
They were speaking in a Southern dialect.
Don't fall for his old tricks.
Is it something you can get rid of?
I got acquainted with him last year.
I was with Tom from 8:30 to 2:30.
Tom collects old coins.
I twisted my ankle.
We have an obesity problem in this country.
Tom is making faces.
Wouldn't it be a better idea to cancel everything?
Are you here to arrest me?
You're very stylish.
Do you want us to call you?
Are you asking me on a date?
She could always call her parents when she was in a crunch.
I hope she's safe.
She is always kind to everyone.
He found my bike.
A coin dropped out of his pocket.
You will be missed by your friends.
I know that this is important to you.
What is there to understand?
She refused his offer.
Today is not so cold.
Is this normal?
Is he any better today?
Do you need our help?
What makes you think that'll work?
What would your mother think?
I haven't given up yet.
If you could manage to go camping with us, we'd be delighted.
I thought that was the right thing to do.
You're very good.
He said that he was busy then, but that he would be free the next day.
How much will you get?
I don't know them at all.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
He collected a lot of stamps.
Back off.
What would you do if you saw a man from another planet?
I love playing Chopin.
I received a letter from her.
You cannot heal a broken heart.
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
How's your family?
I liked walking alone on the deserted beach in the evening.
I'm starting to dislike her.
You're incredible.
I didn't know what I'd find.
We shouldn't be seen together.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
I hate the color of these walls.
I'm going to regret this.
I will have to be away for some time.
I like this answer.
The lights are on.
I don't even have a single girlfriend.
Tom asked Mary to play tennis with him.
I hate when other people make me wait a long time.
The theory is not accepted yet.
He told me that I could use his car.
What a beautiful scene!
He really ticked me off.
I figured out a way to make more money.
Guess what I'm holding in my hand.
I don't remember what it was about.
There is a very old temple in the town.
She must be over eighty.
You're the best dad ever.
She never wears green.
I gave it to the little boy.
Is this love?
She poured water into the basin.
I'm supposed to be the one helping you.
Everyone is outraged.
I know you are rich.
I won't say it again.
She's a bit naive.
That's it. I've done everything I can.
I've been here all night.
We can't go there.
I'd like to say a few words.
Why are you being mean to me?
You put in too much pepper.
He keeps a diary in English.
Tom couldn't borrow as much money as he needed.
I'll speak to him at the first opportunity.
What are some good foods to eat with potatoes?
You don't have to sing.
Not knowing what to do, I telephoned the police.
I waited for him till ten.
Everyone was drinking.
When did you go to work?
Wake me up at seven o'clock.
His mother is worried about him.
He's a man of his word, so you can count on him.
I can't ask Tom to do that.
I'm as old as you.
Tom introduced Mary to his mother.
It is sometimes difficult to make yourself understood in public.
One of them is a spy.
I must insist.
He drank a beer.
Have you finished dressing?
She's strong-willed.
I think this coat should fit you.
The committee can only act in an advisory capacity.
Enjoy your meal!
I gathered from this letter that he was angry.
What did you do with that book?
Show me how to do this.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
His story sounds strange.
Tom got his head bashed in.
Don't be alarmed.
Apples are red or green.
I was just trying to help.
Do you like music?
That's all we need.
I find you very attractive.
I know all I need to know.
I'll never forget shaking the President's hand last year.
There were ten eggs in all.
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance.
Where do we know each other from?
Where do you get your ideas from?
Our car ran out of gas after two minutes.
I saw him three years ago.
I'm eating a sandwich.
I only did what was necessary.
I'd like to get off at the next stop.
I suggest you leave.
Tom couldn't hide his pain.
She'd like him to leave right away.
Man is mortal.
It was not until I had a baby myself that I knew what mother's love is.
I feel the same way as you do.
They forced her to confess.
I looked down.
When you come next time, bring your brother.
He doesn't have a computer.
Tom is not able to drive a car.
I don't understand why it happened.
You'll get over this.
Everything's very cheap.
It amazed me.
Tom says he didn't do it.
You may be able to pass unnoticed in a city, but in a village that's not possible.
I met him the day before.
I don't know yet, but I'll find out soon enough.
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
The conflict between blacks and whites in the city became worse.
We will fight to the last.
I have a toothache.
A young man broke into my house last night.
You need to stop.
She comes to see me from time to time.
That didn't really happen.
I was careful.
Tom was sitting near a very attractive woman.
Fishing is fun.
It is evident that he has made a mistake.
The buildings are small in comparison to the skyscrapers in New York.
Wouldn't you rather spend your time doing something you enjoy?
I'm an artist.
I'd say you did well.
We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.
I guess I should get home to the missus.
I feel like someone is watching us.
I studied English for four years with a native speaker.
Doctors take an oath not to harm anyone.
Tom shaved off his mustache.
He is so honest that everybody trusts him.
I want to learn French.
The cops are looking for the gang's hideout.
It can be confusing at first.
I didn't know that he was there.
She is my girlfriend.
Do you remember me?
I think I'd like to marry her.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
You won't need it.

Without you, I am nothing.
He adores his grandfather.
Let me know what you want to do.

What are you trying to hide?
That nickname fits him perfectly.

Please keep quiet.
I'm lazy.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
Nice timing.
I ought to know, shouldn't I?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Did the phone wake you?
This doesn't fit.
I can't live without her.
What does not kill me, makes me stronger.

I can't turn the shower off. Could you check it for me?
I'm not certain Tom likes that.
There is something you must know.
I'm addicted.
She cooked us a delicious dinner.
You don't seem very concerned.

He's mad at everyone.
It was noisy.
That's the most important thing in the world.

We're just hanging out.
Who's at the wheel?
I've just gotten home and had dinner.
Where do you know each other from?
We still don't know the truth.
What should I do next?
That would seem likely.

A red dress looks good on her.
Is that mandatory?
That was his catchphrase.
Someone broke the window.
Do you come here every day?
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Did you pay for everything?
I guess I'd better be going.
He was not impressed.
Children should not be spoiled.

He wants an apple.
I've already read it.
Clearly you're not interested.

They're going to the war.

You don't seem very pleased.
He ran away from home three times before he was ten.
You should do all you can to help your neighbours.

What's that picture inside your locker?

He flatly refused her requests for help.
Why are they always fighting?
Don't forget to write the zip code.
The moon has come out.
I was beginning to worry about you.
I hate this town.
What did I just do?
Tom is tall, but not as tall as me.
That's your department.
Well done!
I'm hungry because I haven't eaten.
I wonder which one I should choose.
Tom drank himself to death.
The two generals met again the next day.

My three-year-old niece kissed me on the cheek.
I don't want to go back to Boston.
He left immediately.
That's not fair and you know it.

I'm a married woman.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
Let's start right away.

We're surrounded.
You need to rest.
I only have American coins in my pocket right now.
He didn't say anything.
She told him to stop.
How did you do?
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
He will be back soon.
I want to know where you plan to live.
I'll take some X-rays of your teeth.
How do you think I feel?
Thanks for calling, Tom.
You are only young once.
Is college worth it?
We sometimes meet them.
Do you like to be kept waiting?
I did something bad.
Music is a universal language.
Tom has red hair.
Excuse me for opening your letter by mistake.
Tom told me he wasn't happy here.
You shouldn't be in here.
The accident took place near that intersection.
It's hard to support a family on minimum wage.
He stamped out the fire.
Someone turned the alarm off.
I fell asleep while reading.
I'm no friend of yours.
Were you able to solve the problem?
They wanted something better.
Life is short.
He walked away.
He seems to know us.
They must have known it all along.
Don't forget to take your pills.
I've had enough of your snide remarks.
Tom doesn't know where Mary usually goes skiing.
I will come and see you when I get well.
Can you help me clean this up?
We were all shocked.
He finished it as quick as lightning.
I spend a few hours a day maintaining my website.
They're looking for a scapegoat.
Stay in bed.
I don't even vote.
I'm not really that thirsty.
It is better to give than to receive.
They live downstairs.
I'm laying you off.
I want to make a statement.
You are beautiful.
She's an honest girl.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
He's a famous popular singer in Japan.
Tell me what you think.
I think it's unlikely that I'll be able to pass my driving test.
We're getting close.
This doesn't work!
I had intended to go abroad.
They'll know what to do.
He clearly stated that point.
The power went out.
These are our kids.
If I had worked hard in my youth, I would be successful now.
He found the door locked.
I didn't want you to get involved.
I've never seen you like this.
It's yours if you want it.
I just wanted to say thank you for all your help.
You must be cautious.
Are you sure?
Do you play soccer or rugby?
I like all of them.
I don't feel like singing.
This must be a mistake.
I suppose I'd do the same thing if I were you.
He was holding a large box in his arms.
Tom showed Mary his stamp collection.
Tom is the legal owner of this piece of land.
Why would somebody want to live there?
His accomplishments speak for themselves.
Let me see the pictures you took in Paris.
They had no idea what to expect.
Being too nervous to reply, he stared at the floor.
I can't thank you enough.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
He had served as a congressman and senator.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm lonely.
I'm not used to this heat.
Now that school is over, you can go home.
Lunch will be ready soon.
I have many things to do now.
I brought you a present.
Not all people like dogs.
Are they friends?
I must go to work early today.
Speak louder, please.
Everybody has secrets.
Thanks for your explanation.
You can come if you want to.
Tom didn't feel like playing golf.
It is impossible for him to do it in a day.
I agree to your proposal.
He passed his English examination.
He runs very fast.
This sounds totally legit.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
Don't walk so fast.
I'm glad he liked it.
What time do you close?
You smell wonderful.
Mother is in bed. She caught a cold.
You deserve more than that.
It would be prudent to worry about the details now.
Am I disturbing you?
Telephone booths are very scarce around here.
How did you get them?
I should've told you.
It might rain tomorrow.
She forgot that she bought him a present.
I would rather walk than wait for a bus.
Tom needed something.
We want candy.
Don't you dare touch anything.
I miss college.
Would you mind coming with me?
I'm sorry for what I said. I was out of line.
Sorry, but I want to tell her this news face to face.
That doesn't belong to me.
I gave it away.
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
There are a lot of beautiful songs on these records.
Won't you go shopping with me?
This is a big problem.
All my friends have bicycles.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
I don't think I can wait that long.
Couldn't we cuddle, instead?
She ironed her shirt.
This is awful.
It will be dark soon.
Is that normal?
Are you listening to me?
They know our plans.
I didn't go to the market.
I love bearded men.
He seldom comes to see me.
I'm ticklish.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
You're the oldest.
You're very open.
What did you just say?
What's the new guy's name?
I'm in love with a wonderful girl.
We're very satisfied with it.
Have you called the boss already?
I don't know if it is good.
It's pitch black outside.
I'm your neighbor.
It may, indeed, be a mistake.
All he is thinking about is meeting her.
You have a message.
I want to be a magician.
How far do you live from here?
Life is full of mysteries.
What did he say again?
That house is for sale.
We went to a movie.
Stop the car.
I bought it.
She lit the candles.
The coal is burning.
What's your favorite holiday activity?
He breathed deeply.
They seem to be enjoying themselves.
I suppose you think I'm crazy.
Tom felt very tired.
You're sleepy.
I made a paper plane.
He was a great poet as well as a doctor.
Don't you want to help?
I want you to stay here with her.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
Have you ever cheated on an exam?
Dozens of students gathered there.
Give it to them.
I had the gardener plant some trees.
May I see your driver's license, sir?
She demanded to see the manager.
They never found out the truth.
Please let me know when you come to Osaka.
I guess you didn't quite understand me.
They're so funny.
The stock market crash of October 1987 in New York is still vividly remembered.
We have a big day tomorrow.
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
I thought we had a deal.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I can hear a cat scratching at the window.
I just want to thank you.
He's an interpreter in an international bank.
You know I'm wrong.
Did you watch TV last night?
She will be in New York for two weeks.
He went by bicycle.
I was jealous of you.
His ideas never earned him a dime.
I never should've gotten divorced.
We ran in the park.
They kept drinking.
Flip a coin.
The day will surely come when your dreams will come true.
We must always be ready.
I'm not happy about it.
Where were you? We've been looking all over for you.
I'm not wearing any underwear.
It's my turn to tell you a secret.
He doesn't know me.
She borrowed the book from him.
Tom didn't have a lot to say.
I always watch the weather report before going out in the morning.
Eat everything.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
Tell me what to do here.
Tell me which of the two cameras is the better one.
I cannot put up with his bad manners any longer.
We probably don't want to do that again.
I'll lend it to you.
I'm retired, too.
Tom didn't look very well.
Let's pretend we didn't hear that.
I prefer to remain seated.
How did you get our address?
I just want to get some sleep.
I want to shake your hand.
She bolted the doors and windows.
You can get dressed now.
Please take more care in the future.
Are you still happy?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Money doesn't necessarily make you happier.
Stop being so nice.
I want you to read this book.
I tried to tell you this before.
My watch keeps very good time.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
Job security became a major worry.
I'll check your vision.
While they were away on vacation, their neighbors looked after the dog.
Put it back.
My sister showers every morning.
Are you good at cooking?
I forgot to send you an e-mail.
The woman who he thought was his aunt was a stranger.
I hope we can make it to your party.
She picked me an apple.
You don't look very strong.
Please don't do it.
I don't like to sing in public.
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
Tom would do anything for his sister, Mary.
His schedule has been changed.
I eat my breakfast in the office.
You said you didn't care.
What's your natural hair color?
Does he live here?
The police held back the protesters.
That's all I knew.
I figured it wouldn't hurt to wait for a few more minutes.
I promise you I'll keep you safe.
He must be very angry to say such a thing.
My friends dropped by to see me the day before yesterday.
I hope you are all well.
I really miss my girlfriend.
I want my father to see the movie.
I accept the risk.
It is dangerous to swim here.
I'm not proud of it.
I remember hearing this tune before.
I think we're neighbors.
I had to see you again.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
Where did you get the hat?
If I knew how to use a computer, maybe they would pay me more.
It's not how much you know, but what you can do that counts.
Will people make fun of me?
Can you still remember where we first met?
Are you absolutely sure that it was Tom you saw?
I need some get-up-and-go.
I sent an email to you.
You know the law.
He was English.
Tom arrived at the hotel.
He came in through the window.
I got sucked in on a lot of phony deals.
We'll all work together.
This newspaper is free.
Where can I get a telephone card?
The experience soured his outlook on life.
She is convinced of my innocence.
I saw people wearing jeans.
How long did you stay there?
I'm afraid something is wrong with my watch.
We were worried we might miss the train.
Have you already spent the money Tom gave you?
I see why you don't want to go there.
There was nothing you could have done.
I'll demonstrate.
I don't know either girl.
I always brush my coat when I come home.
I never meant to put you in any danger.
The word has several meanings.
I took her arm.
Are you still not convinced?
He promoted the idea of world government.
My shoes are the same size as his.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Clocks used to be wound every day.
She has a very good figure.
He's my older brother.
That's a tough question to answer.
I'd like to explain this in a little more detail.
It was Tom's idea.
Now's the time to apply.
The machine's yours now.
Who'll be the first to die?
You will be in charge of the women working in this factory.
Well done! You have drawn this picture nicely.
This sounds fishy.
I did have fun.
You don't look well.
We looked at the sky, but couldn't see any stars.
I call her very often.
She was at a loss as to what to do.
What do you usually eat for lunch?
I'm surprised to see you.
This is incredible.
You are so childish sometimes.
Can I have some water, please?
I got a taxi in front of the station.
I can't be seen with you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You didn't have to ask.
They're spies.
She used to pray before going to bed.
Tom left his wife and children.
How many did you want?
I could intervene.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
I wish you'd talk to me.
I don't mind walking in the rain.
Traveling is easy these days.
They slept in the same room.
This is so depressing.
I will give him the book tomorrow.
She sings out of tune.
I feel better today.
She has asked the person at the front desk to connect her to that number.
They awarded her a gold metal for her achievement.
Here is your dog.
Without your encouragement, I would have given up this plan.
Without water, we cannot exist.
I'm ready to go.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I'm a citizen of the world.
She is in bed with a cold.
You must not give up.
It's refreshing.
He's a slowpoke.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Don't buy things on credit.
I don't have the slightest idea.
According to the newspaper, he participated in the plot.
Should we cancel?
My mother's going to kill me.
I enjoyed your company.
How do we find it?
I'm a bit tired.
She's hyperactive.
Tom has less money than his brother does.
I think you did very well.
What was his motive for doing it?
He ran at the sight of the policeman.
Don't treat me like a dog.
I remembered everybody.
This watch is a real bargain.
Have they ever come on time?
I didn't read it all.
Did you go to Tom's party last Saturday?
I'm glad you weren't here.
This photo was taken by Tom.
We all cheered.
Stay very still.
Take it easy!
I think Tom is a coward.
You've got another four day's journey before you reach Moscow.
I hope you won't tell anyone you saw me leave this house.
We have an English class today.
She is eighteen at most.
You have to eat before you go.
Just give me what I want.
It's bad for the heart.
I saw her swim.
Tom has a high opinion of Mary.
I've tried to talk to Tom.
She is wearing a brooch.
I didn't mean to surprise you.
How's your morning been?
The accountant would not concede the mistake.
The truth is that nothing is totally true or false.
Is it far from here?
Do you remember how we met?
That is my book.
Where did you have in mind?
If it were not for water, no living things could live.
How did you become involved in this project?
That's the house I stayed in.
Rainy season begins in June.
You look stupid.
He drew a straight line with his pencil.
I must leave.
Is it all right to take pictures in this building?
Turtles are reptiles.
I want to be in your life again.
Now I know why.
Tom didn't need it anymore.
How many hotels do you think there are in Boston?
Pink is for girls.
I saw him go out.
Did you settle the bill?
When do you mean to start?
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
I know where she lives.
Blue is my favorite color.
I love Mary.
His house was sold for ten thousand dollars.
They're all hungry.
Nothing has changed.
Who invited you guys?
A lot of people applied for the job.
What did I say wrong?
I'm seeing you in a new light.
I'm overreacting.
We flew nonstop from Osaka to Los Angeles.
Who is your mother?
I'm planning to disguise myself as a doctor.
Are you still up?
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I won't let you ruin this.
Cookie is my dog.
Give me a white piece of paper.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
After the war, he managed to escape to South America.
She ran very fast to catch up with the other members.
Tom wished Mary good luck.
Almost no one believed him.
Why did you call?
It's pretty new.
I like running.
You're rude.
I didn't expect you to get here so soon.
They set to work at once.
I just got back from my morning swim.
Each time I went to see him, I found him at work.
We've got bigger problems.
All of us will die sooner or later.
She married him.
Tom was badly beaten before being killed.
You have to get up.
Tom wasn't in his room.
He's very experienced.
Are you watching your weight?
I caught a cold.
He left for London yesterday.
Look on both sides of the shield.
He showed us some pictures.
He requested help.
Tell us what you want and we'll try to get it for you.
They're coming.
Yes, we can go.
Do you have an English dictionary?
I'm not skinny.
If he has time, he will come.
I think it's going to be a nice day.
This thin book is mine.
He has a lot of acquaintances.
If it is fine tomorrow, we'll go on a picnic.
Help me out.
I'll go anywhere you want.
I loved working here with you.
I thought you'd got lost.
Did you think I was Canadian?
The car is old but in good condition.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
That's not how I want to be remembered.
The girl treated her horse kindly.
I think I could get used to living here.
They became friends in elementary school.
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
Black suits you.
No matter what you may say, I won't change my mind.
You are my pride and joy.
I'm not flexible enough to sit in the lotus position.
I always thought Tom would outlive me.
She called me in the afternoon.
Vigorous exercise makes you sweat.
The garden is separated from the road by a fence.
Why have you been avoiding me?
I was on my knees.
Tell me about it!
This is a time of year when people get together with family and friends to observe Passover and to celebrate Easter.
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
That's not what I just heard.
I'll play along.
I want to go wherever you're going.
This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it.
He's a bit naive.
The pain has lessened a little.
Let me think a minute.
I don't want to offend you.
As far as I am concerned, I have nothing to say.
I will go, rain or shine.
Are you here voluntarily?
I can't condone what you did.
That kind of thing can happen when you're in a hurry.
Perhaps he knows this story.
Tom is much taller than you are.
They agreed to start early.
We will be back tonight.
He will arrive in Kyoto tomorrow.
My TV set is almost 15 years old, but it still has a good picture.
We are encouraged to use our imagination.
I hate this place.
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry.
Your plan didn't work.
Tom won a free car.
Do you have dinner plans?
Fill the bucket with water.
The swimming pool is closed due to the storm.
She felt as if she had seen a ghost.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
She can say whatever she wants.
I remember what I saw.
Come into the room.
We discussed the matter.
He wants to see us again.
We came to a place where the road branched into two lanes.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
We should keep this information under wraps for the time being.
Even my parents don't like me.
Lay down on the couch.
What is it you want to sell to us?
He can run fast.
You must have been surprised to find me alone with her last night.
Jorge can speak four languages.
I think you sent me the wrong document.
I've never stopped loving you.
Tom didn't get paid for it.
We saw the sun sink below the horizon.
No one seems to know the answer.
Did you drop it?
They know what happened.
Let's get off here.
It was the happiest time of my life.
How often do you shower?
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
Tom always keeps a set of jumper cables in the trunk of his car.
They looked up to him as their leader.
The book is on the table.
I'll give you five dollars.
I like coffee hot.
I don't like kids.
She had a happy time with them.
I love old prewar gangster movies.
He took a taxi in order not to miss the train.
You are beautiful.
I don't want to hear about all your ex-boyfriends.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Don't get up.
I just wanted you to accept me.
Do you still have feelings for her?
Shouldn't you be at school already?
Where are you from?
Expect no mercy.
I want some paper.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I don't recognize any of the people in the picture.
I'm calling to tell you what I need.
Tom is a good kisser.
Do you have any Japanese newspapers?
It's all I've got.
Who knows what's going to happen?
He rarely stays home on Sunday.
My dog has a long tail.
When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person.
I'm as hungry as a bear.
We depend on each other.
I hate to see you like this.
What does that mean, exactly?
Do you want this or don't you?
Would you like to eat something?
He gorged himself on ice cream.
Which airport do I leave from?
I won't keep you too long.
It was quite easy for me to carry the plan out.
When did you finish it?
I think Tom did a really nice job.
Do you know where the nearest American Express office is?
We don't want to take the time now.
She cried as she read the letter.
It's an old pain.
Cut that out!
When she returned to her room, the diamond ring was gone.
Everyone likes them.
I'll never forget this incident.
Who did you go with?
He was all alone in the house.
I won't tell Tom.
I hope you have insurance.
I'll carry this suitcase for you.
Wash your face.
Can I have a word with you?
I want you back.
All of us have some interest in history. In a sense, we are all historians.
These documents were printed on recycled paper.
I think love doesn't exist.
We cannot offer a further price reduction under the current circumstances.
I was alone in the classroom.
Winter is right around the corner.
I think you know that's impossible.
I don't sleep anymore.
I will explain it to him.
I suppose you'll be needing this.
I'm ready if you are.
Has he given up cigarettes?
He's somewhere in the park.
I'm a bit drunk.
I've got nothing more to say.
I thought you'd wear something like that.
I think you need to spend a little more time on your homework.
She went to Italy to study literature.
Take off your hat when you enter a classroom.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Please speak French.
You must not touch the paintings.
Tom complained that he had too much homework.
I want you to come and get me.
What's it going to be?
I hope you had a great weekend.
I tried to cheer him up.
I just thought you were happy.
Absolutely nothing is permanent in life.
Tom got mad at Mary because she was late.
Put a lid on it!
She trusted you.
I didn't know that soccer was such a dangerous sport.
Drop your gun!
Please leave.
Why do I have to do that?
I don't want to go.
It was Tom who did that.
How's your old lady doing?
You're too loud.
I thought I'd be too late.
If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some.
I don't want you to be upset.
Tom needs a prescription.
In Singapore, one way to punish a criminal is to whip him or her.
I am sad to hear it.
All of the town was destroyed by a fire.
They're both in love with the same girl.
He finally found out how to make it.
It's no problem.
If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it.
Have you heard the news yet?
Come over!
I assume you've heard from Tom.
Do you think my cat and your pet rat will get along well together?
I think that I should leave.
What's making this sound?
Give me a hint.
You need to reboot your computer.
I threw the strange package on the table.
He has a beautiful daughter.
All of us stood up.
Twenty people died in a fire.
That's why I'm not getting married.
It belongs to me now.
I totally believe you.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
You're probably too young to understand why we have to do this.
You must obey the traffic rules.
I had to go back.
This book is divided into four parts.
Tom changes his passwords often.
I hate to see you so miserable.
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.
I think it natural for her to decline his offer.
Tom drank my apple juice.
They'll be rooting for you.
He was alone in the room.
It's a shame.
He should be angry.
I burned them.
She introduced me to her sister.
I'd like you to translate this book into English.
He has a foreign car.
Thanks for the meal.
He is still very much alive.
The food supplies will not hold out till then.
You don't frighten me.
It all depends on Tom.
It's no easy task to keep up with him.
I just got tenure.
I wasn't talking to you.
Tom pulled out his gun.
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
I played catch with my father.
You don't sound very confident.
Tom wrote the report.
He lived to be eighty years old.
That's the snag.
You're very beautiful.
I would rather go to the art museum than to the movie theater.
If you want me to, I'll do that for you.
Nothing will take me away from you.
When did you begin to learn English?
You'll feel better.
Come over for dinner sometime.
Is it helping?
Let's improvise.
You should not be afraid of the future.
Tom didn't really feel like going out drinking with the guys.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I feel ready.
Last summer I had a chance to visit London.
Tom corrected himself.
The simplest solution is often the best.
I showered before breakfast.
I thought you were older than me.
I'd like to go with you.
I like to laugh.
He started to study in earnest.
I'm not home.
Now that Tom is unemployed, he has quite a bit of free time.
I respect you more than anyone.
We can all walk home.
You're going to have to call Tom.
They're afraid of him.
I think it's true.
Tom taught Mary to read.
Certainly he is handsome and intelligent, but there is something about him that I can't like.
You need to be more patient.
Have you finished the suggested reading?
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
You'll never be alone.
May I try it on?
He might have been sleeping at that time.
You can never be happy if you feel envious of other people.
I thought Tom was sleeping.
When I didn't know how to answer the question, he gave me a hint.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
You've been warned.
He is afraid of death.
This is a mistake.
She has nothing to do with that affair.
Can you do this problem?
They kidnapped me.
What was wrong with them?
I can't tell you what we did last night.
We're here, too.
How did you get here?
When is a good time for you?
Tom sat at the kitchen table.
He left the window open.
Do you need some water?
Did that hotel meet your expectations?
Let's hope Tom got our message.
He stared at me and said nothing.
We hugged each other.
When's this supposed to happen?
We're bored.
If you're tired, rest.
He asked me who that man was.
Excuse me, but may I open the window?
I haven't talked to anyone but Tom today.
They're all watching TV.
Who taught you to write?
You'll have to stand on your toes to see.
It looks like you've been crying.
You can't wear that.
I need it.
Will you tell him about it when he comes home?
I'm the happiest man in the world.
He told me not to drive too fast.
Would you like a dog?
He searched all day for the letter.
Tom backed up his data.
I prefer white chocolate to dark chocolate.
It's so bad, it's hilarious.
Do you have plans tonight?
Why are you so tired today?
May I trouble you to shut the window?
I'm very sorry I came home so late.
They've all gone crazy.
She is two years older than you.
Does the story have a happy ending?
I don't think that there is any better way to learn English than by living in America.
We had no trouble.
I don't trust politicians.
He came to my rescue.
He seldom writes to his father.
We were together.
Why ask me? Wouldn't it be better to do it yourself?
Is that your own idea?
I hope you learned your lesson.
May I call you tomorrow?
They made the goal.
Go back to your seats.
We all die.
Bring me the menu, please.
Did she show you the picture?
Tom undressed and got in the bathtub.
I will help you.
My mother doesn't know how to ride a bicycle.
Everything comes to those who wait.
We don't have tea.
I'm not a drug addict.
She kept on talking.
They're not here yet.
You are both pretty and kind.
I used to take a walk every morning.
Tom spends very little time with his family.
More than half the residents are opposed to the plan.
The research director had the department do a thorough job in testing the new product.
Is Fox News biased?
How can you know that?
How many times have I told you to fold your clothes?
He caught a boy stealing his watch.
I must learn this poem by heart.
Tom dressed himself quickly, then ran out the door.
You really are hopeless.
She put up with the pain quite well.
I can't eat or drink very hot things.
A child is missing.
I will go if you go.
The children go to school in the morning.
Who did you think I was?
I watch lots of movies.
I've lost my glasses.
He is too smart not to know it.
Let's go back the way we came.
I think he won't come.
I was expecting you.
You shouldn't write in library books.
We saw the tower in the distance.
We need another person to play cards.
I don't know if I have enough time.
He died an unnatural death.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
I do hope Tom does what he says he'll do.
This is appalling.
It seems that everybody likes golf.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
I had no idea you felt that way.
I didn't know you were awake.
She is afraid of dogs.
I want to make sure you're going to be all right.
Please keep this a secret.
I want my stuff.
Tom would help us if he could.
What do you want me to tell Tom?
He meant no harm.
I used to be fat like you.
Don't tell me you didn't see it.
I was afraid he might die.
Christmas is just around the corner.
I can fix it.
Who is younger, him or me?
I don't like to eat fish with many bones.
The exhibition is already open.
His condition got worse every day.
I can't. It's too big.
You're very forward.
We're reading.
I couldn't find anybody.
Weigh your words well.
I don't like dogs.
We can't see anything.
I seem to be lost.
His debts were piling up.
I watched baseball on TV after I finished my homework.
We're not dead yet.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
He came into the room.
They're looking for you.
I want to take the test now.
Are you on drugs or something?
I've dreamed of this day.
This offer is good for five days.
Are you ready to go out?
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
We depend on foreign nations for our natural resources.
Make good use of your time.
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
We have no time.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
I love traveling in the winter.
The butcher ground the meat.
Your mother will repeat it to you as many times as necessary.
Show him how to do this.
How do I get out of this mess?
I will probably get up early tomorrow.
There is some wind.
He left the motor running.
I did something I regret doing.
What do you think of Tom's new tattoo?
His words rendered me speechless.
What do you think they'll do to me?
Maybe he likes you, too.
That dress looks stunning on you.
The heat turns off automatically when the room reaches a certain temperature.
You look younger.
I'm ready for a break.
Would you like to take part in the festival?
He drew a straight line with his pencil.
I told Tom not to come.
Do you know what day it is today?
I'd like to buy this doll.
I am suffering from a bad cold.
Wait till the light turns green.
I'd like to go out with you.
The dog is as good as dead.
They want more.
I like tea.
I outrank you.
I can walk to school in ten minutes.
You should look up this word.
I can't wait that long.
Tom is a handsome guy.
This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
In fact, the opposite is more likely to occur.
It's not a difficult problem.
This is the last train.
Though she was tired, she kept on working.
I entrusted my wife with the family finances.
She's rather clueless.
I don't want to be involved in that matter.
What's this mess?
Tom does little other than play the guitar.
I will always be with you.
She was wearing a blue coat.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
The recent shortage of coffee has given rise to a lot of problems.
You're out of luck.
They keep calling.
Tom often helps Mary.
You are a student.
What is it you want most?
It was very sensible of him to reject the bribe.
I was expecting you at 11:00 a.m.
You ought to have been more careful.
I used to be the same age as you.
This is impossible.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
We may as well start at once.
I'm all for your suggestion.
They're not criminals.
It isn't worthwhile going there.
What bugged me most was having been deceived.
Don't bother.
She does look tired.
He was hanged for murder.
I hate losing.
My life is almost over.
Please have some copies made.
You're free to go.
I was a high school student at that time.
There's something I have to ask you.
Do you like oysters?
His death surprised us all.
Everyone is very proud of you.
Instead of going myself, I sent a messenger.
I think we can handle that.
Are you insured?
Take a sip of this.
There's something about Tom that I don't like.
You have to stay fit.
I appreciate your efforts to help me.
She gave it to me.
It's an outrage.
I didn't want you to miss your bus.
If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
Let me pay.
I'm going out for a while.
Are you drinking?
Who's taking responsibility for this mess?
Quit wasting my time.
She is proficient in both Spanish and Italian.
Can I ask why this is so important to you?
I don't know when I should come.
Work slowly.
I know what it's like to be poor.
You can't believe that.
You can't blame him.
I let the team down.
Don't leave your dog inside all day.
I am going to sleep.
How come I've never seen you here before?
I appreciate your conviction.
He had called the rebels traitors.
You can use my car if you drive carefully.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
He always gets home at 6:00 p.m.
Tell me about it!
They were forced to withdraw.
We'll be together soon.
Did you say something?
I can't believe you bought this.
What is the name of that bird?
This condo is getting old. Why don't we redecorate to give it a fresh feel?
She's rather good.
I read all kinds of books.
I can't believe I used to watch this show.
They're out to get you.
I waited for ten minutes.
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
I think Tom really deserves it.
I ordered several books from England.
He refused to take the bribe.
Lend me a hand.
I finally found a use for this old thing.
All our food was rotten.
All share the blame.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
I expected you home an hour ago.
He's been waiting here for a long time.
Thank you for today.
I saw you outside.
Is it cruel to declaw your cat?
I thought you were serious.
Where can I leave my bicycle?
The size of a man's laundry bill is no criterion of his income.
The meeting was held here.
I have to do my homework instead of going out.
I dislike living in such a noisy place.
That makes sense.
If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car.
Tom is not a very friendly guy.
It was love at first sight.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
I think it's time for me to take a break.
He is crazy about baseball.
They have brown skin and black hair.
Who broke the window?
I would love to read a book on the history of laughter.
You saved us all.
Don't sass me.
We'll leave tomorrow, weather permitting.
I often think about the place where I met you.
I think I've had one too many.
As a result of a traffic jam, he wasn't able to see her off at the station.
Tom hadn't seen Mary in a while.
He's addicted to heroin.
So what's the plan now?
I can tell you're a nice guy.
The enemy destroyed many of our ships.
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
Tom is breathing normally.
I can't just leave you here.
It seems less crowded during the week.
My brother has no money.
You're not fit.
I already did that twice today.
The choice is all up to you.
Don't you see what you've become?
This law is applicable to all cases.
He committed one crime after another.
It is obvious that he is right.
She tore the letter up after reading it.
Is her father a doctor?
Can I ask you something?
I'm not a criminal.
I finally understand what you're saying.
It's kind of important.
Don't leave things half finished.
She may not come here tomorrow.
Tom and I are in the same class.
Get out of the way.
What if the unthinkable should happen?
Tyranny is everywhere.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
The more you learn, the more you want to.
I don't like hot tubs.
You need to be careful.
I've seen it.
Tell me when to start.
We can't do that.
I'm constantly telling her to behave herself.
I haven't seen them anywhere.
What fruit do you like the best?
Two men are trying to figure out what's wrong with the car.
It is no exaggeration to call him a genius.
I'd like the bill, please.
He would sooner die than get up early every morning.
I see you are ready.
I know you were born in Boston.
There are many rooms.
Tom didn't have anything else.
They don't make 'em like they used to.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
Something fishy is going on.
I love being a teacher.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
She was a child, but she was brave.
You obviously don't live here.
You'd better sober up before the boss gets back.
This is just between you and me.
It's really not that hard.
I knew you'd come.
I want to go to school in Australia.
There seems to be something peculiar about the boy.
Give me a full glass of water.
Your sister's as beautiful as ever.
Hurry up and bring me something to drink.
Live and let live.
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing.
Tom is Mary's fiancé.
His family did not have much money.
You can't have both.
I saw Shin'ichi in Kakogawa yesterday.
Can you tell me your address?
You can open your eyes now.
How are you?
The rent is far too high.
She ignored him until he became rich.
That girl looks boyish.
He went out a few minutes ago.
We're here alone.
We're still involved.
Who will look after your dog?
It's the dry season here.
Because some urgent business came up, he wasn't able to go to the concert.
Who is he?
I admit he's smart, but does he have to talk over everyone's heads all the time?
I have no children.
Shouldn't you overlook his indiscretions and forgive him?
This is my brother's.
What season do you like the best?
He touched me.
I know what I'd do.
That leaves no room for doubt.
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.
I'm way stronger than I used to be.
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.
I'll have skim milk.
I'll be back in thirty minutes so I'll be in time for the concert.
There's no guard.
Well, what does that tell you?
Tom seemed disappointed.
Can I have a word with you alone?
Tom is not my friend anymore.
She knows me.
He's come to make trouble.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
He finds fault with everything I say.
I will gladly help you.
Where exactly did you go?
Get up early tomorrow morning!
Why didn't you just leave?
I am so busy that I can't help you.
We communicate with one another by means of language.
Is this good English?
Thank you for your help.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
My computer's acting up.
Do you think that dress suits her?
He is introverted.
I'm not the problem.
Ten is ten percent of one hundred.
These figures don't add up.
What are you writing?
Tom is able to play soccer.
Pour me a drink.
He predicted she would win.
We used to do a lot of things together.
When did you become a teacher?
Can you promise me you won't tell Tom?
I think you had better take a rest.
I'm counting on it.
Don't believe everything you read.
You may disagree with me.
I had the exact same feeling.
We need rest.
It's about time to start.
Have you ever known me to be mistaken?
I don't have that information.
It was a great privilege working with you.
The price of this camera is very high.
I have read the book before.
That's your choice.
What's the big rush?
He was jealous of my success.
She knows everything about cooking.
I just want to be left alone for a while.
My neighbor was arrested last night.
I wonder who did that.
At that time, I was still awake.
Take a break.
I want you to get off my back.
Don't get discouraged.
What is he up to?
We need something to eat.
"I like traveling." "So do I."
Tom broke his promise and didn't help Mary.
I think we'll get off at the next station.
I wanted to remember.
You're telling lies again.
That doesn't sound good.
I can't run as fast as you.
What did you write?
I think we could be great friends.
You're very timid.
You've found it.
They're mine.
Are you a wizard?
I take a bath almost every day.
I feel strongly about this.
I plan to try reading some other books.
Tom can't help you.
We've talked about that.
Do you watch television?
She is very intelligent.
I had no idea you were so stupid.
Are you lonely?
The whistle of the steam train woke us at daybreak.
You don't realize how lucky you are.
Is there any coffee in the kitchen?
I'll decide.
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
He is talking of going to Spain this winter.
Is this what you want?
Please be careful.
You'd better go. It's getting late.
His story is much more interesting than hers.
The birds flew to the south.
I just want a little more of that.
He bought a bottle of cheap wine.
I'm begging you. Don't make me laugh. I did too many sit-ups yesterday and my stomach muscles hurt.
No one could solve the puzzle.
He seems unable to swim.
If I were a foreigner, I probably wouldn't be able to eat raw fish.
The store is close to my house.
I didn't hear what you said.
You've done enough.
Is this all of them?
I nailed it.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I want what's best for both of us.
You have only to touch the button.
I bought some Romanian books for the students.
This doesn't fit.
He has a natural bent for music.
What are you so scared of?
Are you eating lunch?
He is said to have been a good teacher.
He denied that fact.
I've worn out two pairs of shoes this year.
Drink more water.
He owes his success to good luck.
She is often late for school on Mondays.
Don't walk out on me again.
Is your daughter blind?
Who gave you this?
My mom spoke with the school superintendent.
I can lend you some money if you like.
He brought me back in his car.
I like to finish what I start.
I'm really stressed out.
They can't do that.
Let Tom make the decisions.
I need a doctor.
I've looked everywhere.
There is a park in the middle of the city.
Maybe Tom wants to sleep a little longer.
The car is blue.
I just have one other thing to do.
The score is 9 to 2 in favor of our school.
Tom is listening to his iPod.
He admitted that it was true.
Tom doesn't know who Mary has decided to give her old guitar to.
"I don't have time to spend with my kids." "You should make time."
Is there something in particular that you want to hear?
Anybody can participate.
To improve your fluency, you should try speaking with native speakers as often as you can.
It was fabulous.
Don't look into the box.
He gave an address to the nation on TV.
Nuclear power is used to generate electricity.
It's an emergency.
Have you ever failed a class?
I just don't want to catch your cold.
I personally believe that you're right.
Do you want to join me for lunch?
This isn't safe.
Who's taking responsibility for this problem?
Tom wondered if Mary would think that eight in the morning was too early for him to open a bottle of wine.
Would you like ice?
I don't really want to go there by myself.
Whenever I hear that song, I think of my childhood.
I've never cared about such things.
How could they have done it?
I'll put some salt in the soup.
Blood circulates through the body.
What's all the fuss?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I would buy this watch, except it's too expensive.
He was a great musician.
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
They decided to put an end to the discussion.
I'm going to my room, so I can study.
This is something I must face alone.
Did you speak with him about your projects?
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Tom didn't want to talk to anyone.
How much do you have invested?
He tried it with a friend.
She was absorbed in her work.
Thank you very, very much!
It was a test.
I want a better look at this document.
She writes with her left hand.
She gave considerable thought to what to do with the money.
She was always ready to help people in trouble.
She is trying to prove the existence of ghosts.
The tickets I bought are non-refundable.
Cows provide us with milk.
He needs it.
I bear him no malice.
Your parents know where you are.
Forward this to everyone you know.
I'll come back soon.
You need to be more patient.
We have no need for assistance.
I know this.
I've always thought you knew how to swim.
He was born in this very room.
The problem disappeared as if by magic.
Tom didn't answer the phone.
We had no choice except to put up with it.
How's the dog?
You shouldn't be angry.
I told Tom how to get to our house.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
He can swim well.
Her beauty will fade in time.
It seems that our sense of direction is not always reliable.
We are two of a kind.
Tom should have been eating more vegetables and not as much meat.
Are you a team player?
Germs can cause sickness.
She called off the party.
They rushed towards their mother.
I saw him crossing the road.
That meant no.
You need an ambulance.
Tom said he shot Mary in self-defense.
Paris is one of the cities I visited last year.
Take a deep breath and then relax.
Quit sitting on the fence and make a decision!
The lake is deepest at this point.
She's drop-dead gorgeous.
Can you drive a stick shift?
I'm trying my best.
You probably don't remember me.
You need to be careful.
These politicians are corrupt.
I've never seen you laugh.
You can invite other people.
I'll help you after work if I'm not too tired.
They refused to be drafted.
Mary likes helping others.
Are you ready to order?
I've seen that picture before.
We were able to catch the last train.
I hear you're good at French.
I withdrew my application.
I had my money stolen.
You're not going to want to miss this.
We are accustomed to wearing shoes.
Is there something you want to tell me?
That should last three weeks.
They lied.
I was more than a little shocked by this.
If you want to go, then go.
I was about to leave for work when the telephone rang.
She is good-natured.
It is wrong to tell lies.
I thought you had learned that by now.
Did you order any food?
Tom didn't know what else to say.
That room is not very large.
It's a very quiet room.
She had changed so much that I couldn't recognize her.
All the prisoners escaped.
Tom played the piano for three hours without taking a break.
This is a good suggestion.
I know where Tom lives.
She started from the summit.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
Let's go back to the motel.
Prices are double what they were two years ago.
I have three pieces of baggage.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's not too early.
I think we are in agreement.
They were very excited.
She confronted him and demanded an apology.
He was a god to his people.
She did not answer all the questions.
Where are you going to move?
Tom works for me now.
I don't drink that much beer.
I don't want to meet your parents.
What language were they speaking?
Tom is very good-looking.
I know you're hiding something.
Why can't you come?
It didn't happen that way.
They are satisfied with the new house.
I don't have the option.
She seems to be sick.
Are you hungry now?
You may stay here if you want to.
I think what Tom is doing is terrific.
I lost my wife last year.
I lied on my job application.
They missed the deadline.
Have you ever seen a whale?
Is that not normal?
You have to leave everything.
There are six apples in the box.
I want to please you.
I know your brother.
She intends to participate in a beauty contest.
I appreciate what he did for me.
You're very brave.
She will be here tonight.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
She held her baby in her arms.
Do you have enough money to buy one?
That's not what I understand.
Just keep moving.
You can't skateboard here.
I should have come earlier.
Don't try to carry too much.
She danced with him at the high school prom.
Don't even get me started.
Why do you permit it?
I don't want to go bald when I'm still young.
If I had my way, you would all be fired.
Tell Tom we're waiting for him.
We need to remember that.
A clear conscience is the sure sign of a bad memory.
Can you do it faster?
Each state had just one vote.
There were no radios in those days.
It's an interesting argument.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
No one was in the room.
What will you have?
I asked Tom why he had never studied French.
I need a concise explanation.
I hope that you will like it.
His nose is bleeding.
I'm saving as much as I can.
This offer is available for five days.
Foreign direct investments in China amounted to $3 billion last year.
The camera you bought is better than mine.
They made the right choice.
They can't all be full.
We're fasting.
The product is vacuum-sealed to keep it fresh.
He was awfully skinny.
He doesn't get along with anybody in the office.
We left four days later.
I do not like tea, so I generally drink coffee for breakfast.
She got into the car and drove off.
The last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain.
Tom and Mary are playing chess.
Do you have any idea who did this?
She and I have been married 30 years.
She's sitting in the kitchen and drinking tea.
He will have to undergo an operation next week.
I think you panicked.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
I don't know how you did it.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
Go right ahead.
I'd like you to come work for me.
No one can foretell the future.
Please tell me what I should do first.
She spoke to me with a smile.
As soon as you have done that, I would like you to start preparing supper.
Look at this picture.
Tom burst out laughing.
He's a food critic.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
It's something they always wanted to do.
It's hot today, isn't it?
This is my bicycle.
Don't be ridiculous!
The news broke his heart.
My mom taught me how to do it.
Would you like some more cake?
I'm very hungry.
It's all over.
He accused me of being a liar.
The dog answers to the name of Blackie.
Tom attempted to persuade Mary to go to church with him.
I'd like to talk to the hotel manager.
He says what he thinks regardless of other people's feelings.
I don't like Tom and I don't trust him.
Stop crying like a little girl.
I can't believe this is all happening.
He didn't succeed in explaining what he wanted.
I spent the whole day reading that novel.
I don't know what I owe you.
Spain is a developed country.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
Her daughter is sick.
Who ate the bread?
The house belongs to him.
Everyone was surprised.
The waves are high.
Time is on my side.
Luna is a reliable person.
Tom didn't know Mary.
You're very attractive.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I'm trying something new.
I had to see it for myself.
I'm sorry I have kept you waiting so long.
I'll buy this.
Let bygones be bygones.
The path is direct.
I'm feeling low.
Never tell the truth when a lie will do.
Evil sometimes wins.
In 1939, as in 1914, the world was on the brink of war.
I follow orders.
Close your eyes, please.
Why do people go to the movies?
I'll have it here for you tomorrow.
There are some eggs in the box.
Do you remember?
I don't know how to thank you.
Put the scalpel down.
She'll love him forever.
She has such beautiful eyes.
You did not come to school yesterday.
Come down here.
Stop sucking up to the teacher.
Let's have some fun.
Tom has a house with a pool.
I'll pay my own way.
The Statue of Liberty is located in New York.
Didn't you know that oil floats on water?
You're so bossy.
Don't fall off!
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Where are my clothes?
If you buy me an ice cream, I'll give you a kiss.
I'm not scared to die.
I assume you're angry.
I'll stay there till six o'clock.
Do you know her?
Come and sit by me.
It was just a passing infatuation.
Has anyone ever broken your heart?
I have no time to help you with the work.
The suspect is a caucasian female.
You're resilient.
I know how hard it is to do that.
In case of an emergency, call the police.
I think we need to go back to Boston.
An important quality of steel is its strength.
Being very tired, I soon fell asleep.
We got separated.
Tom has nowhere left to go.
Some believe in UFOs and others do not.
I've heard of him, but I don't know him personally.
She asked him to read it for her because she had lost her glasses.
He OD'd on cocaine.
It sounded easy.
I don't feel like joking.
That was mean.
Sorry about earlier.
I have a sweet tooth.
I've been thinking about it.
I was happy there.
A more experienced lawyer would have dealt with the case in a different way.
She invited us to her birthday party.
Don't be late for school again.
Here is one of my pictures.
Are you up?
I hope to see reindeer on my trip to Sweden.
Can you tell me how you found out that Tom wasn't at school today?
It was a forced smile.
It came apart.
Tom is the father of three children.
We're thinking of adding on another bedroom to the house.
He's right here.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
I can't praise him enough.
I was hurt and upset.
She was born in Switzerland.
I don't think I can help you.
Thanks to his help, I finished my homework.
Tom died in Autralia in 2013.
That's more like it.
I want to talk to you about last night.
They almost got us.
We watched a new program on television.
My foot hurts.
I was sound asleep.
Obviously, she's sick.
Something did happen, didn't it?
I put it here somewhere.
You don't seem very sure.
We're all having lunch.
Search everyone who comes into this room.
I never thought I'd see Tom again.
The river's water level has risen.
I vaguely remember meeting him.

I'm doing this for my family.
I need some get-up-and-go.
He knows the truth.
I just wanted a shoulder to cry on.
He is sure to succeed.
It's a windy day.
And who did you learn that from?
What should I do in order to save time?
Don't forget to charge your cell phone.
How long are they?
Get to bed.
He's attracted to black women.
Hand over your weapons.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate that.
It's hard to do.
Swimming is easy for me.

This problem affects us all.
A gang of three robbed the bank in broad daylight.

How can you be sure of that?
Did you just realize that?
I made a couple calls.
Is he Japanese?
It looks great so far.
The weather is terrible today.
I think Tom wants something to write with.
Does this actually make you happy?
We're old friends.
Stop teasing your brother!
Do you really want to talk about that now?
Tom is my son's friend.
Then what's your problem?
Are you happy with that?
Tom seems sincere.
We missed our train.
I don't really understand this.
Tom is John's twin.
"Will he recover soon?" "I'm afraid not."
Who told you the story?
When we started out, our band could only find small clubs in small cities that would hire us.
He's in his late fifties.
One of her three cars is blue and the others are white.
No one's judging you.
That’s what we heard.

Her book is very interesting.
Stop pretending that everything's okay. It's not.

He is a good husband to me.
You're very fortunate.
One of the windows was broken.
Tom wasn't wearing a belt.
"Can I use your car?" "Sure. Go ahead."
I wonder who this is from.
I don't like the taste of this.
We must act.
You're safe.
What did that prove?
Is his father a doctor?
He hit his head on the shelf.
I will be studying when you come at seven.
There's something about this translation that isn't quite right.

How's that going for you?
They'll never make it.
I'm coming right away.
I just don't want to talk to you.
Why don't you and I continue this discussion in private?
I'm a coward.
I will go along with you as far as the station.
He sounds very immature.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
You had better not keep company with him.
The climate is moist and warm.
I'm not leaving the two of you alone.
Do you think I'm ugly?
Let's play a new game.
You may use this car.
At least for now, I'm not going to say anything.
He's not the brightest guy in the world.
I wanted to run away with Tom.
We're very serious.
I feel a little responsible.
We don't have the money.
You may go in now.
Go home quickly.
I couldn't see Tom's face.
Grandmother looked very well.
What do you need a doctor for?

Get some rest.

I don't want to offend you.
This car handles well.

It's no concern of mine.
I never thought you really did that.
What has become of him since then?
Try to be more punctual from now on.
I can't do it today.
Anybody in here?
Thank you very much for everything.
Do you want to eat out tonight?
I don't love you anymore.
Can you point me in the right direction?
I want you to have my land after I die.
I think you should sit down.
I tried to help her.
I'm going to work.
Have you told anyone about this problem?
That's what Tom promised.
He certainly is smart.
She is not so much a singer as a comedian.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
This is your lucky day.
Try again.
She added, as an afterthought, that she was going to do some shopping.
How many combat situations have you been in?
I know I'm wrong.
Aren't you worried it might be a trap?
Is that one of ours?
She altered her old clothes to make them look more fashionable.
It was his job to gather eggs.

I'm from America.
I find that fascinating.
You're not tired, are you?
The car turned to the left.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Tom is in the shower.
Please allow me to go.
We're unrelated.
Tom didn't tell his parents that he had gotten an F on the test.
Are you free tomorrow?
Have a nice trip.
I wasn't born rich.
He can run as fast as you.
She was busy knitting. In the meantime, he was taking a nap by the fire.
Prices rose higher and higher.
How high is it?

The bellows are not working.
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
I'm not good at eating Japanese food with chopsticks.
You'll understand it right away.
I'm loyal.
I really enjoy spending time with you.
The Japanese live in harmony with nature.
Don't buy that.
I don't like who you've become.
I can't remember the last time I ate with my family.
He had taken care of himself.
You're not supposed to do that, are you?
I'm spontaneous.
I can't blame him.
Was he in Hokkaido last year?
Try not to cry.
I cannot praise her enough.
How much is the car you are planning to buy?
I'm very hungry.
If I had taken that plane, I would be dead now.
May I go home?

I will get through with my homework before he comes.

I still think we should've invited Tom to go with us.
Three were wounded.
She got so carried away listening to the Beatles that she missed the date with him.
He is a living fossil!
We are in favor of your plan.
They're not always right.
He turned on the radio.
That's a good thing.
I've met people like that.
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
This is my fate.
I heard my name called.
I will keep on smoking no matter what you say.
I figured I'd be safe here.
I wonder what has made him change his mind.
She picked him up at the station.
Prices are high.
We had a heavy frost this morning.
Do you understand the difficulty of my job?
Tom restrained himself from hitting Mary.
I'm used to working all night.
Isn't this nice?
I know Tom talks about Mary a lot.
They're young and healthy.
We had fun, didn't we?
If you need help, just ask.
We didn't see anybody.
Tom is strong, isn't he?
Riding a horse is a lot of fun.
Don't you want to come inside?
She sat beside me in church.
I rarely go to the movies.
Do you want to say goodbye?
She grew roses.
Tom is a 33-year-old man.
I wanted to help you.
They made me wait for a long time.
She intended to become an actress.
Each of them has a bicycle.
Plants grow.
She tried to persuade him not to decline the offer.
It may sound strange, but what he said is true.
Don't make fun of me.
She must have done it yesterday.
Which one should I use?
That gold ring belonged to my mother.
It's customary for waiters and waitresses to introduce themselves using only their first names.
Get Tom to help you.

We have been up all night.
The effects are not reversible.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
Butter is made from milk.
Shouldn't you go home?
He just cares about himself.
I don't think they heard us.
That'll take a long time.
It was so still that you would have heard a pin drop.
This is just the type of car I want.
I only have one mouth, but I have two ears.
What exactly don't you get?
Tom announced his resignation yesterday.
Your memory is good.
A good team is a group of individuals who work together to achieve a common goal.
You don't kick a man when he's down.
Maybe it would be better not to talk too much about the past.
What are we waiting for?
Were they good?
None of us is perfect.
Tom will stay with us.
I had a nightmare.
I lost my way in the woods.
He wasn't there last week.
He played the piano and she sang.
The baby cannot use a spoon yet.
I'm thinking of visiting you one of these days.
A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car, but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad.

I only drink to be sociable.
Keep quiet!
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
I don't like being inside.
You should've started without me.
My hair is a mess.
Drink something.
How old is your father?
Do you want me to be happy?
She worked hard in order to save money.
I walk to school.

Do you know his name?
Could we discuss this later?

Every rule has its exceptions.
He pinched and scraped for many years to save money.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I can't tell you everything I've been told because I've been told not to.
She happened to know his address.
Up to that time he had been staying with his uncle.
The police are after you.
The address on this parcel is wrong.
I felt bad afterwards.
I tried to imagine life on the moon.
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to lock the door.
There is a right time for everything.
I like meat better than fish.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Is there anything that I can do for you?
Flowers make her happy.
What's the job this time?
I only drink water.
You look gorgeous in that dress.
Why not join us for lunch?
This book is easy for me to read.
I need proof.
There's a new boy in school.
You can't just leave us here with no food and water.
"Do you have any siblings?" "No, I'm an only child."
How's the water?
The storm blew down a tree.
Don't forget to charge your cell phone.
I had a headache.
I've got eyes.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.
He lied to my face.
Tom said you were lonely.
Do you think I'm joking?
I just didn't want to take any chances.
He breathed deeply before entering his boss's office.
What's worrying you?
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
I turned thirty last week.
What should I do to stop hiccoughs?
I study French in addition to English.
Nobody seems to have paid attention to what he said.
Whoever wants it may take it.
I'm not worried about losing my job.
Each of the three boys got a prize.
How do you know all that?
That boy looks like Tom.

What a wonderful night!
The Titanic hit an iceberg.
What is it you want most?
It hurts so much.
You can't keep doing this to yourself.
I don't understand the meaning of the question.
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
Don't scribble here.
You have no taste.
Nobody saw it coming.
"Tom's death was an accident." "Are you sure?"
Tom talked to a lot of people.
What does this hat remind you of?
He asked for more money.
How are you?
I have to paint it.
Keep your head low.
Father showed him into the study.
We broke up.
I didn't fall asleep.
He doesn't have enough experience.
Could you give me some examples?
What are you going to do tonight?
Don't get involved with those people.
What floor do you live on?
You should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive.
I will send it by email this afternoon.
Didn't you know that he passed away about two years ago?
Of course.
I made photocopies.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I don't remember any of their names.
Doesn't that car look familiar?
It looks good on you.
His ideas conflict with mine.
His complaints never cease.
We are his sons.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Are you free for lunch?
Stars were twinkling in the sky.
Do you have a problem?
He has two cars.
The house has burnt down.
She goes to the beauty salon at least once a week.
Are you for real?
Why do you think you're here?

Come on, let's do it.
You don't have to apologize.
I eat in the house.
It is none the less true.
You don't have to be so formal.
My sister is thin, but I'm a little overweight.
I'd love to meet him.
Which is your target?
Things got out of control.
I figured that might be the case.
I'll make you some coffee.
Who are we working for?
Come and see me whenever you are free.
Everyone was pushing, trying to escape.
I want you to explain it to me in more detail.
You don't scare me anymore.
I just don't want any of these.
Give me another chance.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
What will become of me?
He's right behind you.
I'm afraid of the dark.
I'm so tired that I can't walk any longer.
He has a lunch.
Write to Tom.
Our friendship is very important to me.
This is a scam.
You're going to die.
She bought him a dog. However, he was allergic to dogs, so they had to give it away.
I will not do it again.

We're unhappy.
Couldn't they have picked a better time?
I'm not listening.
She was absent from school because she was sick.
You'll find out soon enough.
I'll be on my feet tomorrow.

Six months is a long time to wait.
He is supposed to be at home today.
He has a lot of books on history.
Could you please turn your television down?
I woke you up.
I hope it's not true.
The two boys look more alike than I thought.
I sincerely hope things improve for you.
I didn't realize you were awake.
I copied a passage from the book into my notebook.
She is preparing for college.

Follow us.
Are you busy?

I appreciate all you've done.
I go swimming every chance I get.
I try to keep a low profile.
Please allow me to go.
This is my umbrella, not Tom's.
I do not like the house.
Children can't drink wine.
Do you think you could make it before lunch?

Which is your target?
You should have refused his offer.
He filled the glass with wine.
I was disqualified.
I wish I had seen the film.
I thought we could talk.
Tom needs help now.
I'm not about to ask him.
Please let in some fresh air.
Promise me one more thing.
He married a Canadian girl.
I hate losing.
It is already eleven.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
One of my hobbies is making artificial flowers.
I don't like your girlfriend.
Put this sentence into English.
The store was relatively empty.
They asserted that it was true.
Tom knows a lot of stuff about Mary.
These cups are all broken.
People ask you for criticism, but they only want praise.
Where are they going to?
In my opinion, a well-designed website shouldn't require horizontal scrolling.
He showed us some pictures.
I liked it.
They're free.
If a restaurant has valet parking it's probably pretty expensive.
Life is getting hard these days.
These cars are ours.
She shouldn't go by herself.

What does that sign say?
Did you ever talk to him?
He was one of the unsung heroes of the revolution.
It happened in Rome.
I got a lot of mail this morning.
How much for half a kilo?

I'm not bragging.
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
He will defeat them.
What makes you happy?
Tom is laughing.
I was fortunate to get the job.
It's hard to predict what the weather will be like tomorrow.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
I appreciate your telling me this face-to-face.
Keep looking.
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
You don't want to know.
I couldn't have solved this case without you.
She asked him for some money to buy a new dress.

The fish he caught yesterday is still alive.
Tom ate up all the cookies.
I forgot to shutter the windows before the storm hit.
You may enter now.
You're very curious.
I am ashamed of having been rude to her.
I really see no reason to leave.
I can't let him alone.
I'm glad he liked it.
Who does he look like?
I'll tell everyone what you did.
Do you really think this is a good idea?
It's just wrong.
It is useless to discuss the matter any further.
Unfortunately, it's true.
I got a nasty sting from a wasp.
He sleeps during the day and works at night.
I wish Tom hadn't told Mary about that.
They were both drunk.
It's incredibly powerful.
My sister and I went to the castle.

I want to make it right.
He traveled by boat.
It sounds good to me.
You freaked me out.
The boy denied having stolen the bicycle.
Why don't you sing?
You've got to try this.
It would be a pity if you let this opportunity pass you by.
I saw you.
She acted as if she didn't care what happened.
Why are you asking?
If you dress like that at your age, you'll make a fool of yourself.
I had to do everything by myself.
Somehow I thought you'd say that.
Would you like to see my new car?
We work to earn money.
I would buy it, except that it costs too much.
He's always chasing girls.
Tom does that a lot better than I do.
What's done cannot be undone.
Who would you like to speak with?
Not everything is about you.
It's time for you to buy a new car.
All the money was gone.
Why don't you take a look at this data?
I don't approve your decision.
He has the bad habit of chewing his pencil.
I'm just a plain old office worker.
How about running?
It took me five hours to finish the work.
Is it ready?
She is a very good teacher.
What happens when we run out of water?
We're going to keep smiling.
We used to live in Kobe.
If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it.
That was a crazy thing to do.
I wanted to laugh.
It was a pleasure working with you folks.
Tom was the only one who laughed.
Tom didn't believe Mary.
Are you coming to the party?
You can't stay in here all day.
I succeeded in reaching the top of the mountain.
He lived on crackers and water for three days.
They will be very glad.
He hired a private investigator.
My time is very expensive.
Use your common sense in that kind of a situation.

Let's hope that common sense prevails.
He elbowed his way through the crowd.
It was a long letter.
This is a newspaper.
You should learn from your mistakes.
The priest's cassock billowed gently in the wind.
You can't be sure of that.
Well, here we go.
He's an accredited representative of the Canadian government.
You're tough.
We've had this discussion already.
They were yours.
Why didn't you tell this to the police?
The Sahara is a vast desert.
I owe you something.
Is this all for real?
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
Excuse us for a minute.
I admit that he is right.
He abused our trust.
If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
I'll call you tonight.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
May I take a shower?
It was unlocked.
I want you back.
Isn't it nice?
At what time did the show finish?
Maybe I need a lawyer.
What should I eat?
I don't care what you think.
You can have both.

Go away.
I've had enough.
Do you play soccer or rugby?

I got dealt a bad hand.
The lavishness of the party amazed everybody.
I have a bad toothache.
We can't do this ourselves.
Are you finished?
We've been out of touch with each other for a long time.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
I hope you're happy, too.
You aren't invited.
He and I are such close friends that we can almost read each other's minds.
I will tell him about it when he comes next time.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
May I try it on?
Tom is still dangerous.
I ripped my pants.
I am using a new computer.
He turned out to be innocent.
You must do as I tell you.
When he finished speaking, there was a silence.

Tom knows this is the truth.
First of all, you have to read this book.
I like seafood.
How many did you get?

Do you want another one of these?
She took me by surprise.
I just can't wait.
Thanks for telling me the truth.

Our children all go to the local school.
I had the brakes of my bicycle adjusted.
Why would she go out of her way to help a deadbeat like you?
My uncle made a fortune.
Tom showed Mary John's photo.
I'll need that.
He is fighting with his back against the wall.
Tom's family was also there.

When did you buy it?
This is a mistake.
I don't have to worry about my weight.
Don't rock the boat.
Two teas and a coffee, please.
Don't play ball in this room.
Was the book interesting?
I was too tired to walk any more.
I don't think it'll rain this afternoon.
They despise you.
I haven't got the foggiest notion what you're talking about.
Tom said Mary was happy.
He never gave way to temptation.
The cruel man beat the dog with a whip.
We all worked really hard.
I'm impressed you've done so well.
I'm beginning to lose patience.
He was afraid of his wife.
I'm 25 years old.
She did not listen.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
We have little chance of winning.
There was no one left but me.
That rarely happens.
I am an optimist by nature.
There was nothing I could do about it.
It's not about the money, is it?
I'm a free man.
That's evident.
I do not like science.
Don't tell me you can't read.
I hate this kind of place.
I remember it.
Tom must be wrong.
I wasn't asleep.
I exercise for two hours every day.
Take one of these.
It fits on a single floppy disk.
I'm surprised to see you.
Tom found a job as a mechanic.
I have a friend whose father is an animal doctor.
She likes nothing but the best.
I wish I could help you more.
She is his present wife.
He likes to sing popular songs.

I'm not sure if I'm stupid or not.
Don't give up the fight.
I get more than two hundred emails a day.
Is Tom related to Mary?
She was surprised at his appearance.
Don't raise your voice.
I hope that you will help me.
Why didn't you tell this to the police?

I hate that you have to be here.
Don't tell me to relax.
What do I have to be afraid of?
Tom looks extremely busy.
He flew into a rage.
Can you guys tell us where we are?
You look so pale.
It's all nonsense.
Will you go?
How could I resist?
Do we have enough food?
I didn't know exactly what to say.
I did a little research.
She gathered the pieces of the broken dish.
There's no damage.
Are you all set?
I will survive.
Could you show me how to use this pump?
What's the minimum wage in Australia?
I want to know where you heard that.
I itch everywhere.
He was found mysteriously murdered.
You look like you don't want to be here.
He's the captain of a team.

We're surviving.
You drive a hard bargain.
Their ship struck a rock.
I don't know where the bus stop is.
I went skiing a lot as a kid.
Tom never had that opportunity.
I'm going to need your help on this.
Are you bald?
How'd it work out?
Why did you do this to me?
The baby is in his crib, sucking on his pacifier.
Don't you check your voice mail?
The wedding ceremony will be held regardless of the weather.
It is impossible for you to succeed.

I like the original better than the remix.
This place gives me a really bad vibe.
Tom woke the children up and told them to get ready for school.
You might be interested in this.
I feel bad about what I said.
Who are you going with?
Everything seems to be in order.
Did you find out what time the meeting starts?
He had his shirt on inside out.
I'm running Linux on my laptop.
I'm a professor, or rather an associate professor, to be exact.
She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.

Please make three copies of each page.
That's what you don't understand.
Are there enough chairs?
Don't be too hard on me.
Put out the light.
What was the boy called?
I'm not lying now.
Did you think about our offer?
Would you be willing to write a letter for me?
I know all that.
I couldn't catch what he said.
I have not been studying for two days.
I could use some help in the kitchen.
It takes two hours to go to school by bus and train.
They told me about it.
She still loves him even though he doesn't love her anymore.
Health means everything.
I shouldn't have to do that again.
She turned away and began to cry.
We're not married.
I'll look at it very carefully.
Get in the car.
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Hand in your papers.
Do you really mean it?
You're a nervous wreck.
How long will the storm last?
In a town with only one barber, who shaves the barber?
Tom said he wants to die.
The game was called off on account of the rain.
Tom offered Mary his beer.
I've got little time for reading these days.
In due time, his innocence will be proven.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
I got upset.
I really enjoyed last night.
I don't blame you.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
There's something going on here.
Please leave right away.
You should not go alone.
We managed to swim across the river.
I was threatened.
The radio is a bit loud.
He started to cry.
I need to renew my passport.
When did the wedding take place?
I would really like to know why he did such a thing.
This must be changed.
My camera is different from yours.
Do you think I look like my brother?
You're very generous.
Do you think the accused is really guilty of the crime?
We're really good.
She baked me a cake.
I have been a teacher for 15 years.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
You must overcome the difficulties.
It's almost Christmas.
What are you getting so upset about?
Don't open the present yet.
Yesterday, I bought a red car.
He ran to the station and caught the train.
I doubt that's what really happened.
It is a curse.
He told me good things about you.
Please be sure to turn off the light before you leave.
I love it when that happens.
The cat sat on the mat.
I like your style.
I don't know what I want right now.
I don't like doctors.
It keeps you on your toes.
I just couldn't help myself.
You can go if you want to.
She plans to stay at the Oriental Hotel.
Personal computers are very useful.
Tom wants to open his own restaurant.
Tom didn't actually do anything.
I wish I'd met her.
They stood talking for a long time.
I knew we would find it.
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
It was a very cold winter.
The meeting was held here.
I'd like another beer.
Don't worry about the results.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
We were unable to make contact with them until it was too late.
He quit.
I asked you last night.
Don't make fun of others.
Have any letters arrived for me?
I wonder what I should do today.
Are you a student here?
I do understand.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you wouldn't be late today?
Can you see that small house?
No one will believe you.
You're wasting time.
You should read a book like the one he is reading now.
I don't consider that adequate.
You're not the only one with this problem.
He was late to his own wedding.
How can I help?
They despise you.
I have enjoyed reading this novel.
Get me out of here.
Did anybody see what happened?
I think my plan is better than yours.
I'll handle things.
She was busy doing her homework.
That doesn't happen.
The news of her sudden death came like a bolt from the blue.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
Are you having a good time?
You're sitting in my chair.
I live in Tahiti.
All of us know him well.
Call me this evening.
I'll be grateful to you if you can do that for me.
There's a rock in my shoe.
Nobody invited me to the party.
He has greasy hair.
She is constantly writing letters.
I saw the file.
It used to be that people thought it was necessary to eat three square meals a day.
Are they taking good care of you?
What do you want to drink?
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
Get rid of things you don't use.
I can feel my pulse quickening already.
I almost never listen to the radio.
Are you coming or not?
A moldy loaf of bread lay on the table.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
It's time for bed.
Don't forget to attach your photo to the application form.
Please stop whistling.
I love you the most.
Tom is a lot shorter than I am.
Few people live to be more than a hundred.
Don't call me a jerk.
We listened to his lecture on the radio.
You're off the hook this time.
She was pale with fear.
The climate of Canada is cooler than that of Japan.
It's about time we went back.
He was talking nonsense.
I want another cup of coffee.
I love to party.
It's all part of their strategy.
I have to buy some new shoes.
I refuse.
He took off his coat and put it on again.
The train is traveling at the rate of 50 miles an hour.
We ought to be ready for whatever comes.
The heat is overwhelming.
It was the happiest time of my life.
I can't find my gloves.
I'll buy that old clock no matter how expensive it is.
I sneeze a lot.
Don't push it.
I'm not a hero.
Let's not get that carried away.
He surrendered.
They have to repair their car.
You're such a flirt.
We worked together.
He's stronger than you.
That's better, isn't it?
Tell me what really happened.
Who wants you to be the boss?
There is no other way.
What a big pumpkin!
I have just returned from Britain.
The lady that is speaking to that boy is his teacher.
I know my father will help me.
I've taken care of it.
This pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
Tom didn't come to the last meeting.
It made me forget about my problems.
He loves a banquet, provided he is not expected to make a speech.
You know we don't need to do that.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
I'm ready to throw in the towel.
My school marks were average.
I admire his talent.
I told her what to do.
It couldn't have been better.
This is our last day here.
He apologized profusely.
We still need your help.
I'm creative.
You're very religious, aren't you?
I've lost weight.
I didn't know you could speak French.
Don't say that word.
If he had gotten her advice, he would have succeeded.
I thought you weren't coming.
I'm just not very busy.
Will you explain the rule to me?
How can this be possible?
You can't deny that.
I work every day except for Sundays.
It was quite pleasant.
Life's experiences make vivid records on the sensitive plate of his mind.
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
The river flooded the whole region.
She began to sing.
I'm not one of them.
Among the guests were the mayor and his wife.
I'll see you around.
Where did I put my keys?
I know it's not true.
I can't really complain.
I don't want to step on your toes.
You drink too much coffee.
I am acquainted with the custom.
Keep working.
I have had quite enough of his jokes.
Do you have something that you want to say to me?
I don't remember a thing.
If you eat too much, you'll become fat.
Her composition was free from mistakes.
I wear a suit, but not a tie.
You're the oldest.
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
He spoke well of her son.
Please show me the menu.
Is he all right?
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
Brazil supplies us with much of our coffee.
Hamlet is a play by Shakespeare.
Is the school on this side of the river?
Do you want something?
I don't talk about you behind your back.
I went to drink a beer with friends.
Do you agree with this?
I did just like you asked.
The bus is capable of carrying thirty people.
You like cats, don't you?
Red is better.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow.
Is he a hardworking student?
Don't act like you don't know how to dance.
A drunkard is somebody you don't like and who drinks as much as you do.
Mario is an Italian citizen.
I called him Tom.
That's how it should be.
This is hogwash.
Isn't that an amazing coincidence?
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
Christmas drew near.
What's going on out here?
He memorized that poem when he was five years old.
We always take it easy on Sundays.
We had to put off the meeting.
For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
You had better put on your crash helmet.
What don't you have?
She nodded in response to my question.
They'll try again.
She speaks loudly.
When did the show finish?
I had no choice but to stay.
Do you understand what's going on?
I don't believe that anymore.
You are responsible for what you do.
It's possible that Tom was able to convince Mary to do his laundry for him.
You should've called.
That's what you don't understand.
I'm very disappointed in you.
This is the zoom button.
I've got no quarrel with you two.
Be prepared.
Had it not been for your raincoat, I would have been drenched to the skin.
This custom dates from ancient times.
I refused to pay.
Are you in Boston?
I go where I'm told to go.
Tom comes from a good family.
I found out something.
I'm majoring in sociology.
They've missed the boat.
I wasn't looking at you.
Would you mind if we put this off until tomorrow?
You need to take a break.
I made an appointment to see the doctor at four o'clock.
I was really worried about you.
All they had was one another.
Don't make me say it.
Can you explain why Tom isn't here?
Tea was introduced from China.
Could you turn it down?
I'm feeling stressed.
And then something amazing happened.
I can make it happen.
"Who will be coming to the party?" "A few friends and four or five colleagues."
I stopped listening to the radio.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
Which is your guitar?
If you bite me, I'll bite back.
Tom says he doesn't know where Mary bought her pearl necklace.
Tom fed the horse.
In spite of the storm, he went out.
When did you tell me that?
She visited the old man in the hospital every day but Sunday.
This car is very economical on gas.
The old bridge is in danger of collapse.
Tobacco was one of their major crops.
I only eat kosher food.
He has a few pens.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
I cannot excuse her.
I don't worry about that.
British English differs from American English in many ways.
He's still single.
Answer my question carefully.
What medicine do you recommend?
Think it over and let me know what you decide.
That's your responsibility.
Tom accidentally swallowed a coin.
I know all about you.
Why do you always wear that hat?
She wrote him a long letter, but he didn't read it.
Is that a fact?
Sorry, but can you show me the way to the next village?
It will be very, very hot.
What can you do?
A dog has four legs.
We don't have enough beer.
The Congress had no money.
I didn't want you involved in this.
She didn't want him to play poker.
We look up to Tom as our leader.
We came by to wish you luck.
What made her do so?
Why didn't you call me up?
He let me go.
You're the one who trained me.
Where's the knife?
She likes to go to the library.
Did you put on sunscreen?
I want you to be quiet.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
He is sure to succeed.
Don't light the candle.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
I felt like such an idiot.
It's a waste of time.
We're punctual.
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Do you plan to buy that car?
Say which one you would like.
It's not safe.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
Keep your cigarettes dry.
We had an oral exam.
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise.
It's your only chance.
I'm laying you off.
You're pretty.
It's a good choice.
You can't erase the past.
I have an appointment.
Have you read today's paper?
School begins on April the tenth.
You're fired.
I think I'm falling in love.
We like playing soccer.
He often accuses her of never listening to what he says.
I have to go to work now.
Did I mention that?
Let me make plain what I mean.
Where was it that you found this key?
You can still see the ship.
I appreciate your advice.
You're very rude.
English is taught in a lot of countries.
We had a large audience.
Doesn't it interest you a little?
She advised him to do more exercise.
Call me if you find something.
If you see Tom, please tell him for me.
We have broken off relations with them.
He could not go to college.
She called to tell me that her husband would be out of town for the weekend.
Don't you want something to eat?
We had less snow this winter than we had expected.
I don't particularly care what you think.
I just don't want to say the wrong thing.
You should give up smoking and drinking.
You just need help.
I'm having some problems compiling this software.
We're prisoners.
We sure had fun, didn't we?
Don't you like swimming?
I feel cold this morning.
May I eat this?
You have a fertile imagination.
Sooner or later, the hostages will be set free.
You don't need to go to the dentist's.
Did you find everything you want?
Try this.
You're fair.
Hurry up, please.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Come in for a minute.
Have you been told when to come?
As far as I know, Tom is still married.
I would like to exchange this dress that I bought yesterday.
I quit smoking.
He'll wait for you.
Keep it at a lower temperature.
That sounds very tempting.
You will keep your word, won't you?
I am totally confused.
You heard your mother.
I don't like your smile.
You were fantastic.
How late may I call you?
Keep an eye on him.
I can't eat pork.
Don't leave me here.
Stop acting like a baby.
I rang the bell.
What do they do with all their leisure time?
Tom and Mary value their privacy.
Words cannot convey my feelings.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
I read it in a magazine.
You are a good boy.
Read it once more, please.
How would you like us to proceed?
The news was unbelievably terrible.
They seem happy.
That book is theirs.
The new tax law is full of loopholes.
You're a doll!
I listened to her story.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Logic is obviously your strong point.
His horse jumped over the fence.
She's not here.
The zipper is stuck.
She was advised by him to stop smoking.
I just have a couple of questions.
You're always disagreeing with your boss.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
Tom is a regular customer.
I was thinking of getting one.
He died before I arrived.
He attempted suicide.
I'd like a fork.
I didn't say it happened here.
Do you mind if I open the window?
I'm stronger now.
I don't like this idea.
Tom is really acting strange.
Who said you could speak?
It was really funny.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
I wanted you to see that I'm not all that bad.
Your letter made me happy.
They're just students.
You're talkative.
We talked about what we could do.
I wonder if I should really become a teacher.
I thought it would be an opportunity for you to improve your French.
I don't ever want to hurt you.
You saved us all.
I advise you to stop smoking.
Both are alive.
He is still in bed.
He doesn't stand a chance against his opponent.
My dad died when I was thirteen.
I'll be in touch.
Nobody's in the classroom now.
We don't need to go there.
I wish she were alive now.
Why are we still fighting?
I must have misunderstood.
That guy has a screw loose!
I can't see.
Tom is extremely cautious.
You're very good.
The bird picked up the twig with its beak and flew to its nest.
Was this man threatening you?
You're on to something.
I lit the match.
They make good use of their rooms.
He was hurt in a car accident.
Let's head for that tall tree.
He had the table to himself.
A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.
I think he's lying.
His family dates back to the seventeenth century.
Take this.
I have a few minutes to spare.
She has a husband and two daughters.
Evil always wins.
The boys were injured.
What a big supermarket!
I've been looking all over for you.
She used to drink beer.
Do you need the keys?
What do you call this?
We marveled at the little boy's eloquence.
Tom had never been late for work before.
I will go with you if necessary.
That's not what I want.
He never travels without taking an alarm clock with him.
We've got a mystery to solve.
He told me about the accident as if he had seen it with his own eyes.
Is your father in the garden?
If it is raining, I won't go out tonight.
Things got out of hand.
Don't make me lose my patience.
Did anybody eat with you?
Their answer is yes.
The devil is in the details.
Is it my turn?
Everyone needs to stay focused.
I'm no saint.
I broke up with her.
You saved my life.
His clothes are worn out.
No one knows the answer.
I have some errands to run.
It's a matter of principle.
Does anyone here speak Japanese?
Nanako is really cute, isn't she?
Tom couldn't be happier.
He didn't want to part with his house.
He knows everything about Germany.
I've never seen him in jeans.
I can't possibly allow that.
I wonder if something has happened.
You're silly.
I've learned to cook.
Stay away from us.
I tried to tell you.
Don't stand in my way.
I think Tom may be telling the truth.
I'm calling the cops.
There are many different kinds of beauty.
I have all these apples to carry, not to mention this bag of potatoes.
I was deeply impressed by Roman architecture.
Did she like it?
May I have this dance?
The storm sank the boat.
Do you want to be left out?
You should have shown him the device.
We want Tom.
You'll come back, won't you?
I hate this music.
He is afraid of swimming.
The introduction of the new tax is expected to affect the entire economy.
Don't shout like that. I can hear you perfectly.
Tom took the wrong train.
You don't have the guts.
How did you do?
She did her best to help him.
I lost my wallet on the way to school.
The idea is not new.
If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
They relaxed in front of the fire.
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
I agree with you to a certain extent.
I remember both of you.
Have you ever kissed another guy?
Tom is a professional killer.
You're pathetic.
Have you given any thought to having dinner with me?
She is crying.
I felt the same way.
He has a maid.
My father made me wash the car.
It's a risk we'll have to take.
I don't like to be away too long.
I want to talk to him about it.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
I'm unhappy.
What symptoms do you have?
You're in luck.
The doctor told her that she should take a rest.
She will give you what money she has.
So, are you going to tell me who you are?
I'm no expert.
Take a look.
Can you remember anything?
I'm not sure I'd want to live here.
I don't know what to do right now.
They all laughed at his jokes.
My garden is small.
I'll be presenting a paper at a conference.
Why don't you sing something for me?
Come over to my place.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
I was unable to go to his birthday party.
We can't thank you enough.
He took me for everything I had.
She is trying to prove the existence of ghosts.
His crime is unforgivable.
The princess was beautiful beyond description.
I'm not answering that.
May I borrow your dictionary?
My conscience is clear.
I will go even if it rains.
That is completely useless.
Tom and Mary both have very few friends.
You should go on a diet.
What's your favorite kind of fish?
Where did I put the hammer?
I was very flattered.
What is it with you, anyway?
I finally found my keys.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
Meat is expensive nowadays.
She was looking forward to going to a movie with him.
Tom handed Mary a bottle of water.
This is mine.
It's getting warmer and warmer.
Someone turned the alarm off.
They can raise your rent.
I heard that you became the manager of the Sydney branch.
He came to Berlin as a teacher.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I thought it was stupid.
Tom was unsatisfied with the results.
What kind of fuel do you use in this machine?
Our train arrived on time.
When we entered the shack, we saw a half-eaten pie on the table.
It's not our fault.
Don't pick it up.
You've said enough.
Are you the new teacher?
I like studying wild flowers.
I dance in my living room all the time.
I have been expecting you.
I am expecting some serious work from you.
Whatever you say.
Did you know him well?
I thought it was illegal to park here.
He found me a good job.
Fresh fruit and vegetables are good for your health.
Both spellings are correct.
When will it begin?
I want to know what you're doing here.
Australia is smaller than South America.
This is a joke.
I wake up at 7 o'clock.
I must replace that fluorescent lamp.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
It's a no-brainer.
You're welcome to come with us if you want to.
Go play with Tom.
Anticipating a cold winter, we bought a bigger stove.
Tom is quitting.
We don't need these things.
The teacher allowed him to go home.
I looked for the key.
I lied about it.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
I wonder what Tom would do in a situation like this.
He had nothing to say, so he went away.
The rain began to fall.
Enjoy your trip.
Are you watching your weight?
I'll be a little late today.
How many times a week do you go shopping at a supermarket?
I guess I'd better start packing.
You're too loud.
Tell Tom to stay where he is.
It doesn't matter how small it is.
Did you have any trouble?
I have a good appetite this morning.
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
Look at your map.
I don't want to talk about that right now.
Forget I said anything.
Old people have difficulty understanding modern technology.
I greatly appreciate your kindness.
I really need it.
You look just like your mother.
She started crying.
Did you meet someone else?
You have a kid, don't you?
I'm not sure why they asked me that.
I missed my train.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
That was all Greek to me.
He is carrying out experiments in his laboratory.
I need some sugar. Do you have any?
We're busy.
Over 300 people were arrested.
Bring it back when you're done.
She waits tables for a living.
Go away. I'm busy.
That was really important.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
I had no clue.
I hope someone sees this.
Will he recover?
I know something's going on.
This is just the beginning.
Aren't you dressed yet?
That's good, isn't it?
Do you recognize anyone?
Don't come unless I tell you to.
He went to a single-sex school.
That's right!
It is not polite to point at others.
I cross the railroad tracks every morning.
I never thought you really did that.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
How could you know?
You have done very well.
Thank you for the wonderful dinner.
He started a new life.
The employees are all unionized.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you are happy.
No one's home.
How does she do it?
We're not trying to make amends.
I could kill you now.
Your sweater is on backwards.
Unfortunately, I don't have time today.
They were murdered.
The soup's cold.
I continued reading the book.
After losing his job, he went through a very difficult time.
That hat looks good on you.
The whole thing doesn't make sense.
My German vocabulary list is up to two thousand words now.
I really like these stories.
I am sure of his winning the speech contest.
It didn't really hurt.
He gave it to me.
I'm too tired to think about that now.
We have equipped our office with computers.
I don't think it's a bad thing.
Don't think about stuff like that.
Wives usually outlive husbands.
Don't trust anyone.
The accident was due to his carelessness.
I'll do anything.
Are you a typist?
This is the last time.
I'm freezing cold.
Did you take it?
Can you tell me where the nearest pay phone is?
I like working.
I'm seeing them tonight.
I don't expect you'd remember.
Is there room in your car for me?
This is expensive.
I bought it for ten dollars.
It's really humid, isn't it?
Does it offend you?
None of his advice was very useful.
You deserve to succeed.
I think that's highly unlikely.
I'm not cooking.
What could possibly go wrong?
I thought you'd want to try some Japanese food.
I'll make a pot of coffee.
Tom said we'd find you here.
We're very close.
I love my parents.
Choose any dress you like.
Tom allowed his dog to run free.
It's still in limbo.
I think we can help each other.
Tom took out the garbage.
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
If I were caught, do you know what would happen?
I'm not frightened of ghosts.
I had to get something out of the car.
I know where you hide your diary.
Demand for imported cars is increasing due to lower prices.
The point is, why didn't you tell me?
He should have worked harder.
Where are you?
She hopes to become a designer.
Do you plan to go overseas?
I've been thinking about you, too.
It's a small price to pay.
May I go with you?
Are you American?
I don't feel like it now.
I do want to go with you.
Why were you absent yesterday?
You have a pretty good memory.
I'm on crutches for the next month.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
Apples are sold by the dozen.
The troops had plenty of arms.
They may leave tomorrow.
Has the fever gone down?
I'll make you a new suit.
I don't know much about your family.
I think it's time for me to buy a decent car.
Tom can run faster than you.
I'm glad you're still here.
Our fate is in your hands.
I don't know how this happened again.
Why were you absent yesterday?
Can you see the big white building over there?
That sounds reasonable.
I don't want you to go home.
Tom said he had a slight cold.
We're going to keep doing this until someone tells us that we can't.
I was ushered to my seat.
If he's proficient in English, I'll hire him.
How long did it take you to write this report?
I'd like to get you both to help me.
State your case briefly.
The king and his family live in the royal palace.
She went mad after the death of her son.
Do you have any questions?
Speak your mind.
Was anybody else there?
Tom told me you hit him.
He wondered why she did that.
He's fresh out of college.
You must accept your role.
She became a doctor.
The potato was so hot that it burned my mouth.
I may be too old.
You don't even know who they are.
I just wanted to see what would happen.
Tom stopped me from leaving the classroom.
He's right behind you.
She could pass for twenty.
That will not change.
Tom did something very stupid.
I've already hidden the diamonds.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
Can you believe this is already happening?
I've seen a lot of him recently.
Don't rely on him.
I'm bleeding badly.
We organized a project team.
Who's going to pay for all this?
He is not likely to succeed.
I spent the whole evening reading the poetry of Kenji Miyazawa.
I'm very interested in learning French.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
Tom knew that Mary was trying to do that.
I must go alone.
We listen to music.
Did you pack any snacks?
May I call you tomorrow?
For further information, see page 16.
He forgot her name.
Where are my hat and my gloves?
They are about to start.
Tell me how you solved the problem.
Nobody believes me.
They're doctors.
She seemed disappointed at the result.
They lie all the time.
You have to respect the old.
I'm in way over my head.
Let me go!
How many players are there?
They can't do that.
The unrest lasted three days.
We all laughed.
When will you come back?
It can be fatal.
I'm going to fix some dinner.
We were sailing.
Last year, the company was sold to private investors.
It feels weird, doesn't it?
Why are you staying?
One of the lions has escaped.
I was exhausted.
I miss my parents.
How dare you speak like that?
Wait here. I'll be back soon.
You don't look very strong.
I want to learn how to snowboard.
Which one of those is yours?
He's not in.
I am reading a magazine.
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
Hand in your papers.
What book did you buy?
The driver sustained multiple injuries.
Fold the napkins and put one by each plate.
We were talking about something at that time, but I don't remember what.
Could you help me out a little?
He is at his desk.
They could've killed you.
They were victorious.
How come you don't know your own name?
You didn't have to say yes.
She advised him to go to the police station, but he was afraid to.
I translate articles almost every day.
If it rains, the excursion will be called off.
How will we pay our debts?
He held his breath.
I don't know how much money we've got.
He is French by birth, but he is now a citizen of the USA.
He has come!
My aunt has three children.
You gotta get more organized.
I brought reinforcements.
I can't ask you to take that sort of risk.
All of them were handmade things.
How can you be so sure?
I go to work every day by train.
The soldiers opened fire.
I'm going to send Tom some money.
Could you get in touch with him?
Do you want another one of these?
She looked him right in the eye.
I don't smoke.
You must study more.
That's really great!
Remain seated, please.
They formed a swim team.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
What did you see next?
He demanded that his salary be increased.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
I've been to Hokkaido before.
She emphasized the importance of education.
He cleared out his desk.
We are even.
Don't toy with me, Tom.
You scared the living day lights out of me!
I live in an apartment.
She cut off the carrot tops.
He can't sing.
I am looking forward to your letter.
I can't breath through my nose.
Do you have any money with you?
I'll go change.
Do you want kids?
He won the third prize.
She got up late.
This is his.
I knew you'd be mad.
I want a knife to cut the rope with.
I love apple juice.
He has made me what I am today.
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
He's not like us.
I don't particularly care.
I would rather stay at home than go out on such a cold day.
You might get hurt.
I understand you.
What time did you wake up?
Tom hid under the table.
We're just about finished for the day.
I guess it doesn't make any difference which swimming club I join.
I really wish I knew who painted this picture.
I plan on winning.
A lot of people swim here in the summer.
It was shorter than she expected.
We sure had fun, didn't we?
The bathtub is dirty.
I'll be brief.
You don't have to explain.
I have a friend who can speak French.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
You're very rude.
They will be safe with me.
I had to get out of there.
Nobody would listen to me.
I feel like crying.
It is getting more and more difficult to make a living.
I can't bear it.
We're about the same height.
They caught him playing a trick on his sister.
The newborn chicks still have not opened their eyes.
Generally speaking, boys like girls with long hair.
Legend has it that this house is haunted.
This is by far the best seafood restaurant in this area.
He was born poor, but died a millionaire.
Tom bought a couple of cans of tomatoes.
Tell Tom I'll be there as soon as I can.
We need a victory.
Someone stole all my money.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Tom doesn't want to get his hands dirty.
I can't believe we won.
We have two kids.
I did nothing of the sort.
He was ambassador to the United Nations.
Go back to sleep.
We should let sleeping dogs lie.
The man connected two wires.
I took the liberty of calling her.
Was it a lie when you said you loved me?
She's about the same height as you.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
I thought you were working.
My sister plays the piano every day.
Corn is an important crop in the United States.
You are absolutely right.
I want you to come work for me.
What's the catch?
We're not sure.
Tom doesn't want kids.
Have you called the boss already?
Tom still doesn't understand.
I'm humming.
I have almost no appetite.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner.
Don't make me go back there.
I am ashamed of myself.
Are they in love?
You should not leave the baby alone.
That just goes to prove that you are a liar.
Would you like to have dinner at my place tonight?
Can I offer you a drink?
It was the increase in population that caused the poverty.
I want to live.
I must admit that I don't like contemporary music much.
He is a poet.
That's quite a story.
Tom is smarter than Mary.
How far is it from here to the next village?
Is there anything you can do?
It is amazing that you won the prize.
Because of the snow, the train didn't run.
I don't think I can do anything.
May I go out for a walk?
Do whatever you like.
Do you have everything?
My daughter was taken away from me.
It's irrelevant.
A lot's happened while you've been away.
It was not until yesterday that I knew his name.
I hope you're well rested.
I made an effort to finish my work.
I guess that'll be up to you.
What happened next?
Could I get one more beer, please?
How many guards were there?
Is there anything you want that you don't have?
I've come here to help you.
The age of nuclear power is not yet over.
You killed my mother.
Does anyone speak English?
It looks like she's got a lot of friends.
I hope your brother is better.
Those dogs are big.
Don't you want to know where I was?
This house is uninhabitable.
The surviving refugees longed for freedom.
I thought you did fairly well.
Whatever you say.
Didn't that strike you as odd?
I don't mind if it's hot.
Put yourself in my position.
He began to play an old song.
She gave me a meaningful look.
I want to know who started it.
What would you like for dessert?
Are you kidding?
You won't be needing that again.
I know you love me.
Do you know him at all?
The museum is open from 9 a.m.
Don't let anything stand between you and success.
She lied about her age.
Tom should ask Mary how to do it.
Just as he was going out, there was a great earthquake.
No one I know buys CDs anymore.
He broke in on our conversation.
Who is this letter from?
I brought you this.
Did you hear that?
How often do you shave?
He was alone.
Is that your room?
I'd like to find somebody to talk to.
Every time I go to see him, he is in bed.
When was the last time you dyed your hair?
I had to catch the first train this morning to get here in time.
She'll lend you a book.
Tell me more.
This is the longest novel that I have ever read.
I saw her again.
Parties are fun.
We're freezing.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
It would only be a waste of time.
Did anybody eat with you?
I suppose I'll have to be more careful in the future.
We've all seen that before.

Don't call Tom at his home after 2:30.
Are you here alone?
Are you freaking out?
You hurt me.
Don't tell me you're not scared.
Are you out of your mind?
Nobody deserves that.
I have to alter my clothes because I've lost weight.
How many times a year do you go skiing?
He would not approve.
He works in a big city hospital.
It was hot last night.
I asked Tom to come yesterday, but he didn't come.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
He has three older sisters.
She is an efficient and reliable assistant.
What do you think about this outfit?
I don't like the way she speaks.
My wife is a good manager.
Thank you for stopping by.
We put up the flags on national holidays.
She insisted on helping me.
One day, all this will become yours.
This isn't enough.
I know that wasn't the answer you wanted.
I want to play the guitar.
Are there kids?
Perhaps you would have preferred a French dish.
Tell me what your name is.
Can I interest you in a game of cards?
The president's son leads the special forces.
I hope you won't be disappointed.
What time do you have supper?
Would you all relax?
Keep the secret.
I can barely stand his behavior.
Tom likes to climb the trees.
We were not prepared for the assault.
I want time.
Tom fainted at the sight of the needle.
Thanks for coming.
We count on you.
Excuse me, but would you please open the window?
I heard the children's happy voices.
She grows tomatoes in her garden.
You don't care about me.
I'm feeling confused.
One language is never enough.
There's milk in the fridge.
I want to know more about your school life.
Be nice.
She was falsely accused.
I want to know why this happened.
Is it an action movie?
I don't agree with this.
Why don't you sit down?
Tom's arm brushed against mine.
Tom doesn't like being told he's not old enough yet.
Can you see it?
You like Boston, don't you?
We're not here to talk about music, Tom.
I really don't need any help.
Your feet will lead you to where your heart is.
I am a student.
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?
I feel much safer now.
I don't know what that is.
Come down from the tree.
I must have made a mistake.
I'm not wasting my time.
How did you come up with that answer?
I accomplished what I wanted to.
The cat was licking its paws.
He gave the child a toy.
It will only hurt a little.
I was just going to work.
Can you spell it?
Mother advised me to take a walk for a change.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
We've seen her.
You'll strain your eyes trying to read in this light.
I'm thin.
I just cleaned all the tables.
We discussed the matter from an educational point of view.
Don't make me lose my patience.
We must keep calm.
That's not very nice.
Would you like to go camping with us next weekend?
That's what I told him.
Why are you alone?
Sugar is soluble in water.
I'm very glad I wasn't there.
I grasped the rope so as not to fall.
He would often sit for hours without doing anything.
You don't even know why I'm here.
I know you feel sad.
Everything is now back to normal.
Tom took a lot of pictures.
Tom sometimes walks to school.
Do you want to make a deal?
Can you watch my dog while I’m away?
They knocked on the door and said they had come to arrest him.
They are not my real parents.
He visited Kyoto last year.
Lock the door when you go out.
Those standing were all men.
Where did you get on this bus?
I haven't decided.
I know where they're taking Tom.
Smoking is harmful to the health.
She took her ring off and threw it at him.
I suppose that's allowed.
She left her umbrella in the train.
I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.
I'm going to go to the kitchen to grab something to eat.
Have you given any thought to having dinner with me?
Let's begin with the first chapter.

He can't swim.
It's too dark to play baseball now.

I'm not a good liar.
I've lost my best friend.
Sea turtles have a long lifespan.
She forgave him for killing her father.
She was too short to see over the fence.
Let's continue working together to make that happen.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
She was going up a ladder.
All right, I'll do it.
I met an old friend of mine.
What options do I have left?
He hit his head against a rock.
One of them is a spy.
You're very timid.
I loved that.
It's right above you.
I cannot agree to his proposal.
It was colder yesterday than today.
I slept well last night.
I want to see you in my office.
It's a sequel.
You're the teacher.
I am ready to do anything for you.
He was sitting next to me.
She watched him draw a picture.
Write at least 250 words.
I don't think I can get you to understand how difficult that is.
How long do I have to stay here?
I made myself a cup of hot chocolate.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
He felt himself growing old.
May I come and see you tomorrow?
How do you know they're looking for us?
I presented him with a gold watch.

Can you fix this or should I call a plumber?
Election day was cold and rainy.
Tom probably thought I wasn't at home.
The car's tires were caked with dried mud.
Follow me. I'll show you how to get out of here.
Drop the gun.
Everyone needs friends.
Who's here with you?
I can cook better than I can play tennis.
I just have a lot on my mind.
I am tired of the day-to-day routine of life.
He kept it secret.
Do you have any travelers' checks?
I just don't want any of these.
I would rather throw the money away than give it to him.
You're too slow.
We have guests.
I'll do all the talking.
Our only daughter died of cancer.
I can't trust what she says.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Is this your beer?
My hair is as long as Tom's.
It was fun while it lasted.
Tom was in almost every picture in Mary's album.
The sky turned dark.
Try not to look so nervous.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
They fell into each other's arms.
You do seem a little on edge.
His brother passed away last month.
I was frightened.

No person achieves success or happiness when compelled to do what he naturally dislikes to do.

I have few books.
You're not good at this.
I can't believe you said that.
Do you have a plan?
I know she is sleeping.
There isn't any milk left.

You look Japanese.
He was accused of evading tax.

You're not the only one who feels that way.
He said he could swim well.
Tom is on life support.
Can you describe it?
We are on the way home.
Why are you questioning me?
We are not alone.

They can't hear you.
Honesty pays in the long run.
I want your name and badge number.

I exaggerated.
Where did you find the keys?
Come to me.
I slept very well.
Tell me all the details.

That's a tower.
She choked him.
You can't bury your head in the sand.
Tom looked back.
You're so impatient.
I think it's not going to be that hard.

I thought he would be upset.
Have a donut.

How may I help you?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.

I want this to be yours.
Tomorrow night, I am going to Narita airport.

Did I give it to you?
I want to hold your hand.
I didn't really enjoy that.
They looked relieved.
Tom got up to help Mary.
How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
Are you for or against the bill?
The volcano has erupted twice this year.
She was unwilling to tell her name.
Do you have psychic powers?
I would sooner die than give up.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
It's older than that.
I live three doors down.
I want to be here with you.
I've explained all of this to you before.
Take care of yourself.
It's not the same anymore.
It's all clear.
I'll obey.
Lake Baikal in Russia is the deepest lake in the world.
I was very, very lucky.
You don't have the nerve.
Is Tom from Boston?
The battery on my cell phone is running low.
He's taking a shower.
She hired him as an interpreter.
I'm all done.
He was listening to music in his room.
Please help yourself to the cake.
I had to decline his offer.
They had an argument.
He was supposed to come.
I don't know why I bother repeating myself.
These are the people who live next door.
I feel like I'm going to be OK.
That was ours.
You can't just not do your job.
Love makes the world go round.
They don't make them like they used to.
I like where I live.
Where do you work?
He got the job.
We hope to reach the summit before it gets dark.
I got this bicycle for free.
You should have done so.
How did you come by this painting?
All three of us agree.
I guess that'll be up to you.
Who will write the report?
You'll never want what they want.
I didn't flunk.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
Blood spatter analysis plays an important role in determining what has happened at a crime scene.
You're a liar.
You read too much.
He asked me if I were happy.
Even if it takes me ten years, I am determined to accomplish the job.
It's old and clunky.
Have you ever cheated on an exam?
She is no ordinary student.
You're winning, aren't you?
Can I have one?
I really can't figure it out.
My hair is a mess.
He died yesterday.
What woke you up?
I'll take attendance first.
We need our demands to be met.
Look who's talking.
Against all expectations, we became good friends.
It looks like you've got a green thumb.
I'm still here.
Are you blackmailing me?
I'd say you did well.
The train for Birmingham leaves from platform 3.
Can I have this dance?
We were shocked at the news of his death.
You need to be more patient.
I like to be with my classmates.
Tom looked at the floor.
I was ashamed of what I had done to my benefactor.
I had no idea you could dance.
What did you see?
Here comes our teacher.
I didn't want to help Tom.
It's important that you hear this.
Quit acting like a baby.
It's not cold today.
I want this bag.
That is the office where he works.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
Now she understands what I mean.
I had a hunch you would do that.
Tom certainly doesn't seem to mind helping Mary.
I'm incredibly busy.
I saw my sister there.
If only she were to help, the job would be finished sooner.
He denied himself nothing.
Some large birds prey upon small birds and animals.
I'm not giving up yet.
I saw it coming.
We happened to meet at the station.
I don't think Tom will be at school tomorrow.
I need someone who I can talk to.
I hung my coat in the hall closet.
Are all these books yours?
I've been misunderstood.
Your phone's ringing.
I really enjoyed last night.
Do you live in this dorm?
Please hurry.
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.
You really annoy me.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I never mentioned it again.
She had never been so proud of herself.
I just showered.
Tell me what you saw.
Am I supposed to thank you?
Each child was given a present.
Do you like it then?
I'm not buying you another drink until you say sorry.
I didn't know that you used to work here.
I haven't seen you for a while.
This week I had three midterms.
The Chinese are a hard-working people.
I'll work alone.

Please give me a break.
I dove into the river.
He is still sitting on the bench.
Why do you want to work for our company?
She is married to a foreigner.
We want to have a large family.
Did you have fun tonight?
I had that weird dream again last night.
Who will you give the book to?
I flunked out of school.
She was hurt in the accident.
There was only one survivor of the accident.

Tom isn't the same age as Mary.
I feel lost without you.
Monday's protests were mostly peaceful.
Are you joking?
Tom has three sisters.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
I saw the match on television.
He is taking a walk.
He played the guitar and she played the piano.
We have to save him immediately.
There is something about him I don't like.
People are stupid.
It goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health.
I stayed home all day.
It's going to clear up soon.
There is enough time to finish this homework.
What just happened?
Didn't you feel like going?
I'm not advocating that.
Some days seem to just drag on and last forever.
You're forgetful.
He was killed in a car accident.
I brought a jacket because it was quite cool this morning.
Cutting a cake into equal pieces is rather difficult.

He came by bus.
I just want to be clear.
Tom's lunch includes a sandwich and an apple.
I want to have a word with Tom.
It's an American company.
My sister is suffering from a bad cold.
Let me do that.
Do you want in or not?
Keep in mind what I tell you.
I'm not living with him anymore.
I love hiking.
Water conducts of electricity.
The two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
Be friendly.
Long time, no see.

You're fascinating.
I no longer want that.
They shared the money.
Do you want some breakfast?

The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
Just then I heard footsteps in the stairwell.

I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
That was mentioned.
He is a gentleman.
She dropped out of school.
The door was difficult to open.
The door remained closed.
It is a very sad tale.
"This looks pretty interesting," Hiroshi says.
What if they don't like me?
We've missed the boat.
They did not have enough gold.
I haven't been sleeping very much lately.
I was not drinking.
They've all left.
He told me all the details.
He hid himself behind a large rock.
What is it that you want?
How much is that?
We will accept your conditions.
What were you doing at that time?
He is not as smart as his older brother.
This tree is more than a century old.
I can't understand anything he said.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
I think that my German is really bad.
I don't like being controlled.
I think you have a problem, Tom.
We love our country.
We've run enough for one day.
Don't be so pessimistic.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
Someone broke my camera.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
This tea smells good.
We talked.
No one is home.
These are his pens.
I didn't think you needed one.
The shower is broken.
Don't bite your nails.
Tom tried to lift the box.
Doesn't it smell like bacon?
He showed us a few pictures.
Some of them were wounded.
No way!
They each received a present.
No one was there.
I tried to warn everyone.
Tell me what you did in Hawaii.
I had no idea you'd be here.
Put down your weapons!
Divide this line into twenty equal parts.
Why aren't you listening to me?
I couldn't bring myself to throw your picture away.
Are you looking for me?
I love this part.
We demanded that she should make up for the loss.
What lovely weather!
She's busy now and can't talk with you.
What's going on?
We're unhappy.
I hope things will get better.
Until that day, I had never eaten dog meat.
Whether you like it or not, you have to do your homework.
He was attracted to the woman.
Is this your DVD?
Did you open all the boxes?

I thought we had until 2:30 to finish this.
Be merciful.
Is this the place where your mother works?
No one wants to talk about books anymore.
The vast majority of children love ice cream.
Seoul is the capitаl of South Korea.
I feel like such a fool.
I truly didn't know you felt this way.
Tom commutes to school by bicycle.
I want you to do it at once.
We were excited as we watched the game.
My hobby is music.
Is your baby sleeping?
Tell me a little bit about yourself.
The idea isn't bad.
I am glad to help you.
I know you were born in Boston.
Hold your position.
Laughter is good for your health.
I had my doubts about you.
I don't believe in fairy tales.
Are you talking shop?
Some believe Nessie lives in this lake.
I've never been here before.
I do not like both of them.
That was so cool.
Why wasn't Tom there?
Am I dying?
That was a close call.
It isn't safe for us to remain in this area.
Could I get my ring back?
What a night!
You're not that smart.
You don't want to be an editor?
What are you two conspiring about?
How is this possible?
They're all against me.
This can't be the way to do it.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
Quit complaining.
Everyone looked at him like he was crazy.
Tom is married to Mary.
Don't give him any ideas.
I regret this decision already.
Tom says he regrets doing that.
We caught you.
It's a complicated subject.
I think we could help each other.
I could never do that sort of thing.
Everything happens for a reason.
There's something fishy going on.
I will go if you go.
That meal was simply divine.
Is Tom very mad at me?
Don't play dumb!
Are we likely to arrive in time?
Tom was surprised by Mary's reaction.
It's Wednesday.
Because of the poor harvest, wheat prices have gone up in the last six months.
Let's let the workers go home early today.
Call me if anything changes.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
What kind of car do you drive?
She shot him.
Your face is familiar to me.
This letter was never meant to be sent.
The opening ceremony took place yesterday.
I don't know how much time I've got.
No pain, no gain!
He was sent into combat.
I ate lunch in a hurry.
He looks older than my brother.
This is my coach.
Who was this picture painted by?
Time is more precious than anything else.
Ignore him.
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.
I've been all over.
I need to get my oboe repaired.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
The colonists bartered with the natives for fur.
That isn't exactly what I said.
They probably don't know.
We eat fish raw.
My ideas are different from yours.
You're all I've got.
I want to eat a steak.
Let me know what you're up to.
The roses are in bloom in our garden.
Find out where Tom is.
Simplicity is a virtue.
I'll be back within an hour.
At 10 o'clock yesterday, there were hundreds of people outside.
Let's not be in too much of a hurry.
I think Tom's here.
There's something I feel you should know.
I feel like I could cry.
She has no opinion about religion.
How do you spell your family name?
I've got a job and I don't want to lose it.
He is there for a few days.
We have to consider the problem in the light of cultural differences.
This is an apple tree.
Our new method of doing that is quicker and more efficient.
She had her heavy suitcase carried by the porter.
Tom isn't going to listen.
You want something from me, don't you?
You've hurt me a lot.
She pulled him out of the mud.
For all her riches, she's not happy.
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
She made it clear that she couldn't make it in time for the meeting.
I had been reading for an hour.
Don't ask such hard questions.
Hand me a towel.
Let me explain.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
That sounds credible, doesn't it?
Please inform me of any changes in the situation.
Plants take in water from the soil.
I really like your work.
It's somebody else's turn.
I refuse to listen to your excuses.
His house is at the foot of Mt. Fuji.
There's nothing left for me here.
Where is the most beautiful place in the world?
Would you like to eat something?
I hate this school.
She is on friendly terms with him.
She looks pretty no matter what she wears.
She stood bolt upright.
I'll keep you posted.
She has a wonderful personality.
She looks happiest when she is with him.
You have the right to free speech, but not the right to slander.
You're probably tired.
We promised.
We must take care of our planet, the earth.
Maybe I drink too much.
I understand it, but I still don't agree with it.
Can't he ride a bicycle?
He lives in a cozy little house.
I want to do it myself.
I am folding my dress.
His unusual behavior aroused our suspicion.
I misspelled the word.
You're feeling very sleepy, aren't you?
Let's do this first of all.
They gave up.
I don't really know you.
I'd like to buy eye drops.
How many pennies does it take to make one pound?
I have to admit that you're right.
I'm in no mood to argue politics right now.
Is he nice to her?
Will I be able to find it?
Mother bakes cookies on Sundays.
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
We were ambushed.
I feel queasy.
I never do any exercise.
I just don't want to let you down.
I'll look after your child while you are away.
We are all convinced of his innocence.
Are these yours?
I'm a coward.
I want you to be my partner.
Which one do you prefer, the red one or the blue one?
I work two jobs.

Salmon can jump up to 12 feet high.

I just had this suit cleaned.
We're not convinced yet.
He was surprised at the sight of blood.
You'd better wear a sweater under your jacket.
He left me the keys.
I didn't have lunch today.
Tell me where you went.
I don't have them yet.
It might be enough.
How old are you now?
The family moved from their native Germany to Chicago around the year 1830.
We're useless.
I don't know you anymore.
Tom lives in a small town not too far from Boston.
I'm being held hostage.
Are we going far?
I'd like to go out with you.
I blew the candle out.
That would be nice if it were true.
You're nuts!
The influence of TV on society is great.
Tom has enough money to buy any computer in this store. He just needs to decide which one.
Do you understand her?
Tom remembers you.
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
How can this be done?
Don't eat the oysters.
I'm happy for you both.
She's digging her own grave.
Doesn't it interest you a little?
He was visibly nervous.
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
He told the children about his adventures in Africa.
I don't like your boss.
They want to kill me.
I'll have you committed.
Be serious.
Is it harder to forgive or to forget?

Your daughter is very pretty.
I didn't even see you once last year.
I found it difficult to keep a diary every day.
They drive on the left in England.
I took a taxi from the station to the hotel.
Be polite to everyone.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
What an idiot I was to lend her money.
I want us not to get caught.
My mother has gone shopping.
I think you are the one who broke it.
At what point do we start to worry?
He was intrigued.
He is a heroin addict.
I'm sorry about last night.
I like candlelight.
He has a sweet voice.
I had the feeling you were going to ask me that.
I'd rather go for a walk than see the movie.
Will you take a personal check?
I was surprised.
I love movies.
The trouble is that I have no money with me.
Do you think that Tom is happy?
I want to live in a world where people love one another.
I want to try something else.
You must study grammar more.
Didn't anyone tell you?
Judging from what you say, he must be a great scholar.
Everybody started to leave.
You can't deny that.
Tom slammed down the phone.
She was asked not to speak at the meeting.
Strange things happened in that house.
The crane, unlike the dog, has never dreamed of flying.
I didn't kill Tom.
I'm an engineer.
Is that your car?
I wonder what's in the box.
I got paid today.
Tom is an old man.
What part of Australia do you come from?
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
I know your father very well.
You're still mad, aren't you?
I just want to know how far we're going.
You're surrounded.
What happened in here?
I'm not stopping you.
You have to begin as soon as possible.
How do you deal with it?
A heavy snow kept us from going to school.
We can't take the risk.
I didn't realize you were serious.
Was it a lie when you said you loved me?
What are you staring at?
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
This room has air conditioning.
I like to travel alone.
I don't think I was followed.
That's icky.
Where do you live?
Have a donut.
He changed schools last year.
I want them to be your friends.
He walked away.
Don't ever lie to me again.
You're a bad liar.
Tom pressed a hidden button.
You must think I'm really strange.
I live in Hyogo.
I tried to save you.
Please help me take this lid off.
He's handsome and charming.
I knew they were your friends.
I found this book interesting from start to finish.
This is by far the best way.
I got remarried.
Water is leaking into my goggles. I don't think they fit right.
Do me a favor.
Please continue until I tell you to stop.
We're a couple.
You don't want to be an editor?
You must not jump to conclusions.
You won't need that.
I am poor at swimming.
Can I count on your loyalty?
When they finally found him, it was too late.
You'll never escape that way.
To each his own.
I wish they would stop fighting.
He looked at me in surprise.
Who will compensate for the loss?
You don't have to respond.
I want you to open the window.
That was just another party.
She blamed her failure on bad luck.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
Don't be cruel to animals.
We want to break off this negotiation.
I have lots of things to do.
Tom said he couldn't remember his own phone number.
Let me think this over.
They tried to discourage him from going.
I'd better call you back.
You have to eat before you go.
I want to learn to sing like you.
How long can I keep this book?
I never thought that would happen.
His parents expect too much of him.
Let's replace all of them.
You have beautiful hands.
I was disgusted.
I haven't read both of his novels.
I wholeheartedly agree.
I'm all done.
I don't know what's happened.
Who ate all the cookies?
You'll strain your eyes trying to read in this light.
The pond has dried up.
We got married three years ago.
A broken mirror brings bad luck.
She looked at him with a smile on her face.
She is completely deaf in her left ear.
Careful driving prevents accidents.
Do it delicately.
You can't just walk in here.
He comes here twice a week.
I hate that you have to leave.
Did you say 30?
I was off duty at the time.
If you eat at this time of night, you'll get fat.
Don't you want to help?
You don't have to answer.
Do you want to dance?
Show me another watch.
I feel trapped.
The next day, at suppertime, I was introduced to her husband.
It is very cold today.
Both of them seem suspicious.
She turned the doorknob slowly.
He is as smart as any other boy in the class.
This is the right answer.
Tom returned from the kitchen with two mugs of coffee and sat down next to Mary.
Your answer differs from mine.
It's not the answer.
You are on the wrong plane.
What were you thinking of?
I have proof.
I don't know the way.
Tom isn't a doctor.
Is it far?
I don't like it when you do that.
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
What a lot of pens!
The girls won.
You gotta get more organized.
I don't regret doing that.
We count on you.
I love looking at everyone's colorful kimonos on Coming of Age Day.
She's waiting for you at home.
I advised him to give up smoking.
I am tired of hearing it.
Have you done this before?
She has never sung a song with him.
Police are urging people not to pick up hitchhikers as they search for two prisoners on the run after escaping from jail.
A noise woke her up.
I'm tough.
I had some cash stashed away.
It just makes no sense.
I want to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
He hates running.
I'm surprised to see you.
I have enough money to buy it.
They had fun with us.
Tom's good at his job.
I was curious.
He must be over fifty.
I have some doubts about his coming in this weather.
How old are your children?
I think you're nuts.
Do as you want.
We will take care of this for you.
My mother and father aren't home right now.
Boy was I wrong.
You've got everything you need.
Three hours is a long time to wait.
I should do it.
I have enclosed your order form.
I baked it for you.
I felt threatened.
Try to open the door.
Bad news travels quickly.
I really appreciate you helping me.
This is strictly a private matter.
Everybody in the picture is smiling.
Keep your head low.
Tokyo is a very big city.
I told you to stay away from me.
I don't want to spend any more time than necessary cleaning the house.
How's your day going?
Were you busy?
We won.
He has the habit of scratching his head.
She left the room.
That's what I want most in the world.
There is nothing for you to be afraid of.
Autumn came and the leaves started to fall.
You would make a great mother.
I want to know what's so funny.
The drawer won't open.
I'm sort of an introvert.
The blood stain can't be removed.
We didn't look very long.
You leave me no choice.
I destroyed all the evidence.
You need to move on.
He bought us some drinks.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
I recommended Tom for the job.
I need you to do me a favor.
Who did you go there with?
I didn't think you'd come back.
I heard him go down the stairs.
I wonder if it will clear up tomorrow.
I really don't feel like talking right now.
My son likes to play with cars.
I have a throbbing pain here.
I did try to warn you.
I want to take you to lunch.
She threw her hands up in horror when she saw what he had done.
All my friends like the same kind of music that I do.
Don't ask me such a hard question.
Sometimes it's better to just not say anything.
You're not the first.
That's the way he likes it.
You've risked enough.
Is everyone here?
I know Tom and Mary used to be friends.
I rewrote it.
Both of them seem suspicious.
She asked him to help her father clean the garage, but he said that he was too busy to help.
We're not getting any younger.
I'm not a teacher.
I'm fine with it.
I don't know how old Tom is.
No one else could do my work.
Will you show me your passport, please?
Tom's drowning.
You can't do both at the same time.
He was charged with conspiracy.
I am shorter than you.
I want you to get me a soda.
I'm only three years older than he is.
Excuse me, but do you mind if ask your name?
How do I change my cell phone's ringtone?
What is your date of birth?
Please turn off your engine.
She feeds her dog the same thing that she eats.
I told Tom to take off his shoes.
I had a crush on you when I was twelve.
I didn't like this game until I started winning.
Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.
Isn't that awful?
Now that he has gone, we miss him very much.
Are you hungry at all?
I don't want to see it.
She promised to marry him, but she didn't.
Tom must be proud of you.
What is the book about?
I read the whole book in one day.
I really wanted to go.
You'll find yourself in a miserable situation.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
They're not evil.
No, I didn't go.
No one knew who did it.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Help me.
She weeded the garden.
These shoes don't fit my feet.
It sounds simple.
Are you certain about this?
I've never hit anyone in my life.
She adores him.
Don't light the candle.
His head ached.
Your English has improved a lot.
What nonsense are you talking now?
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
My watch keeps good time.
Agriculture is an important industry in California.
They're cute.
He stopped to talk to them.
We're not staying.
I would have written a longer letter if I'd had more time.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I'd like some shoes.
The boy fell off the bed.
We saw laborers blasting rocks.
Would you play with me?
He sacrificed everything for you.
I do this all the time!
She went shopping.
You must have forgotten them at the office.
Bring me some water.
Think it over and tell me what you decide.
How did you burn your hand?
She walked very carefully.
Will I be able to find it?
I want an hourly update about what's happening.
I really am sorry.
Be quiet for a moment.
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
This is so easy.
You should spend a little time each day reviewing vocabulary.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
I'm certainly not your friend.
I was thinking of getting one.
Write on every other line.
I will help you when I have finished my work.
I can do it.
You've worked hard.
I have already read the book.
What would you like to do?
Hop in.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
You have been warned.
To the best of my knowledge, the rumor is not true.
He is a clever boy.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
This is the worst book I've ever read.
Have you finished writing your composition?
Is that what you think I want to hear?
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I feel like I'm not wanted.
I can speak English.
Can eating just vegetables help you lose weight?
He can pull strings for you.
Since there was no taxi, I had to walk home.
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
It's too hot.
They plan to get married tomorrow.
Have you eaten breakfast yet?
I got scammed.
Did I forget anyone?
What's the most convenient way to get to Tokyo Station?
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
She owes him a lot of money.
What have we gotten into?
I can't see the road signs in this fog.
Did you have fun last night?
I'm sick of this game.
We moved into a new house.
He won't leave us alone.
This room is too big.
You're very talented.
Where is your father?
Don't let him know the truth.
The cap is too small for me.
The call is free of charge.
We'll always remember Tom.
They looked very happy.
Leave it to the professionals.
She doesn't know how to drive a car.
I'll be seeing him tomorrow.
I want you to sit with me.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
We're married to each other.
He is related to me by marriage.
You can't hold that against me.
I'm thinking of learning Korean next semester.
Would you like to go have a drink?
Walk this way.
My father is in the garden.
If you listen closely enough you'll be able to hear it.
I refused to pay.
I thought you'd ask about that.
We're unlucky.
He'll never forgive me.
Leave her alone.
I think we need more water.
Where are you going?
I love my kids.
Tom asked Mary whether she'd like to go shopping.
We are watching.
He filed a complaint.
The weather was ideal.
I have another job now.
She wants to attend the party.
She can't stand being treated like a child.
I'm using that cup.
I'm not sure what you were thinking.
I didn't see you come in.
So what is it you want me to do?
He continued to mock me.
No one's perfect.
I'm glad I invited you.
I think it will rain today.
I've never stolen anything from Tom.
I'll protect you.
Are you retired, Tom?
My car is at your disposal.
She asked me for help.
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
She is very kind to us.
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
You gave me your word.
What are you looking at?
I wouldn't count on it.
I got bored.
I wish I was kidding.
This is between you and me.
If it doesn't rain soon, our garden is going to dry up.
We're dying.
Do you have any French newspapers?
Don't waste your time.
You should look up this word.
Do you have any cash?
She can't do that.
Tom didn't want to continue the conversation.
Is this your car?
There is a television in this room.
What caused the explosion?
The two answers are both correct.
His laptop is already five years old.
I'll let you get back to work.
My father works in a factory.
This lawn mower runs on gasoline.
Tom tightened the knot.
She asked him to marry her.
I was unable to go to his birthday party.
You'll like it, believe me.
You gotta get more organized.
Why are you all here?
My home is far away.
I don't believe it any longer.
I don't think I can help you.
Could I get you to update this data for me?
This will only take a second.
We've decided to move the meeting to next Sunday.
I loved that dog.
If you spend too much time in the sun without putting on sunscreen, you are likely to get a sunburn.
We need to get rid of Tom.
I'm not a cat person.
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
Where are your credit cards?
Tom tried to open the door, but he couldn't.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
I really didn't want to play.
Being deeply thankful, he tried to express his thanks.
I followed you.
Dragons are imaginary animals.
Add 5 to 3 and you have 8.
Can we afford a new car?
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
I'm sick of this war.
The waiters bumped into each other and dropped their trays.
What is the second largest country in the world?
Please wait outside the house.
Toward midnight, I fell asleep.
He has no real friends.
Is it an elk?
Are you saying I have no sense of humor?
You're the leader.
I don't like people looking at me.
You must be exhausted.
My dog is dreaming of a cat.
Nothing is planned.
She is in need of help.
This is the fifth concert by this orchestra.
Just ignore it.
He shook hands with his friend.
It's still too hard to find a job. And even if you have a job, chances are you're having a tougher time paying the rising costs of everything from groceries to gas.
Recently there have been a lot of protests in the city.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
I made that one.
I've always loved you.
He loves toys.
Her speech was excellent.
They won't make it.
I guess you are right.
I have read the book.
Is there anything that I should not eat?
I have no objection.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
Can eating just vegetables help you lose weight?
I want to fly above the clouds.
His name is known all over the country.
Are you really that stupid?
I can't believe that you were the smartest kid in your class.
I hate to lose.
He knows how to drive a car.
I think you need some rest.
Do I look dead to you?
He gets a haircut three times a month.
Why does it make you angry?
I question your choices.
I like to talk.
Go to your room!
You look so beautiful.
I didn't like my teacher.
He's ruthless.
He arrived at the station out of breath.
Let's go this way.
Keep me informed.
Suppressing one's romantic feelings is not the same as having no such feelings.
I don't know French that well.
I took an early flight home.
All I want for Christmas is a guitar.
Was I not supposed to eat yet?
That's not quite right.
She doesn't like sushi.
I never thought it'd be this hard to choose a color to paint the kitchen.
Was that word appropriate in that situation?
Don't you feel anything?
Any of you can do it.
I don't want people to hate me.
You should not go there.
I don't regret what happened last night.
Why did it take so long?
I'd like stay longer, but I have to leave.
I had expected him at the meeting.
This is a great theory.
I will take the one that is more expensive.
Please tell me what happened.
Where's the newspaper?
What's my room number?
Old people need something to live for.
Our whole case hinges on whether the government's actions were constitutional or not.
She is obstinate.
We are busy people.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.

I was born in Boston in 1995.
This is a major crisis.
I really don't have anything else to say.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
He spent another sleepless night watching television.
You must be blind as a bat if you couldn't see it.
Tom sliced the tomatoes.
How can this be true?
Nobody can stop it.
I'd like to ask you some questions now.
I'm really hungry. I haven't eaten all week.
I ran into an old friend of mine outside the station.
I'm very glad to see you again.
They want you dead.
You are taller than me.
I thought you were older than me.
I just want to be your friend.
I can't be bothered to go out tonight.
Are these for sale?
I wasn't following the conversation.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Of all these books, this is by far the best on China.
I'm famous.
The nurses were very nice to me.
She is dressed like a bride.
I'd like you to look after my dog.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
He can't speak English.
Japan does a lot of trade with the USA.
I'll tell Tom what a great job you did.
Is that bothering you?
We have a traitor among us.
Would you show us some samples of your work?
Today didn't go well.
I wasn't that smart in school.
Our price is considerably higher than the current market price.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
I already have plans for this weekend.
Tom did nothing illegal.
I will be leaving for Australia next month.
I think we may have met somewhere before.
You're depressed, aren't you?
We promised to stand by him in case of trouble.
I want to know who sent you.
Please write with a pen.
I just don't like getting left behind.
Don't make the same mistake twice.
He accepted my present.
You can't trust anything he says.
We are all happy to help.

You can't do this to yourself.
He is fortunate having such a good wife.
She accused him of having lied to her.
He's a good boy.
How did you become involved in this project?
I'm impatient.
I don't remember getting paid for the work.
The cat didn't move a muscle.
Could you change my room to one with a view of the ocean?
We missed the deadline.
This is the last straw.
The kids weren't impressed.
I never said I didn't want you.
He told me to meet him at his apartment.
Don't ask.
Change is scary.
Do you plan to buy that car?
She betrayed you.
Your wife is going to ask you for a divorce.
What's your problem?
If I could stay longer, I would.
How about dining out tonight?
We know each other quite well.
They just want someone they can blame.
I thought you were smart.
What did you watch?
We're not entirely sure.
You don't need a lot.
She was lying.
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
I think that's enough for today.
I have to see it all.
He is just right for the job.
I care a good deal about what you think.
I'll be there tomorrow.
Everything was better in the past.
He's much younger than Tom.
I should've expected that to happen.
I never lied to you.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've got a small problem.
It stinks.
I just don't know how to do it.
All you have to do is sit down here and answer the doctor's questions.
I went on vacation, and my plants are still alive.
I am tired.
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
What're you doing here?
He unbuckled his belt.
I can only import GIF files.
I always have room for dessert.
He's likely to come.
Don't be upset.
A student wants to see you.
Everybody wants permanent peace.
All at once they began to laugh.
Let's do it again.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
I'm the one that pays all the bills.
What do you want for your birthday?
It is premature to discuss it now.
Please transfer 450 dollars to my account.
I won't hire anyone without your approval.
The actor died at the height of his popularity.
I think he's coming, but I'm not quite sure.
You look disappointed.
He was great.
I'm very fortunate.
Tom didn't complain about anything.
Tom's room was very clean.
How would you feel if your wife left you?
I was miserable without you.
They can't hear you.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
I love to watch baseball and football.
Is this my life?
It's the next logical step.
I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find out who hacked into our system.
It's like one of those.
He showed his photograph album to me.
I spent 100 dollars today.
Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
You don't have to worry about her anymore.
The leaves on the tree have turned red.
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
I don't deserve this.
The information you gave me is of little use.
I really couldn't have done this without you.
I have some time.
You have to ask me for it.
I promise I won't bite.
No sooner had she caught sight of me than she started running in my direction.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
Tom doesn't need to do that. Mary will do it.
It was a forced smile.
It doesn't matter to me whether she comes here or not.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Tom is an active person.
Whoever told you such a ridiculous story?
Nobody got up.
This made me sad.
Can we make one of those?
I had to give it a shot.
Ask around.
He went shopping.
They're hard to find.
Mother is making tea for us.
I just wanted to be popular.
Mass production reduced the price of many goods.
Something unexpected has happened.
People who don't want to go, don't have to.
I like to take things apart to see what makes them tick.
Aren't you embarrassed?
My mother has gone shopping.
Here is my bicycle.
Tom seems a little disoriented.
What do you have to add to 17 to get 60?
I'd have waited for you.
He scratched his head.
When I opened the curtains, it was snowing.
The old man served the king for many years.
I don't like feeling helpless.
My mom doesn't want me to play with you.
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?
Let's go now.
I know what you want to talk about.
Why didn't I think of that?
You're very timid.
You're conceited.
He came to my office yesterday.
I went into the town in search of a good restaurant.
He is going to the concert.
Her stern look got him to quit talking.
I don't think I can keep that promise.
The boys in the village laughed at me.
It's too cold.
You don't have to lie.
He has no house to live in.
I'm stunned.
I'm just an average guy.
What's your problem with Tom?
Tom thinks it's stupid.
He is drunk.
I can't remember his explanation.
I know what time you said to be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Are you all set to leave?
I'm greedy.
If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand.
You're too slow.
Somebody saw you.
When would it be convenient for you?
I'm not like that.
I want a box three times as large as this.
They elected her president.
The man looked at me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
He and I are in the same class.
Is he looking?
I hate the weather here.
You've made your point.
I was quite shocked by this.
They're not home yet.
Who's coming?
They're with me.
We're tired.
He had served as a congressman and senator.
I'll go meet her soon.
There's no right answer.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
Our house is yours.
John is two years older than I am.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep right away.
I did better than I expected.
I paid for them.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a race car driver.
I did it anyway.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
We will ship the product immediately after receiving your order.
"What are you trying to hide?" "Nothing."
I think there's a problem.
He's short and fat.
I persuaded him into accepting the offer.
This particular model has a really low battery life.
He was involved in a murder case.
We should've stayed with Tom.
What has he done to you?
I have not yet collected sufficient materials to write a book.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
I just got bitten by a mosquito.
Tom became a minister.
She will be back in less than ten minutes.
The main idea in his speech was unity.
If he donates a kidney, he can survive with the other one.
Turn on the TV.
All things considered, my father's life was a happy one.
Nothing ever happens in this old village.
You should not give your children everything they want.
It's suicide.
Stop shooting.
Be nicer to your brother.
Don't you want to see the world?
We need somebody.
You really shouldn't use pirated software.
She decided not to go.
I should do something.
I like hanging out with you.
Eventually the salesman persuaded me to buy the expensive machine.
I feel betrayed.
Let's travel together.
As far as I know, he isn't lazy.
Excuse me, but would you please tell me the way to the post office?
I almost forgot to tell Tom about the party.
Don't make me come after you.
He lives next door to us.
Well, aren't you glad to see me?
In 1994, there was a shortage of water and rice in Japan.
With a little more effort, he would have succeeded.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
I don't want to bother you guys while you're working.
She lives next door to him.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
His policies were too progressive.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Tom was well-known in the community.
We are sorry to say that we can not give you that information.
I thought this was mine.
That's my final offer.
You can go to the station by bus.
Handling dynamite can be dangerous.
He is not what he seems.
Let's go!
I can carry that for you if you'd like me to.
I've asked you repeatedly not to do that.
I'm ready to go now.
Father is still in bed.
He was in France.
There's no shortage of work.
You must obey the traffic rules.
Why do you laugh so hard at his jokes? They're not even funny.
I lived overseas for ten years.
Tom never seems to finish anything.
Is everybody all right?
Are you having any difficulty doing that?
I was sympathetic.
Nobody came to help me.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
We're sinking.
She spoke impolitely.
I need to warn my mom.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
She looks beautiful in that dress.
These shelves cannot support so many books.
Is that all you've got to say?
It's not my cup of tea.
Did somebody mention my name?
Somebody is eating.
Life is boring in a small village.
He is studying agriculture.
I bought a pen, but I lost it.
She forgot to feed the dog.
We'd better do something.
Your efforts came to nothing.
You've got the wrong person.
You have a pretty good memory.
I'm used to working all night.
What did I do to deserve this?
You'll never know whether you can do it or not if you don't try.
It's against my morals.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
He helps us.
You don't have a choice.
She hugged him.
Don't open the door till the train stops.
She invited me to the ballet.
I mean you no harm.
She isn't kind to him.
They know what's going on.
It's your money.
Where does he come from?
Have you seen Tom medical records?
Do you have anything further to say?
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
How about staying for dinner? I'm making a big pot of stew.
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
The plane was about to take off.
Can you loan me a pen?
How do you know what color it is?
Europe is not a country.
Let's eat lunch outside.
It snowed hard yesterday.
Things don't always turn out the way we plan.
You should do something with your hair.
I recovered.
The workers are against the new plan.
I highly doubt that.
I'll go get the pizza.
A doctor tried to remove the bullet from the president's head.
You're kind.
The press confirmed the rumors.
You can't hate the guy.
That's already been done.
I'm sad without you.
I knew who my enemies were.
Tom married a Canadian girl.
You're impatient.
Only time will tell you if you're right.
We need some help here.
That's impressive.
That's a question I've asked myself.
The students disobeyed their teacher.
My house is only five minutes' walk from the station.
I accept your terms.
I don't want to eat anything.
Follow me. I'll show you how to get out of here.
He was quickly recaptured.
Why have you been avoiding me?
I'll leave it up to you.
I only got your letter yesterday.
Tom despised Mary.
I had to park two blocks from here.
Did you go out?
You have only to push this button.
It is high time you spilled the beans.
I want to know if my baggage is going to arrive.
I go to Osaka by bus.
I disagree with you on this.
I hope you have insurance.
Let's take a walk for a change.
We have a party tomorrow evening.
He knows how to make good use of his time.
Tom was trying to be funny.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
I can't believe that actually happened.
Can I try on this pair of shoes?
We took turns cleaning the room.
Tom would never go there by himself.
Please say hello to your parents.
Don't you have classes today?
I'm not going to help you.
Tom tasted the wine.
I'm parked around the corner.
He looks very good.
Take whatever you want.
Go get some water.
He always keeps appointments.
What did you do exactly?
Your singing puts professional singers to shame.
We're all very good players.
I felt like such an idiot.
Tom is the best roommate I've ever had.
We had a very vigorous debate.
We were worried.
I was just looking around.
The game starts at two tomorrow afternoon.
How much is your hourly pay?
Tom unfolded his napkin.
In a way you are right, but I still have doubts.
Do you mind if I change the channel?
I'm at Tokyo Station now.
These all belong to me.
We can't put a young boy in prison.
Can I help you?
I can't reach things on the top shelf.
The outcome depends entirely on your own efforts.
My father often takes me to baseball games.
I knew I wasn't crazy.
He was imprisoned.
I didn't think we'd be able to get in.
I don't know what that is.
Make yourselves comfortable.
It's safe here.
I don't doubt that he will help me.
There's not enough light in this room for sewing.
They called for an end to the fighting.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I like instrumental music.
I just want you to come.
Look at all these boxes.
I'm going to Izu over the weekend.
She died from TB.
A few years ago, there was a huge scandal.
Tom will take care of this.
It's not just about the money.
I ate quickly.
Do I look fat?
She helped the old man across the street.
I spent my vacation at the beach.
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
Are you as tall as me?
I'm longing to see him.
I don't usually eat at places like this.
She doesn't need to go there herself.
It's illegal to park your car here.
When he got to the station, the train had already left.
Where are the other three?
Why don't you take a closer look?
I had a terrible stomachache.
I just haven't gotten to it yet.
Is this the bus to Oxford?
I may have seen that girl somewhere.
He came to Tokyo at the age of three.
Nothing is strange.
She had to take care of her sister.
They're all safe.
That worked.
The money is gone.
The girl was visibly shaken after the accident.
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.
Compare the two carefully, and you will see the difference.
Do you want to give it another try?
I'm at work now, so I'll call you later.
Man can't live without dreams.
Here's a basket full of fruit.
It's so simple that even a child can do it.
I was too stunned to talk.
I'm surprised they didn't have anything to do.
Are they all the same?
Search everyone who comes into this room.
I'm not supposed to drink.
She testified against him.
Please forgive me.
It didn't work out.
I'm not finished with you.
Where can the kids play?
We must choose the right moment carefully.
Her husband also wanted custody of the children.
I can't believe you bought this.
If you don't want to sing, you don't have to.
They are arguing.
The money has been put to good use.
He wrote a book on porcelain.
I beg your pardon. I didn't quite catch your name.
He did the work against his will.
I heard it thunder in the distance.
You probably already know about our company.
I suppose you want to use my office.
Tom has no intention of doing that.
I'll stand by you no matter what happens.
He turned the key.
You're the only Canadian I know.
Do you have your driver's license?
You didn't try hard enough.
He belongs to the brass band.
We are looking forward to seeing you again.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
They smiled.
She is dead.
We have a tight schedule.
I'd like to have dinner with you sometime.
We didn't actually see the accident.
You've been kissed, haven't you?
He has a book.
I really don't know.
They forgot to lock the door.
These windows aren't clean.
Tom isn't a bad guy.
It tastes like chicken.
She sat next to me.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
The investigation concluded that the police officer had done nothing wrong.
The back wheels on that tractor have ball bearings the size of my fist.
I dipped my finger into the honey.
I don't like your attitude.
The castle is now in ruins.
There are big differences in broadband speed and quality from country to country.
They sweated.
They found out.
It won't be long before we can start.
I don't know what the answer is.
I'm not saying this to hurt you, but it's the truth.
The President refused to answer the question.
She should be there now because she left an hour ago.
I thought you'd agree.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
How did you get so good at French?
Who did he see?
A light bulb gives light.
A child who is a native speaker usually knows many things about his or her language that a non-native speaker who has been studying for years still does not know and perhaps will never know.
Tom doesn't know how to swim.
My eyes feel itchy.
I refuse to answer the question.
I want to be with you more than anything.
Zoology deals with the study of animal life.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
How do you heat the house?
I'd like to be a teacher.
Beware of the dog!
I didn't expect you to get here so soon.
She advised him to take a long holiday.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Tom.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
I'm lucky.
I would rather feed my dog before we eat.
I can't stand that noise any longer.
Why do you want to learn French?
They all hugged.
I think I'll buy this tie.
I thought you'd want to meet my family.
Do you want a little cake?
Bears are quite dangerous.
I'd be delighted if you'd come with me.
Who told you all that?
Don't forget your stuff.
All the answers are correct.
I told Tom I wanted to go with him.
Whose side are you on?
Show me everything.
I want to be left alone.
I will buy a watch at the store.
I love being around him.
All his friends backed his plan.
There is nothing new under the sun.
What should we do if it rains?
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
Let me pay for the dinner.
Are you still jealous?
I'm impulsive.
I'm not going to see you again.
I have already changed my clothes.
I waited for him all day long.
I'm looking for a sweater.
This is pretty tense, isn't it?
He has a foreign car.
I wasn't cooking anything.
That's not going to change.
According to the contract you may take three days of bereavement leave for your uncle's funeral, but only one for your nephew's.
A prolonged silence followed.
I presented my ticket at the door.
We're going inside.
May I borrow this book?
Give him a hug.
You're surrounded.
I wonder if you understand.
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
Some people think eating at home is better for you than eating out.
She gave us a present.
I never drink tea with milk.
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
I am about as big as my father now.
We've made good progress.
I'm very happy you'll be visiting Tokyo next month.
It only takes about fifteen minutes to walk to the station from here.
You should have introduced yourself to the girl.
I think there is no point in trying to persuade him.
I was very worried about her.
I think it's time for me to say what I really think.
Are you angry?
As a result, prices rose.
I really did learn a lot.
Do you want to go to the aquarium?
She committed suicide yesterday.
That was exactly what she intended.
She doesn't have a babysitter, so she can't go to the party.
You're lazy.
Do you want some hot chocolate?
My homeroom teacher is Mrs. Jackson.
It's too small.
I don't think we need to do it.
Tom didn't give me any alternative.
Who told you Tom was sick?
Is there something that you want to tell me?
Were you even tempted?
I'm by your side.
She hit him.
This one's on me.
It was the perfect moment for a kiss.
He had no difficulty in finding the place.
Tom put on his backpack.
You're confused.
Two cars were in an accident.
I am yours and you are mine.
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early.
You've been cleared of all charges.
This dog is mine.
I wish there were more people like you.
How did you come to know one another?
Please follow the nurse's directions.
The museum is worth a visit.
Are we sinking?
Tom told us about what he did in Boston.
Everyone looked puzzled.
She closely resembles her mother.
What were the meetings like?
How do you remember that?
No one knew who did it.
I felt very uneasy.
Newspapers printed the proclamation.
I felt scared.
What else can you do?
I'd like a word with Tom.
Tom is in a lot of trouble.
My daughter's getting all gussied up for her first date.
Where did the money go?
It looks like snow.
The weather is nice tonight.
She has a very beautiful laugh.
There's not enough time.
I believe congratulations are in order.
Whose paper is this?
It is forbidden for you to touch that switch.
I hear Tom was the one who taught you how to play the cello.
I don't feel sick.
It'll be hard to persuade Tom.
I kept him company while his wife was in surgery.
Tom struggles with this concept.
I got what I needed.
I've advertised my house in the newspaper.
I hope you're well.
The children went out to play.
We're both right.
Was anybody hurt?
He wouldn't even look at me.
I think you need this.
I think you know what I think.
Would you mind rubbing my feet?
What have you heard?
There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night.
I suddenly feel sick.
Where on earth did you get it?
She loves her children.
What is my room number?
He zipped open his bag.
I'll do anything I can for Tom.
Everyone knows what happened next.
Tom died at 65.
I'm a long way from home.
Don't move, or I'll shoot you.

Clear off the table.
Tom has joined the army.
Many runners passed out in the heat.
Where did you go for spring break?
I unlocked the door.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
Do you speak Bulgarian?
The painting is not worth the price you are asking.
The house by the lake is mine.
I think you must be getting tired.
Let me write down the address.
Parents can pass many diseases on to their offspring.
The man you see over there is my uncle.
I'm confused now.
I haven't had dinner.
What do you think now?
I wasn't feeling very well.
I have no experience.
I just wanted to say thank you.
It seems that he is rich.
I lost no time in doing it.
We don't care what he does.
They got it.
Keep driving.
It appears that he is honest.
A committee is a group of people who individually can do nothing, but who, as a group, can meet and decide that nothing can be done.
His behavior puzzled me.
I'll give you a lift home.
I want you to give me a job.
I ordered a book from London.
We already know each other.
I've never met a musician that I didn't like.
They never returned to their country.
There's no cure.
I've learned to live with the pain in my back.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Why didn't you do anything?
I had things to take care of.
It's in times like these that the character of a person becomes apparent.
You ought to have seen it.
This bread smells really good.
She kept quiet.
What does he expect?
Tom vanished without a trace.
It might prove useful.
She is two years older than you.
I wouldn't care.
I'll take two or three days off.
I didn't know you were from Boston.
I looked at my watch and noted that it was past five.
What are you grinning about?
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
I will go with you if necessary.
I thought that I told you to stay behind.
I will do it right now.
The more time I spend doing this, the less time I have to do things I enjoy doing.
I don't want to get involved.
I can't think of anything to write about.
I am very sensitive to the cold.
Why do you dislike his way of speaking?
All you have to do is push this button.
Go upstairs and bring down my trunk.
I don't like coffee.
Tom and Mary are still young.
He is in the bathroom.
The world is dangerous.
Will you take a personal check?
I want more detailed information.
Don't give up hope.
Telephone him if the message is important.
Don't let me down.
What is the language spoken in Brazil?
She lost her way.
They were not listening to music.
Tom is making tea.
What makes you think I'm not happy?
He is worthy of our praise.
There are times when I'd like to be more like you.
Look up there.
I want you to be by my side.
I could hear everything.
The man was ashamed of being born poor.
Tom set the bird free.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
I hope Tom remembered to shave.
I'm not afraid of snakes.
He didn't run fast enough to catch the train.
We had to alter our plans because we didn't have enough money.
I just had to check on something.
He's a bigot.
Do you want the long version or the short version?
Do you mind if I turn off the AC?
You're big.
I don't trust anybody.
How's your old lady doing?
Are they all nuts?
Did I hurt your feelings?
I thought it would be fun.
She is singing the latest popular songs.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
He is a gentleman.
You can't see me, can you?
We have to be willing to take the first step.
Suddenly, the light went out.
Can't you help us?
I've only seen him once.
Should we wait?
My hobby is collecting insects.
Do you mind turning on the TV?
There is no necessity for you to do that.
I'm very proud of our students.
We are going to have a storm.
We've accomplished a lot of things.
I really don't get you.
This message doesn't make sense.
You won't stand a chance.
I don't think anybody's going to help you.
I've already told Tom what to do.
It looks as if it is going to rain.
My father quit drinking.
This is an opera in five acts.
Come on, guys. This is not funny anymore.
It's just blood.
He sold all that he owned.
Can you identify the man using this picture?
She gave him money as well as food.
What did I do that for?
We know you're interested.
Get on with it.
I had no clue.
Faith can move mountains.
This file is encrypted.
I will play tennis this afternoon.
Tom certainly had a point when he said we should allow more time to complete the project.
We went swimming at the beach.
He shook his head.
Tom was given a warm reception.

We hurried in the direction of the fire.

How much did you pay the electrician?
Those who want to remain may do so.

She's busy now and can't speak to you.
Choose a password that is easy to remember but difficult to guess.
The children watched TV as Tom was cooking dinner.
Prices went to amazingly low levels.
There is a man waiting for you at the door.
Have you ever been to Africa?
I know you have a girlfriend.
I am a student of this school.
Tell me why you didn't do what I asked.
You're double-parked.
Has he lived here for two years?
I figured it out by myself.
He hurried past me without stopping to speak.
No one understands you.
It seems interesting.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
She was promoted.
I love your dress.
Tom talks quickly.
I can't bear this any longer.
What language do they speak in the United States?
I wish Tom would help me weed the garden.
This doesn't serve any purpose.
Don't open it, please.
She looked him straight in the eyes.
I laughed in spite of myself.
Your problem is you're not patient enough.
It's better to err on the side of caution.
He enjoys his sleep and doesn't like to have it interfered with.
I was expecting you last night.
Tom and I'll come together.
The men are eating lunch.
The tree bent in the wind.
Tom stared blankly at the wall.
What's your full name?
What are your duties?
It's a sunflower.
All of the children had gone to bed before it got dark.
You should make sure that you have enough money in your pocket to pay for the ticket.
I think you need a lawyer.
I think the number of common-law marriages is on the rise.
Please come again.
I want it to be different this time.
She came to see me.
How foolish of you!
Do you have your plane ticket?
I took two aspirins for my headache.
I went to school.
Can you hear me?
I'd love to know that.
I want to be in a rock band.
His youngest son is five years old.
May I eat a little of it?
I accused him of cheating.
Are you going to come back?
This chair is broken.
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
He requested that I come here again this afternoon.
I suggest we swim across the river.
He bought a hat.
Are you sure this is the right train?
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
It's a piece of cake.
Is there anything we need to discuss?
I think it's very romantic.
Why did you ditch me?
That's icky.
I ate breakfast at eight.
I never asked for it.
The bomb will explode in 10 seconds.
I had to give it a shot.
What's he talking about?
Have you ever had lunch at this restaurant?
What time do you leave home in the morning?
That's exactly what I want to hear.
You don't look very strong.
Have they spotted you?
You're amusing.
You'll never get ahead in this place unless you go through the proper channels.
I have to change the batteries in the radio.
I'll give it to you.
I'm glad that Tom is here.
They trusted you.
Just think what it could do for you.
I didn't think I needed any help.
I'll gladly pay you anytime.
I think you've been very immature.
Do you want to know where you made your mistake?
The explorers ventured inside the caverns.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
I'm open to suggestions.
Do you love your mother?
We don't have enough time.
All his friends backed his plan.
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
I hope you like what I've just given you.
The settlers accepted the Indians' help.

I knew this was a mistake.
They left it to me to decide on a gift.
I knew it was a joke.
I haven't gotten any letters from Tom yet.
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
Tom wants an answer.
The public at large are dissatisfied with the present government.
You're not that interesting.
I know I probably won't win.
She spent a lot of time writing her essay.
Is it something important?
He is beyond help.
They relaxed.

I have a part-time job working as a Santa at the mall.
Who would like to go first?
I want you to leave my family alone.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
We feel frustrated.
Their contract is to run out at the end of this month.
I will go out after I finish my homework.
I'd rather work than go out.
Food really does taste better when eaten with close friends.
I did OK.
I have just a few bullets left.

Stop arguing.
An old man was resting in the shade of the tree.
It wasn't easy.
Tom lost his only son in a car accident.
It's time you stopped watching television.
I was younger then.
The weather's bad, isn't it?
You must pay attention to him.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
Guns don't kill people. People kill people.
I see they've put you to work.
That's not very elegant.

I'm sure everything will work out just fine.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
He takes a walk every morning.
They admitted her to the hospital.
He arrived after I had left.

Have you read the leading article in today's paper?
The story was very interesting.
They don't take care of that dog.
I bet you're right.
He will make a good doctor.
What do you do on Sunday?
None of them wanted to talk.
It's a pity that you can't come.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
We all want you back.
It'll take some time, but I think I'll be able to learn how to play the guitar.
His house is surrounded by trees.
What're you all dressed up for?
It's not a joke.
I love seeing you so happy.

Tom lit the candles.
He painted a dog.
How many have you had?
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy.
I need to talk to you now.

How many have you killed?
She may be our teacher.
You should conform to the rules.

I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
This shoe fits me well.
She celebrated her fifteenth birthday yesterday.
I don't know where to go or what to do.
The teacher treated all the students fairly.
Thanks in advance.
I cut myself with a hacksaw.
How many times have I told you?
What's the fun in that?
Do you have plans for dinner?
We promised.
I didn't go to the market.
You are very attractive in blue.
What do you want to do about it?
I would prefer to only hire people to translate into their native language.
I fixed the car yesterday.
We have to keep working on that.
I knew it was a lie.

Keep a low profile.
That was wrong, of course.
How do you even know that?

I need to put the children to bed.
How about going to see a movie with me?
This made me very sad.
I won't obey those orders.
He's your son.
What do you do?
It's booby-trapped.
Are you hiding something?
Don't dwell on your past mistakes!
I'll just have to improvise.
We had lived there for ten years when the war broke out.
That's certainly one possibility.
I'm not asleep.
Don't let them see you're afraid.

You won't even remember me a few years from now.
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen.
Let's ask the teacher.
I regret kissing you.
You disappoint me.
Can you forgive me?
Paper burns easily.
I thought they wouldn't come.
Do you love my brother more than me?
That boy is very clever.

I was the only one not invited to the party.
Painting is another thing I can do fairly well.
I can carry those suitcases for you.
French is Tom's native language.

Are you afraid of dogs?
I wonder if he is married.
I have errands to run.
I have never tried Chinese food.
It happened early this morning.
He must be a good boy.
I have a big dog.

How many English words do you know?
You're lucky that you have a job.

I studied before supper.
Tom said you were good at chess.
My father will not be busy tomorrow.
There's a lot of furniture in the room.

They'll think of something.
She was hungry enough to eat anything.
How big you are!
She has no brothers.
Your cat will survive.
That child wants a friend to play with.
He found the box under the table.
Read it once more, please.
It may be that he is not a bad man.
When I was a child, I used to go to the seashore every summer.
It's not fair.
They want to tell you their story.
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
Excuse me for a moment.
Tom heard some shots.
That requires careful consideration.
I'd like us to be friends again.
He looks tired this evening.
He thinks that his success is due to luck.

It is wrong to cheat at cards.
Do you have a daughter?
We are measuring the depth of the river.
I know you see it, but are you really looking at it?

Do you speak French?
Tom said that it was just a coincidence.
I have some errands to run.
No one got hurt.
If I've misjudged you, I'm terribly sorry.
Use this.
We just arrived at the station.
That gives me a headache!
I think it's time for me to contact her.
Give me a hug.
No one cares about that anymore.
Who's coming for dinner?
He asked me out on a date.
They hoped to sell the stocks at even higher prices.
I was expecting a tougher game.
You don't fall in love with somebody because he's perfect.
He couldn't come because he was sick.
What's your real purpose?
I don't regret what happened last night.
What does any of that have to do with me?
You should not have gone to such a dangerous place.
We were both afraid to talk.
I want somebody to talk to.

I have to take the entrance examination today.
You don't know the truth.
There's more to this than meets the eye.
I thought you wouldn't give up.
Have you ever been in a traffic accident?
I don't have a lot of money, but I get along somehow.
My car is out of gas.
I did so for the sake of my health.
Just promise me that you won't do anything silly.
He rolled over in his sleep.
You're totally ignorant.
He doesn't know where he should be.
I was the first to begin speaking.
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
Tom is one of my oldest friends.
I wish you had done what I asked you to do.
Try not to be late.

I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
No one was there.
Don't leave them alone.
She went inside.
I don't need to be lectured by you.
I want to help you figure this out.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
I think Tom did something he shouldn't have.

I can't drink alcohol.
Can't we have a snack or something?

I think they're using you.
Unfortunately, it's raining today.
He thought that I was very tired.
I must go out.
I was kidding.
He was jogging down the beach.
I'm looking forward to seeing him.
My sister is constantly reading comic books.
I'm coming over to your place.
Could you please tell me again where you put the key?
You'll feel better if you take this medicine.
We're home.
I thought you should see this contract.
He's open-minded.
Tom told Mary what had happened.
That's a lot of cash.
Tom doesn't own a credit card.
Tom couldn't stop laughing.
You shouldn't go to school.
We missed the exit.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
I think I don't understand you.
Maybe he's not young.
I've got to make lunch.
We never voted.
I trust we're all alone.
I still need to talk to you.
I'd do it again.
I thought you might be upset.
Tom couldn't afford to buy the bicycle he wanted.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
He has been dead for five years.
Please show me your stamp album.
I was just wondering if you have been able to find a place to live.
Tom lost his balance.
You don't look your age.
We all want to be desired.
I don't suppose anything will happen.
He is younger than me by three years.
No one noticed.
Don't worry about your family.
I can't do two things at once.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
This organization cannot exist without you.
Can I get a connecting flight to Atlanta?
I have a friend at City Hall.
You can count on me any time.
Where exactly did you go?
You should be more careful the next time.
I'm not good enough for you.
I know what they'll want me to do.
I thought that you were able to speak French.
Why don't you start?
I have many talents.
How did you get so good at French?
I am not a teacher.
I have no will power when it comes to dieting.
Correct me if I am wrong.
You're nuts!
His attempt to escape was successful.
He can't swim at all, but when it comes to skiing, he is the best.
I met her by chance.
Are you still working for Tom?
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
Mary loves shoes with high heels.
It's close to my house.
He is capable of doing it.
I have a guilty conscience.
I feel safer here.
How long do we have?
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Stop what you're doing.
I won't say it again.
You'll be late for work.
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I figured you would understand.
It's rather cold for April.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I must go alone.
You probably don't want to talk to me.
We're hiding.
Do you trust anyone?
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
Do you like it when I do this?
I've got to do something first.
I have a little money now.
She's as busy as Tom.
People were evacuated because of the flood.
It is probable that she will come.
You're very busy.
You must be in love.
I'd like some time alone, please.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
How about dining out tonight?
Don't touch the button.
I think he's attracted to you.
He lied about his age.
Tom opened the window a crack.
He is about my age.
Tom says he has nothing to hide.
Who is that woman?
See things as they are.
I'm starved.
What sort of information do you get on the Internet?
Tom buttoned his coat.
They were not amused.
The world is full of idiots.
He is a good singer.
What is he doing?
I was so happy.
What more do you want?
I am baking bread.
I like your outfit.
We're being watched.
You like him, don't you?
Is it love?
I think it won't rain this afternoon.
Tom hates raw onions.
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
How do you plan to make amends?
Sometimes trying your best just isn't good enough.
I have rights.
That is so embarrassing.
She always gets up at six.
The number of people suffering from heart disease is on the rise.
Can you say that again?
She surprised me.
I'm good at playing the piano.
Are you lonely?
It's a lot of fun skiing in fresh snow.
Is it possible to get on the next flight?
His way of speaking offended me.
You have many books.
I have a problem dealing with authority.
He was born rich.
I don't know when he'll come back.
"What will you have to do?" asked her friend.
You should be more careful the next time.
You're courageous.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
I can't let that happen again.
I know Tom likes to travel.
I have an appointment with my lawyer today.
That's all I needed to hear.
He easily gets angry.
We will play a tennis match.
They were all friends.
What were you two doing?
I can't do it in this heat.
You should have been more careful.
Pass me the salt, please.
I'll handle it.
I really am glad you're here.
I have a bone to pick with you.
There are holes in the roof.
The food is on the table.
Just look at him.
I figured you'd enjoy this movie.
I think we should wait a little longer.
How could anyone be so stupid?
Do you want to stop?
Tom used to eat a lot of meat.
I want to talk about it now.
I'll teach you how to write.
I hate beans.
You have many friends.
I'll take the yellow one.
I don't know what's happened.
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
Without your help, I would have drowned.
Tom decided to risk it all.
Are you over your cold yet?
You need to have breakfast.
Draw a circle.
Tom doesn't like us.
I was careful to not leave any evidence.
How much money does he make a month?
I have bad news for you.
All you have to do is push this button.
Why do you need a doctor?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I often do my homework before dinner.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I don't need it anymore.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
They accused him of telling a lie.
Did you find your purse?
Please write to me from time to time.
I can't wait to go on a vacation.
His proposals were adopted at the meeting.
It really doesn't affect you, does it?
I find this difficult to believe.
That's beside the point.
If it gets boring, I will go home.
I'm ashamed to say that it's true.
I was tired today.
America likes to claim that it is a "classless" society.
I'd like to know what it is.
I had to work.
I know what they're going to do.
He's a cardiologist.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
Who would you like to speak to?
I have to explain this to Tom.
His ideas are based on his experience.
Tom got a job at a local pizzeria.
He dropped in on me.
Since you're tired, you should rest.
Drastic measures must be taken to prevent the further spread of the virus.
I met an American girl.
We need to make sacrifices.
I had never seen so much money.
A recent survey shows that the number of smokers is decreasing.
I'll send you home in my car.
Do you want something?
An animal can be much more dangerous when wounded.
She is beautiful like her mother.
Did you just hear what you said?
Here he comes.
Show him how to do this.
We were disappointed with the results of the experiment.
Does it matter to you?
I didn't hear you come in.
Do you have a ticket?
Stop dating losers!
Why are girls so complicated?
Do you know how they knew?
Tom is getting on your nerves, isn't he?
He always wears blue shirts.
What did you make?
This makes no sense to me.
He wanted it to be a surprise.
Do you realize how late it's gotten?
I inquired about the book in many stores.
The lady that is speaking to that boy is his teacher.
These trees were planted by them.
You are to come with me.
How do you intend to do it?
I am tired of eating at the school cafeteria.
How big you are!
Is there an information counter?
Bring me a cup of coffee, will you?
He repaired his watch by himself.
I can teach you how to fight.
Walking down the street, I ran into an old friend.
This CD belongs to my son.
Do you consider them dangerous?
I must say I'm flattered.
Death is an integral part of life.
What he said embarrassed me.
They must have had an accident.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
I've learned to expect the unexpected.
My sister is afraid of all doctors.
Stop the car now.
I'm only three years older than he is.
I thought this present might be from you.
How would you define normal?
Get out of my kitchen.
I'm the one who built this.
I like rice.
Let's try to have a nice day.
I hate that you have to leave.
How much did all this cost?
I'm glad I invited you.
Why are you alone?
I have the ace of clubs.
I want her to do the difficult work.
They made fun of my accent.
I am lazy.
We're better off without you.
What else?
Reading books is very interesting.
Tom died before his son was born.
Be a good boy.
Do you live alone?
Who is the gentleman he is speaking to?
How long do I have to wait?
Don't worry. I am not mad at you.
He can't be trusted.
Tom gave me a vague answer.
Would you open the window, please?
Dry your face with a towel.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
Do you have any idea what they're talking about?
We think the world of you.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
This is my first day.
She still loves him.
I'll be absent tomorrow.
He had no objection.
Are you ready to go?
Do you want to know why I lied to Tom?
I miss my mom.
We've all got ears.
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
I've never flown in an airplane.
What's going to happen?
I really don't think that'll be necessary.
Keep quiet.
I'm giving my old books away.
How are you going to solve this problem?
He didn't want to leave.
I want to be an astronaut.
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
He's a bit jealous.
I hate what I've become.
I like listening to classical music a lot.
Could you please explain what's going on here?
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
I only hope I'm not too late.
The situation seems hopeless.
How can you not know?
What's this street called?
This is unexpected.
I left the keys in the ignition.
We are playing tennis this weekend.
Who's going to pay the bill?
Cuban soldiers were guarding the streets.
I don't know what this is about.
It's high time the children went to bed.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
His unique perspective helped shed light on the situation.
English is hard, isn't it?
I guess we're not invited.
You're right, I think.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I think you know that's not a good idea.
I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
He is sure to pass the exam.
She was advised by him on that matter.
Come back home.
I know how busy you've been.
What time is it?
She always expects me to help her.
I wonder why.
When did you meet her?
I asked Tom for his keys.
I just want to get it over with.
Don't you see what that means?
Father has lost his job, and what's worse, Mother has fallen ill.
The computer is in the library.
Get rid of the gun.
The students demonstrated against the new government.
I know the drill.
Let me go.
Are you waiting for Tom?
You were scared, weren't you?
Many people think that children don't spend enough time playing outside.
I have tried everything.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
You are new students.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I don't have a car, but my sister does.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Tom was late for dinner.
You would look stupid wearing your mother's dress.
The policeman was confronted by the angry mob.
Do you want to play with me?
I wish I were as smart as you are.
I have to paint it.
Coming here was a mistake.
I shouldn't have stayed up all night.
Eventually, Tom found out what had happened.
Will you go?
Do you know how many people in the world starve to death every year?
I don't know what you really want.
She couldn't attend the morning church service.
My uncle gave him a present.
I'm really proud of you.
I think I've figured out why Tom has never learned to speak French so well.
I'll do the dishes.
The cat is on the table.
Are you sure they can do this?
You aren't invited.
Tom has allergies.
The athletic meet was put off until next week.
I want to keep working here.
Air the futon.
I had almost finished my work when she came.
I had to do it by myself.
This box contains assorted chocolates.
My father's car is very nice.
I don't drink that much beer.
You're disobeying orders.
He was lying on his back.
I'll drive Tom home.
Despite his riches, he's not contented.
No one showed up.
They can't all be bad.
I never thought you'd become a doctor.
That's it.
Tom understood exactly what Mary meant.
You don't want to point that gun at me.
What're your plans for the weekend?
I'm good at singing.
Do you study every day?
Dinner will be ready soon.
You need to sober up.
Do you have a fishing license?
Tom wanted to ask Mary how old she was, but he thought that maybe he shouldn't.
It won't be easy.
I plan to write Tom a letter.
Let's go by car.
That house is built of bricks.
I don't believe in banks.
If you don't hurry, you won't get there before dark.
In my opinion, this is quite unsuitable.
Tom amazes me at times.
Tom told Mary that he had a new girlfriend.
He didn't reply to my letter.
You're not allowed to park here.
I'm sure she'll leave early.
Let's continue where we left off yesterday.
It's not a disease.
Do you like caramel-flavored ice cream?
You're very forward.
Don't be so silly.
I don't need an excuse.
I want to warn you.
He likes to dress up as a police officer.
I love the way you walk.
She is exceedingly sensitive to the cold.
You look upset.
How are you feeling today?
He used to read at night.
There's a lot of furniture in this room.
How interesting!
Do you have medical insurance?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I got confused.
Your father won't buy it.
Have you finished your work?
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation?
You don't have to do what Tom says.
I know how old you are.
The bottle smashed to pieces.
He is not what he was ten years ago.
I've been here for a while.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
I studied French for three hours last night.
Let's dance, shall we?
Would you like to play tennis every Sunday?
I'm fat.
They have no natural predators.
I had a really great time last night.
Time cures all things.
That's all I can ask.
Say which one you would like.
I advised Tom not to do that.
He had already gone.
Don't eat the fruit in the bowl on the table. It's plastic.
I would like to see you before I leave for Europe.
That's odd.
Can I call you again?
I had no idea this bracelet was stolen.
She gave him the car.
Don't let go of my hand, or you'll get lost.
The water is warm.
I think you should choose Tom.
My shift's almost over.
She taught the child never to play with matches.
I have to talk to somebody.
Someday you'll regret this.
You people are amazing.
There is a knock at the door.
I think this is important.
Tom wanted to spend some time in the country.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
I don't need a nap.
You would look stupid wearing your mother's dress.
You're very forward.
I've never seen Tom do what you say he always does.
Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
Aren't you glad you're rich?
You talk too much.
Are you with the FBI?
I like working with you.
Don't worry about me so much.
You're almost as tall as Tom.
What was it that you gave him?
She doesn't admit that she is wrong.
You had better start at once.
You don't have to come.
The audience clapped loudly after his speech.
Who would care?
This building is about to collapse.
A drunk driver was responsible for the car accident.
I really like seafood.
You are naughty.
What do you think the audience wants?
I'll do everything within my power to make sure your children are safe.
He urged his government not to sign it.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
Why haven't we begun?
Lightning can be dangerous.
Why don't we all run?
She stared at him with hatred.
I know what they're doing.
Are you mentally ill?
We stayed at a nice hotel.
I live in this house by myself.
The accident occurred on Friday.
No one agreed with me.
What is its purpose?
My father brags about never having had a traffic accident.
Will you watch the superbowl?
Tom doesn't put sugar in his coffee.
I never feed my dog raw meat.
Can you meet me in the auditorium?
How did you get here?
They were afraid of being overheard.
You're probably too young to understand this.
What you're doing makes me nervous.
That toy is made of wood.
You don't know how much I love you.
We ate at the food court.
What do we call you?
The prime minister appoints the members of his cabinet.
You're very brave.
Go get some water.
It's Tom on the phone.
I don't know what to think.
How are you going to do that?
We're in the same boat.
Keep the meter running.
I didn't pretend to be your friend.
We need to get it done before tomorrow.
I'm not surprised you don't know the answer.
I couldn't find it.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I'm perfectly all right.
I'm not a scientist.
How do you think you're doing?
You should not go there.
The thieves divvied up the stolen loot among themselves.
I'll bring lunch.
I didn't go to the funeral.
You should take advantage of this chance.
This town is increasing in population.
I have a great deal to do today.
The students must not enter the teachers' room this week.
I'm not mean.
I just want to have a good time.
Tom wants to buy some books.
I heard a young girl call for help.
My family are all very well.
We have a half-dozen eggs.
It is impossible for him to finish it in an hour.
May I use your phone?
He became financially independent.
Is this absolutely necessary?
Why are they here?
They are both good teachers.
I hope you will be completely cured.
He never saw his father again.
He is much older than he looks.
I made friends with a student from abroad.
I'm leaving tonight for Australia.
No one doubts her fitness for the post.
The bacteria that are transferred during a kiss help improve your immune system.
I'll have to explain that to my father.
I need a map.
You're not a doctor.
Everybody knew Tom could speak French well.
We've got to fight fire with fire!
I can't believe you would do that to me.
Please don't get up.
You have to pay 10,000 yen extra on holidays.
Do you know any of the boys in this room?
We're students.
You'll have to take his place in case he can't come.
I had never seen a windmill until I visited the Netherlands.
I don't see what you two are so happy about.
I can't eat.
She showed me her new car.
It's all over for us.
Do you have plans for dinner?
I had no idea you could dance.
You bought the food, so if I buy the wine that will even things up.
I appreciate what you are trying to do.
Can you keep it a secret?
I never touch beer.
Adjust the brakes.
How did we not see it?
Something is wrong.
At the start, I was really still a bit scared.
I'm too old for this.
I want you to run to the store for me.
I'd like to hear you sing your new song.
Grab the bottom.
Are there any questions?
He fashioned a walking stick from a fallen branch.
Fasten the gate.
Why didn't you come to the party?
You are tired, aren't you?
He made many excuses for being late.
Can you account for all the money you spent?
Don't fall into her trap.
I'm suddenly tired.
Let me die.
You shouldn't let children play with the kitchen knife.
She and I usually agree.
There is no reason for you to feel inferior to anyone.
I spent a week in Berlin living with a German family.
Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news.
Christmas is a special holiday.
I talk to Tom on the phone every day.
We shared the cost of the meal.
I don't have a family.
Do any of you have anything to say in connection with this?
I made a list of things I needed to bring with me.
Where do you have pain?
I love to swim.
You look perfect.
I don't think I can eat this.
I really hurried.
Where are you bound?
You're acting like a small child.
You're scaring the kids.
I'd like to have breakfast with you.
He made a speedy recovery.
I thought it'd be fun to sing a few songs together.
Don't you think that's a bit weird?
I never lied to you.
Will that make any difference?
He cannot be trusted.
I was aware of being watched.
Here's some deodorant.
I started that.
They live in the same state.
Tom held Mary in his arms.
Can't you do something to help me?
Ring the bell when you want me.
Trust me.
I've heard rumors about you and Tom.
I feel cold. Would you shut the window, please?
Don't worry. I've got you covered.
It's worse than you think.
Do you look up to your parents?
I'm sorry, I don't really remember.
Are you falling for me?
A wonderful idea occurred to me.
I escaped death.
I'm very proud of my son.
We're not so sure.
All my friends are getting married.
He works like a maniac.
I feel awful about what I said.
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones.
Only you can answer the question.
No one I know wears a tie anymore.
I'm not insane.
If he comes, give him this paper.
Traffic is a major urban problem.
Do you accept the explanation?
I can't remember the combination.
He will be a good teacher.
I have no more than one hundred yen with me.
I broke it.
That sounds very tempting.
My mother is preparing dinner.
Everyone is free to contribute.
I ought to wear this tie more often. I've gotten a lot of compliments today.
I sleep on my side.
The more I think about it, the less I understand it.
I need it immediately.
I'll have dinner.
Are you seriously ill?
The new tunnel will link Great Britain and France.
When it was time to vote, he abstained.
This is twice as large as that.
Our school library has many books.
I swim here every morning.
The ball bounced up high.
He wants to reach a wider audience.
I was nearly ten when my parents gave me a chemistry set for Christmas.
He looked at me out of the corner of his eye.
Get them out of my sight.
How does your opinion differ from his?
If you want to talk, let's talk.
I want to do something useful.
You were just doing your duty.
She said something to him.
There is a rapid increase in world population.
Is everything okay?
Tom put the first aid kit back where he found it.
Let's not forget that.
Long time, no see.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've got a small problem.
They're doing it right.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
That's why I'm here.
My cat likes to look through the window.
Could you leave us alone?
You can't help yourself.
This is very true.
What's wrong with running around your house naked?
I always feel blue on Mondays.
Will that be for here or to go?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I'm glad you're still here.
He got the ball.
That dog is big.
I'm ready to make amends.
Did you know that?
He reminded his wife to wake him up at 7:00 a.m.
They were attacked.
It seems my dreams never come true.
No one was hurt.
This doesn't change anything.
Please send an ambulance.
Maybe we should just give up.
Are you still jealous?
Is any of this true?
I had little choice.
How was your meeting?
It was personal.
I was just in time for the last train.
Do you want to know why I lied to Tom?
One must observe the rules.
We could crash.
Come on! Give me a chance.
I think that's for Tom to decide.
Tom will know what we should do.
What kind of car are you driving?
Tom asked Mary many questions that she couldn't answer.
I'd like to take this with me.
As soon as I can get a decent video camera, I'll start making videos to put online.
Whatever he says goes.
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
On a first date, it's best to steer clear of touchy subjects.
She went on working.
Don't tell me you can't swim.
My uncle calls on me every three days.
I explained it to him.
Lunch is ready.
The president appeared powerless.
Have you ever scolded your daughter?
Go on without me.
That's what you always do.
Is there a letter for me?
Do we need to bring our dictionaries to class tomorrow?
Give me some water, please.
Tom doesn't believe it.
You're ambitious.
All roads lead to Rome.
She is as thin as a broom stick.
We stayed at home because it was raining.
Tom isn't going to wait.
I perspire a lot at night.
I'm at a loss about what to do with the mess.
Tell me what really happened.
You will soon get used to the change of climate.
Where's my driver?
It is strange that you should know that.
I really do appreciate all your hard work.
He believes in the supernatural.
Will you go there?
I tried to write with my left hand.
She is very much like her mother.
She may have said so.
Tom didn't even know I was here.
I just needed some water.
We met before.
It's been a while, hasn't it?
I wasn't the one who wrote this.
Do you think I'm joking?
I want to find out who broke the window.
I can't wait to leave.
If you're happy, I'm glad.
She took a deep breath.
Another man has died.
Speak into the microphone.
Let me bring you up to speed.
The food is cold.
It's not quite ready yet.
Friendship is a matter of trust.
He's married.
I can hardly believe this.
We're friends now.
I need to go milk the cows.
Is there anyone living in that house?
If I screw up, what's the worst that can happen?
We're jealous.
They regarded the man as a danger to society.
You can't count on their help.
When does that start?
A cookie is under the table.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
The house is haunted.
I just want answers.
One of my friends bought a red car.
I hope that I can do it.
He is always forgetting things.
Did the trip live up to your expectations?
You'd be the one to know.
Maybe he likes you.
We lost a lot on that job.
For dinner, we went back to my place.
I saw that.
He talked to the chairman.
You should quit smoking.
I'll do the best I can.
No one can go in there.
I'll be around all day.
I'm through with my work. Let's go out.
Mary took her necklace off.
He did not understand her joke.
The pleasure is mine.
Discretion is the better part of valor.
Hokkaido is in the northern part of Japan.
Give me five tokens, please.
He's in danger of being evicted.
I will always be there for you.
I'm not sure I want to do anything.
What a beautiful woman she is!
I was a little surprised.
She followed him home; then killed him.
Can you recommend a good dictionary to me?
I can't carry on like this.
Youth is wasted on the young.
That company hires people without regard to race, religion, or nationality.
Here he comes.
We heard the door shut.
You're such a tattletale.
What are you doing?
I may not have enough time.
Is there something you want to tell me?
Hummers are big gas guzzlers.
I really appreciate your coming.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
I know you're smarter than me.
You may stay here with me.
How did you get into my house?
She needs you.
The explorers cut their way through the forest.
Thanks very much.
What a beautiful baby!
Windows 95 crashed on me AGAIN!
I told you I have a girlfriend.
Why did you turn away when you met him?
Nobody knew what to say.
I don't have to study tonight. I think I'll watch television for a while.
How long has it been since you've seen your boyfriend?
I think she made up that story.
He said two or three words and left.
You're getting closer.
They say that he is very rich.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
Is there anyone else around?
Tom doesn't understand you.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
I can't remember my password.
We were all devastated.
Tom has decided to have the surgery that his doctor recommended.
Those are the leftovers from lunch.
He is a professor of English at Leeds.
I insist on being paid in advance.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
She told him that he was right.
We're conservative.
Can I talk to you alone for a second?
You can't know that for sure.
I thought you were a decent young woman.
Tell me where you went.
She looks very young.
Don't make any loud noises.
Consider it an emergency.
She told him that it would rain all day.
You should apologize to her for having been rude to her.
My mother looks young for her age.
You don't know where it is, do you?
I think you know that's inappropriate.
I have no will power when it comes to dieting.
Don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
I got up early the next morning to catch the first train.
Is this legal?
Don't say another word.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
I don't have any brothers.
I love the way you think.
What station is it?
I'm indebted to you.
The years pass by quickly.
His behavior is worthy of respect.
Buy the full version.
We have something else in common.
I agree with you absolutely.
I was young and stupid.
I went not once, but twice.
I realize that.
This is my father's.
Do you remember what you did last Friday?
The rabbit stood in the middle of the road, mesmerized by the lights of the oncoming truck.
He missed the train by one minute.
Just say yes.
Why didn't you call somebody?
I took an arrow in the knee.
She told him where to put the suitcase.
The black cat purred, as if he was being petted.
They read newspapers and books.
Our mother bought us a puppy.
This smells like cheese.
I was in London last month.
This is no joke.
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?
There is another way.
She is no match for me.
You're through.
Are you telling me how to do my job?
The talks continued for two days.
I am going to watch TV this evening.
Never ask a question if you aren't prepared to hear the answer.
Which is your book, this one or that one?
Are these the glasses you are looking for?
Three crew members were rescued.
You should have seen it.
He made up an excuse.
I can't do without your advice.
How much should they get?
I really miss you.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
Tom joined the army.
The old man was accompanied by his grandchild.
I'll need to run some more tests.
There's someone here to see you.
How do they expect us to survive?
I just don't want to have people thinking I'm weak.
It wasn't much of a bridge.
That still leaves us with the question of why.
The outcome depends entirely on your own efforts.
When will you leave?
I figured it out by myself.
She hates him.
Silence is golden.
I hope you're not offended.
I shouldn't have to go to the dentist again for a while.
How about going for a walk after lunch?
I had no idea who she was.
What are you up to?
I wish I had a million dollars.
I don't like people looking at me.
How long ago was that?
I wanna quit my job.
She is always neatly dressed.
Give it to me.
He picked up the phone.
I got rid of it.
I figured you would understand.
I need it immediately.
The weather is bad.
Are you trying to grow a beard?
Who was it that bought those pictures yesterday?
You're not bleeding.
Once more, please.
That comes to the same thing.
This hall holds two thousand people.
Last night an explosion took place at a fireworks factory.
A trip to the Riviera should do you good.
It's essential that we find them.
Money cannot buy happiness.
The idea of surprising her suddenly crossed my mind.
I can't blame you.
Do it again!
Have you ever been married?
You should apologize to him for coming late.
It's all downhill from here.
It is a book.
This bike belongs to my little brother.
She trusted you.
There's no such thing as luck.
The sky has become clear.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I wanted something to eat.
We are not here for fun and games.
A plane is flying above the city.
She turned down my offer.
It's dark in here. Do you have a flashlight?
What year were you born?
He seldom reads an editorial and is not a book worm.
I wanted to watch that movie with you.
That's not our job.
Most of my friends are guys.
You should write it down before you forget it.
You have to go.
Where would you like to go?
I want to see your mother.
He banged his head.
The customers were made to wait outside in the rain for several hours.
Don't let anything else distract us.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
Tom's bored.
He looks good for his age.
Tom began to feel a little guilty.
"Where was he headed?" "He was headed north."
I've seen one many times.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
My aim is to be a doctor.
It's just an idea.
My hands are cold.
I was one of the last to leave.
Can he see us?
You said you were going to handle it.
Some animals are active at night.
What I need worst is a haircut.
Tom didn't call.
He mentioned it.
I don't know how to do that.
She has about 2,000 books.
Here's a yellow rose.
I don't care what happened.
Did you understand me?
Tom can't even read.
Be prepared.
We won't be able to arrive home in time.
I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
I love seeing you so happy.
My car won't start.
Why do we have dreams?
How long have you waited?
What are you wearing?
How come you didn't call me last night?
You're mistaken.
Give him a break!
You have a great imagination.
I need help now.
The old couple sat side by side.
He can speak both English and French very well.
How did you manage to escape?
This stain won't come out.
He speaks as if he were an expert.
People love freedom.
How are you?
She puts aside a lot of money.
The snow melted away in a day.
We could have our tea in the garden, were it a little warmer.
It's going to be tricky.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
I must be going deaf.
"Do you know when they will arrive?" "At eleven-thirty this evening."
I'm really surprised Tom's not here.
She reminds me of someone.
Here is a letter for you.
Nothing has been decided.
I like coffee better.
Would you like to go with me?
Tom didn't do what he was asked.
The girl doesn't like to play soccer.
I am interested in Asian history.
The telephone rang a few minutes later.
I have to go on a diet to lose weight.
The view is amazing.
How far is it from New York to London?
They arrived at the foot of the mountain.
Tom didn't understand a word Mary said.
I must speak with you alone.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
I need to finish my homework.
He came back two days later.
How am I supposed to eat?
That sounds interesting.
She returned to Japan.
You should think of their religions.
I don't feel like taking a walk this morning.
I wore a hat yesterday because it was very cold.
Have a nice time.
I want to be left alone.
They go shopping.
French has many more vowels than Japanese.
Tom didn't like the concert very much.
Everything seems normal enough.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
I must go.
We don't want to pressure you.
How did you get into Harvard?
That's what I'd try to do.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
I have thirteen names on my list.
You should not talk back like that.
I am not kidding.
If you could do it, would you?
He's cleaning his rifle.
I was thinking about going to that new place on Park Street.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Why don't you listen?
Her remark got on my nerves.
Tests start next week.
You'll change your mind.
Please handle it with the utmost care.
We talked about time zones.
You're very generous.
Drive on.
Just a minute.
Can anything ever be the same again?
I have a tourist visa.
Just tell me what to do.
Yes. That's right.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
At night, parents tuck their children into bed.
Don't forget.
He slipped while crossing the street.
Do you like tea or coffee?
His secretary seems to know the truth.
Be prepared.
I'm not sure why Tom asked me that.
That feels amazing.
What did she do to you?
Summer is coming to an end.
I'm not making that up.
I'm here to save you.
Just ignore him.
The church bells are ringing.
I feel like I know you already.
I haven't heard from him for ages.
Everyone knows everyone.
I don't know the exact place I was born.
They are five in all.
I refuse to discuss the question.
They say love is blind.
I don't know anything about cricket.
I assure you this isn't just about money.
I don't even understand that.
I should get back to writing my report.
I thought about what you said yesterday.
Your pen is better than mine.
I want to see you in your office in half an hour.
I can't tell you what Tom told me.
Now I'm in trouble.
Divide this among yourselves.
They moved here three years ago.
I have a solution in mind.
You don't have to come see me.
Get on the bus.
Tom ordered Mary to do it.
He abused my confidence.
There's no wind here.
Take your time. There's no rush.
It shouldn't be like that.
Get off at the next stop and take a bus headed to the airport.
The ring was not to be found anywhere.
This dog is white.
I arranged for a car to meet you at the airport.
I really don't care.
I thought we talked about this already.
Tom's funny.
You're not fit.
Are you sure about this?
We can't be sure, can we?
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
I made some mistakes on the test.
Who can tell what will happen in the future?
Far from being pleased, my father is very angry.
I love you just the way you are.
May I sit next to you?
She let the secret out.
Do you want some help?
He suggested that the meeting be put off till Monday.
Remain seated, please.
What are these people doing?
She spoke to me with a smile.
I didn't understand any of that.
He went to the library.
How many books do you think you have read so far?
Do you like to sing?
You won't be fired.
Not everyone noticed.
You may get it free of charge.
The speed of the spread of AIDS is horrifyingly fast.
She's too loud.
They met for the first time in London.
I left my guitar in your office.
The fuse has blown.
There is no milk left.
The medicine worked marvels.
The dog is as good as dead.
No one can escape growing old.
He drew a straight line on the wall.
I'm awake.
Do you know how far it is from the station to city hall?
I saw what you did.
A new museum is being built in the center of the city.
Don't be lulled into a false sense of security.
She hit him with a hammer.
They were caught in a blizzard.
Find the cat.
She is guilty of stealing.
The girl let the bird go.
Since it was so hot, we went swimming.
Tom is starved.
I'm about the same age as you.
I appreciate what you did earlier.
I can't believe you're here.
I'm not home right now.
You aren't like the others.
What were you thinking about?
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
He lived alone in the forest.
I just wanted to let you know.
He wants to spend time with his son.
These articles cannot be exchanged.
Those children are cheerful.
Farmers sow seeds in the spring.
Why is Tom so dressed up today?
People are more educated now than they used to be.
You needn't have taken a taxi.
I'll never forget you.
He is used to such situations.
I don't think I've ever eaten anything that you would consider disgusting.
To make a long story short, everything went fine.
Tom and Mary are looking for you.
Tom doesn't look troubled at all.
Yesterday I played tennis for the first time.
I didn't know you then.
It was extremely hot, so I took my coat off.
We talked about it just yesterday.
I was feeling nostalgic.
You can't do both at the same time.
He's not in yet.
Tom is getting some coffee.
We're out of luck again.
Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
When was this university founded?
She avoided answering my questions.
Even though I looked for it, I did not find it.
My investments earn about 10 percent a year.
I heard from him last month.
The air is damp.
I know what Tom and Mary are going through.
December has thirty-one days.
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
Didn't anyone question you?
Take whichever you want.
An athlete must keep in good condition.
The women are working.
He only speaks one language.
How thoughtful of you to have chilled some wine for us.
She grabbed him by the hand.
I'm not as intelligent as he is.
They are reading her book.
I'll be careful.
He is such a lazy fellow.
I talked to her for an hour.
The law has been changed.
They lost again.
She came out on top.
I know everybody here.
Tom is about as tall as Mary.
Thank you.
I'd rather be at home.
The noise will wake the baby up.
I got it for nothing.
Tom pressed the intercom button.
It's necessary for you to go.
Do you live here?
This dress is a good bargain.
It's really not that expensive.
I can't see the movie.
You will be all right again in a couple of days.
Will you give any discount if I pay in cash?
She can't find her hat.
If you have something to say, say it to my face.
I want to know what to expect.
I never said this job would be easy.
I love your jacket.
Women age faster than men.
You're conceited.
I need proof.
Have you seen him before?
It being Sunday, the shop was closed.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
Slow down.
Are you available?
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
Why not apply for that job?
I met your friend.
There's a yellow rose there.
You get out only what you put in.
Who takes care of you?
No one can do that.
I still think it's unlikely that he'll come today.
I wish you could have come with me.
She advised him not to drive too fast.
Can I use your pencil?
What is on Channel 10?
He gave me a cold.
It looks like we're almost out of the woods.
This bicycle is mine.
They answered my questions with difficulty.
Tom must've been home at that time.
You're wonderful.
He objected to my going out yesterday.
Have you ever tasted such a good soup?
I don't want to discuss it anymore.
She has been looking after her sick sister for ten years.
Tom told me he was working.
There's no need to be rude.
It's not my birthday.
How much did you get out of the deal?
The roads are slippery, so please be careful.
The old man tends to exaggerate.
I'm fussy.
We nearly starved.
Close the door, please.
That was a funny joke.
He could not speak French well.
Everyone has their own strong and weak points.
What would you do if you saw a man from another planet?
I want a pool.
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
I don't know what's real.
She is two years younger than me.
I think Tom will be well prepared.
She attacked him with a pair of scissors.
I've been waiting for her for an hour.
You are cleared for takeoff.
When will you arrive?
When will you start?
I'm sick and tired of hamburgers.
Let's go to the beach.
We can get a beautiful view of the sea from the hill.
I will go on foot.
It's nothing to be alarmed about.
Who are you trying to convince?
Did you accept his invitation?
It's always been that way.
Tom can barely speak French.
You have to come.
It's nearly impossible.
You enjoy that, don't you?
You're very resourceful.
I saw what you did.
Isn't it a lovely morning?
Actually, you're right.
Do you have enough blankets?
He is expected to come home soon.
I'll be glad to.
Do you know where your children are?
He shook hands with the mayor.
Do you use aftershave?
I've heard that some people sleep in bathtubs.
You can do it, too.
Tom did a good job.
She suggested that I take him to the zoo.
She's a tough woman.
She was reading a gardening manual.
It was so cold that we made a fire.
Are you pointing at me?
I had my shoes shined.
I found the building.
They are approaching.
Is it true that you gamble?
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
After they had finished their work, they went out.
Have they arrived yet?
That's perfect.
We'll win.
I was very reluctant.
He submitted his resignation in protest of the company's policy.
She took up his offer.
I need more time.
No one seems to smile anymore.
I gathered together my things and put them in my suitcase.
Tom was startled by a knock on the door.
They're coming for us.
I think we can trust Tom.
I would like a cup of tea.
I was watching TV when the telephone rang.
I should've listened to Tom more closely.
I'm not a saint.
Can you translate English into Japanese?
I figured it out by myself.
Why don't you come in?
Did you see anybody?
I'm sorry.
I don't buy that.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
She stopped picking daisies.
It turned out to be true.
How many people did you kill?
You're first.
The soldier groaned with pain.
Winter is my favorite season.
That's not nice.
She loves cats.
He took over the business from his father.
I was going to write to you, but I started doing other things and forgot.
He has seen better days.
I don't expect help.
Are we disturbing you?
I don't suppose there's much chance of that happening.
Do you offer any day trips?
I have to go.
The thieves made off with the jewels.
Please don't call the cops.
He's a very fine musician.
The driver was charged with speeding.
I did it a few times.
He wasn't there last week.
In two years, the company has more than doubled in size.
You didn't miss the meeting.
Well, are you coming?
We really do need Tom's help.
Whose paintings are these?
I don't even know where to start looking.
I'll give you a book.
Any further discussion is pointless.
She married him last year.
I like being with you.
Get out of the truck.
I wish you'd never been born.
Let him go!
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
Her hair was so long that it reached the floor.
You deserve so much more than this.
At last, we reached California.
Someone tried to kill me.
Do you still have feelings for her?
He helped me do my homework.
To drive a car, you need a license.
Do you have Saturday off?
You better hurry.
I have been wanting to ask you a question.
I'm wealthy.
I don't think they believe us.
I thought Tom was bluffing.
She is happiest when she is at home.
At last, we got to the lake.
I need to search for my pen.
Don't even think of asking me what I think about you right now.
Do you really not know?
We need to get you to a hospital.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
Tom loves to sing.
I want to be your boyfriend.
We went up the mountain by cable car.
I was moved to tears by the story.
The old woman is a doctor.
Tom said he regretted not following Mary's advice.
We made friends with them.
Tom skipped dinner saying he was too tired to eat.
I'm your brother.
It's already out of fashion.
Without you, I am nothing.
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
I put it here somewhere.
I got a useful piece of information out of him.
I tried to call you last night, but you didn't answer.
Be nicer to your brother.
Tom isn't very good at French.
It was too muggy for me to get to sleep last night.
What a cute girl!
I like this custom.
He could do it.
I need you in my life.
I knew I could do it.
May I have a receipt?
You need to be more patient.
Why is autumn called "fall" in America?
It took me more than a month to get over my cold.
Tom and Mary don't seem to really talk to each other all that much.
Take a break.
Stay out of my room.
I just can't get it right.
Hold the line, please.
What she said made him angry.
There's no way I’m taking the rap for his mistakes.
I'm glad you're coming.
Guess what I did last night.
I remember locking the door.
You should exercise more.
It doesn't matter anymore.
When you leave, I'll miss you.
She put on her hat to go out.
Supplies of oil are not infinite.
Are you angry with Tom?
I had things I had to deal with.
What did you find out?
Several houses were washed away by the flood.
No one escaped.
How do you pronounce your last name?
Don't you see what's happened?
They look sad.
I suppose I could do that.
I was able to answer the question.
I never said that it wasn't a good idea.
Everybody's in position.
I'm very serious.
It wasn't much of an earthquake.
I can't think of everything.
I'll pack.
He has a dark secret.
He attributes his success to good luck.
Just use mine for now.
I know what it's like to be different.
Tom wants to be your friend.
I set myself realistic goals.
She slapped him.
What happened exactly?
How soon can you get to my house?
This bracelet is very inexpensive.
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me.
The city wants to extend the road.
I do believe you.
His life is in my hands.
The company went public and became listed on the stock exchange in 1990.
That should be kept between us.
I can't believe it's really you.
I don't think you understand.
He makes good use of his talents.
You're shy, aren't you?
Hey, how's it going down there?
Sooner or later, I'll probably get tired of doing this.
It's great to meet you.
Call me if anything happens.
This doesn't prove anything.
You don't have to apologize.
All at once the lights went out.
You can sleep here for a while if you want to.
It's completely irrational.
These books belong to me.
He cleaned it up.
I will be expecting a letter from her.
The streets are lined with old shops.
You want me to do your dirty work for you, don't you?
She advised him on that matter.
We've known each other for a long time.
We're all very worried about you.
Just get back to work.
She seems to have been happy.
A party will be held next Saturday, that is to say, on August 25th.
He was discharged from the army.
Tom advised us not to do that.
I thought perhaps you'd give up.
She is fond of singing old songs.
Would you like to come to my party?
It's been weeks since she's written.
Whether rains or not, the game is going to be held.
I don't want your apologies.
Tom hardly ever speaks French to his mother.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
You're not going to believe this.
I want you to sing.
Refugees poured in from all over the country.
Why don't you remember?
Darkness is the absence of light.
Don't they drive you mad?
I haven't seen her for ages.
You need to lose weight.
I know you're not like that.
The boy carved his name into the tree.
Are you content with your present salary?
Tom is in better shape than me.
Do you want to go?
The party ended at nine.
It's important that I hear this.
The rain shows no sign of stopping.
You must think I'm really strange.
Are you awake?
Toss your gun on the ground.
You've got a lot of nerve bringing me here under false pretenses.
I helped him yesterday.
Your mother has made you what you are.
They all envied my new car.
I think I lost my keys.
I tested everything.
She hates him.
Tom doesn't like the rainy season.
I do have one request.
Tom has already finished the book he started reading last night.
Is there the subtitled version?
I know what you want to do.
I was aware of that.
You've got to be bold!
I'm methodical.
I want to go to Seattle.
We'd better hurry. I don't want to be late for the concert.
Who did you vote for?
Take whichever of these you want.
I think Tom wants to see you.
Do you miss it?
How well can you dance?
I went there to meet him.
It is kind of you to say so.
I'm no friend of yours.
Must this letter be written in English?
Is someone meeting us?
He is an authority on China.
I don't yet know what we're supposed to do.
How did your test go?
I'd prefer to not take that risk.
You're fashionable.
It's not good enough.
It may be impossible to get a completely error-free corpus due to the nature of this kind of collaborative effort. However, if we encourage members to contribute sentences in their own languages rather than experiment in languages they are learning, we might be able to minimize errors.
I thought you'd be alone.
Do you have any food allergies?
The players scrambled for the ball.
Please be careful.
The boxer was pressured to throw the fight.
I got a famous singer's autograph.
It hurts here.
When did I give you that?
History is repeating itself again.
A father provides for his family.
I miss you badly.
It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict.
I usually do the dishes.
I won't be quiet.
Have you put on weight?
Life is sweet.
What did you decide?
I don't see how that would help.
I didn't expect to find you here.
Tom, it's not your fault.
We want out of here.
I walked along the river.
That ended better than I expected.
I need to change my tires.
Only one person survived the accident.
He had a bitter experience.
I know you love Tom.
What a phony!
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I would like to order a sandwich.
She put it in the box.
Boys can be trained to behave.
You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?
Bread is made from wheat.
You don't look that good.
Have a beer with me.
I waved him back.
A passing car splashed water on us.

Don't write in red ink.
He's my best friend.
Can you make it on time?
She demanded to see the manager.

You can't be sure of that.
They had a heated argument.
Pay attention to what you're doing.
I'm too tired to think.
The Greens are against everything.
He says his son can count up to 100 now.
I didn't steal it. You can check my pockets.
They didn't see it.
I don't like looking foolish.
The last time I saw Tom he was walking on crutches.
Can anyone believe you?
You'll soon get used to eating Japanese food.
Do you really want to help?
I could've gone last week.
How fast can you do it?
I want to go abroad.
How is this possible?

You'd be the one to know.
Don't worry. I'm good at this.
You're fussy.
The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.

It's not as easy as people think.
My friends call me Tom.
I prefer reading books to watching television.
Tom always makes it a rule never to ask a woman her age.
Will you join us?
Tom scratched his name off the list.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
Why would anyone do that on purpose?
I think they saw me.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.

The concert was a success.
I'd like to think about it a little longer before I make a decision.
She ordered him to do it.
Do you like the corsage?

This is something new.

I needed help.
How many years did Tom spend in Boston?
Are they in love?
When was the last time you saw the cat?
She's wearing a nice hat.
Tom doesn't know which color to choose.
Please help yourself to some fruit.

I am dying for a cold drink.
You should go now.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Everybody seems to be having a good time.
They arrived there before dawn.
The bookstore is open.
No one I know goes there anymore.
We're back together.

You can't kill us both.
She handles a saw very well.
I loved reading when I was a child.
They'll have a blast.
I only went inside once.
He told her that she was right.
An elephant isn't as big as a whale.

That's just what you needed.
Where did you get on this bus?
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
He went shopping.
I don't belong.
The crowd got out of control and broke through the fence.
He is watching my every move.
You have been warned.
I owe you something.
Spit it out, Tom.
Don't let him do it by himself.
You need a drink.
It was pitch-black.

We'll try to be more careful the next time.
This is not my specialty.
You're doing it wrong!
The boys worked hard.
It's convenient living so close to the station.
It's too good to be true.
Someday I'll run like the wind.
We haven't come to a decision yet.
We might find something.
I just need a little more time.
You don't seem too sure.
Can you help look after the kids?
Is there something wrong?
You've been selected.
It works fine.
Tom said that he was thirsty.
He is unfit to be a teacher.
I'm not going.
I run this place.

Don't say a word to anyone.
Take his car keys.
Won't you have some fruit?

He has no hat on.
What a strange story!
Those children are waiting for their mother.
Let me congratulate you on your success.
I'm really unhappy about this.
He did both at the same time.
What are you up to?
How much did you bring?
Normally, I stay at home on Sundays.
You should call the police.
What time do you want me to be here?
I'll put some coffee on.
I don't think I could forgive myself if I did that.
Do you think I should go by myself?
You can't keep something that big a secret.
I have a question to ask you.
That was very frustrating.
I guess both of us were lying.
It's on me.
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is hurt you.
The answer's yes.
You owe me one.
I don't know where my keys are.
Give the devil his due.

That's what I expected it to be like.
It was such a cold day that we decided not to go out.
Let's escape together.

She is familiar with Japanese history.
Are you thinking about getting a job?
I'm from Bulgaria.

I'm not normal.
People can easily tell the difference between them.
Do you know that guy?
That's incredibly boring.

This is an exception to the rule.
That's enough.
It's not subjective.
I need to learn Japanese.
I don't know if Tom still lives in Boston.
I have evidence.

Don't forget to turn the light off.
He succeeded in solving the problem.
We study English every day at school.
You've been warned.

Could you explain how the dishwasher works?
You've got the wrong person.
I am calm.
You've made your point.
Do you have a crush on my brother?
You're greedy.
We don't have all afternoon.
Aren't you sick of eating here?
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
I misunderstood.
Could you please have a look at this?
Take care of yourself. Don't get sick.
Did you take a shower today?

I'm getting used to eating alone.
I write every chance I get.
I kept an eye on her suitcase.
You know me well.
Will you show me your album?
Please don't be late.
The consequence was that she lost her job.
Tom thinks Mary is lying.
Tom won't be going camping with us this weekend.
Why did you ditch me?
You seem happy.
Hey, guys. What's up?
You'd better not do it.
I can't read French, nor can I speak it.
Are you bringing anyone?

What fun!
How does it help us?
He was assigned a task.
Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.
You've done a superb job.
If you allow me to speak, I'll be able to explain everything.
What are you talking about?
I'd like to ask you one question.
I am not accustomed to walking long distances.
Didn't you read the manual?
I didn't sign up for this.
The danger is over.
So what happened to you anyway?
I belong to the swimming club.
I really should be getting to bed.
I didn't know what to say.

Do you want me to be happy?

I have never seen anything like it.
This is the perfect place.
That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?
Don't believe everything you hear.
I was deeply impressed by his speech.
I think it's safe to assume Tom won't be here tomorrow.
I'm a bit nervous right now.
How long are you going to stay?
You really don't get it, do you?
I understand how you felt.
We enjoyed watching TV.
They say she's sick.
You need to be careful.
The boats collided head on.
We should try to understand one another.
Go ahead and take one.
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
You're very open.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I doubt that's what really happened.
We're going to eat right now.

I got up earlier than usual in order to catch the first train.
He is still on his back.
Did I miss the turn?
Don't be crazy.
He feels hurt.
I've been asking myself that same question.
Draw a picture of yourself.

This looks longer than that, but it is an optical illusion.
I'll wait.

I think we should all go together.
I have a lot to do today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to have this discussion at another time.

They're jittery.
I wonder what happened.
They may leave tomorrow.

I went through a lot of trouble.
Why don't we settle the matter once and for all?
I didn't think anyone was home.
If I had not overslept, I would have been in time for school.
Tom said he was starving.
I came upon a rare stamp at that store.
You're worried, aren't you?
It sounds like a dream.
She put on socks.
Tom wants desperately to believe that what Mary said is true.
Do you use all this stuff?
Someone stole Tom's money.
Try not to be so tense.
Please throw the ball.
I can't say I'm shocked.
Your guess is wrong.
In English the verb precedes the object.
Please give me a piece of bread.
I never thought I would have to support such a large family.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
They found out.
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.

I need to go.
I want to hear you play the piano.
Are you tired of living?
Tom was third.
Have you sold it yet?
I think I've forgotten something.
He denied the accusation.
He had a traffic accident.
It's very good.
I didn't think you were needed.
I had such high hopes for you.
The older he grew, the more modest he became.
My career is on the line.
Are you ready to begin?
Do the police have any suspects?
I didn't want you to read that.
He will be missed.
He is wearing a hat.
Are you all ready?
I'm not a morning person.
They are well looked after.

You do want that, don't you?
What is wrong with her?
What payment options are available?
I'd prefer to talk later.

They absolutely detest each other.
My house has a small yard.
It's time you got married.

He is very brave.
Don't you care what happens?
I really love you.

What do we do now?
Do it this way.

I'm not hungry yet.
You must do it quickly.
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
I was moved to tears by her speech.
How many proverbs have we learned so far?
She is wrong.
I'm not exactly surprised.
Answer my question carefully.
I'm all yours.
It is too late for me.
I can't bear to work with him.
I thought you might want a drink.
They'll be here at three.
When should I return the car?
Is your mother at home?
She told me that her mother had bought it for her.
Do you know when they will arrive?
He made a gesture of impatience.
Get on with it.
I had to do it.
Don't change your mind.
He says that he has no memory of the evening.

The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
She was late for the bus.
Do you mean you're giving up?
I'm also thinking of going to Korea.

Describe that accident in detail.
It blew my mind.
You're so sweet.
I was caught in a shower.
I made a deposit in the bank yesterday.
I hope you will soon get well.
Pretty flowers do not necessarily smell sweet.
She was envious of her cousin's success.
He isn't here, is he?
Do you believe in UFOs?
Everybody's still there.
Tom has a big nose.
What color is this?
We must find something to plug up this hole.
I can't believe you're going to give away all your money.
I have nothing to fall back on.
He nodded encouragingly.
She has a very good voice.
Tom enjoys watching sports on TV.
You can have this watch for nothing.
I was sick.
Don't look for us.
I don't like waiting.
There's no one sitting here.
I've got plenty more where that came from.

What've you got?
He's not sure he's ready.

Can you make it safe?

You look terrific.
I won't let you boss me around anymore.
We must do it quickly.
Don't ask questions that you don't want to know the answer to.
I worry about your health.
I'll never work for you.
I was really worried about you.
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
It's not going to take long.
I apologize for what I said.
I can't go with you tonight.
What shall we buy him for his birthday?
I'm prejudiced.
Why don't you give tennis a try?
Did I give you that impression?
Nice of you to drop by.
How long did you stay at the party?
He will be really pleased.
It makes me nervous.
What is the difference between this and that?
This does not apply to students.
Can you give me your phone number?
Are you sure this is the right address?
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
He banged his knee.
Is it poisonous?
That story is too incredible to be true.
He always studies hard.
Can you take on the job?
That university was my first choice.
Spanish is his mother tongue.
He didn't know that.
I'm being promoted.
They treat their employees well.
Should I wait for her to come back?
Nuts are nutritious.

Just out of curiosity, what do you expect to happen?
You are so cute.

Where am I?
We work from dawn until dusk.
I need all the luck I can get.

You must be more careful from now on.
Where can I find a hospital?
I feel like such an idiot.
I'm buying a puppy.
I am expecting a letter from her.
Please do not try this at home.
I wonder what ear lobes are for.
You don't have to tell me this.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
You know what might happen, don't you?
We can't attend.
Tom couldn't finish his dinner.
You know I have to go.
He cleared the path of snow.
It's as good as finished.
The wind blew the umbrella out of her hand.
Would you move your car, please?
To determine its origin, we must go back to the middle ages.
I thought about it a lot.
I'd like the bill, please.
This party is awesome.
He is well acquainted with French literature.
I'd like you to do your best.
I will finish my homework by nine.
Tom took a couple of steps back.
I always root for the underdog.
Did you do all this?
If that happened, what would you do?
Our negotiations broke off.
His sisters as well as he are now living in Kyoto.
I'm not surprised you don't remember.
We knew enough.

Maybe Tom didn't do what everyone says he did.
It's normal for you to feel a bit woozy.

Why are we helping Tom?
I hope so.
Try this.

They said that contact with the plane had been lost.
I'd like to buy half a cake.

I felt a light touch on my shoulder.
You're very nice.
I want this fixed as soon as possible.
She bowed in thanks.
It's unbearably hot.
It's awfully cold today.
Tom was popular.
I met him in the crowd.
Is that better?
Bad weather kept us from going out.
It is not easy to get rid of a bad habit.
He lives in a posh apartment near Central Park.
I'll go tell the others what we need to do.
I hope your wishes will come true.
I hired someone today.
It's cheap.
We almost got them where we want them.
He left the book on the table.
I'm not your friend.
Does she know your telephone number?
I'd like you to meet him.
You get out only what you put in.
They knew how much danger they were in.
I've got nothing to report.
Are you still playing golf?
We didn't want to go, but we had to.
We were actually pretty lucky.
You're not upset, are you?
Somebody has stolen my suitcase.
The shrine was built two hundred years ago.
No doubt she will come soon.

I'd rather live in peaceful poverty than in wealth and fear.
You're nothing but a coward.
I would like to thank you for your collaboration.
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
I think that's where Tom works.
What does the future hold?
Is there anywhere you want to go?
For your own safety, never ride in a car with a drunk driver.
What do you have to lose?
A good sweat will cure a cold.
Where's your school?
What season do you like the best?
He has just left home.
I am out of work.
Tom ate my lunch.
I felt strong.
I don't know how to deal with this.
Is it dangerous?
School is boring.
Someday, we'll know.
Who do you think would do such a thing?
I was thinking about you.
Aren't you pushing it too far?
I just got a call from your school.
I feel empowered.
I thought we'd be safe here.
I don't like spring.
Don't be so impatient.

Do you understand that?
I think everything is ready.

How about your father?
Tom won't go to prison.

It only works on Windows.
I asked for my father's help.
What do you grow on your farm?
Let's take a rest for a while.

I'm on my way to visit a friend who's in the hospital.
My nose is itchy.
Do you mind if I smoke?
I told you not to come here.
Please wash my back.
I'm fine.

They are all alike to me.
Are you sure everything's OK?
I want you to wash the car.
This book has a lot of pictures.
Don't you think it's time you left?
I have Tom's keys.
I beg you to help us.
You are hearing things.
I advised him to come back at once.
I'll show you that I am right.
Where did you go for spring break?

He has nobody to consult.
He wanted to go to sea.
I'm thirty.
He's a professional photographer.

I think there has been some misunderstanding here.
I can't explain it either.
I'm disgusted.
Her daughter is very pretty.
Tom spilled some wine on his shirt.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
It's made of brass.
Keep your nose clean.
Love will prevail.
Do come if you can!
This stove is easy to use.
I didn't even notice you.
He gave me what I needed.
She advised him about what to do.
Scientists are fighting to stem the spread of the AIDS virus.
If he comes, tell him to wait for me.

Is that for me?
Would it help me?
Do you need a lift?
I don't know what you're interested in.
Is there a garden in front of the house?
Can you direct me to the post office?
I helped him carry his desk.
You had better read your teacher's comments on your compositions one more time.
We admired the beauty of the scenery.
He's about the same age as you are.
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
I must finish this work first.

Can you pay me in advance?
I didn't feel bad.
What's your speciality?
Don't be alarmed.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
We are sorry we are unable to accept your request.
I figured I had enough money.
We want our money.
They made sure nobody could see them.
Once she arrives, we can start.
How old are your kids?
Sure, it might be traumatic, but so what?
I think it's time for me to split.
You're not easy to find.
I've got to head back to work.
I hope that I'll see her.
What happened to all that money?
He fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident.
I'm here to help you.
Don't confuse Austria with Australia.
We have a similar predicament.
They told me I had to help you.
I want you to know what really happened.
Maybe it's not as hard as it looks.
These oil fields have only begun to be tapped.
I am hers and she is mine.
He is very eager to go there.
I couldn't get it.
We went due north.

I'd be grateful.
I'm meeting Tom for lunch at a restaurant on Park Street.
Did you enjoy the show?
If you want, you can phone me.
Well, that could be helpful.
The senator has a very demanding schedule this week.
You're not interrupting anything.
Put on your pajamas.

You should do something you enjoy doing.
I had things to do, so I couldn't leave right away.

I'm not ready to fight.
You know this isn't the way we should be doing this.
I wish I could figure out how to embed a YouTube video.
How do you always do it?

We'll decide later.
You'll break it if you're not careful.
Is anyone else home?
He arrived here ten minutes early.
Like I said, I was busy.
I have to apologize.
He did nothing but cry.
I just don't know what to do anymore.
Tennis is my preferred sport.
He has curly hair.
Don't worry about it.
I never knew his first name.
Would you like to hear more?
What a fool I've been!
Let's dance.
I thought I'd never hear that.
You don't know that.

Where's your dog?
Call me if anything changes.
Why did you want to come back here?
The situation is hopeless.

What year were you born?
The prisoners were set free.
The apples are red.
Excuse me for being late.
Who will provide capital for the venture?
I can't believe this.

Didn't you get my message?
The river flows between the two countries.
No one could solve the puzzle.
The president takes office tomorrow.
I'm not in favor of this plan.

His poems are difficult to understand.
I'm desperate.
Sapporo is the fifth largest city in Japan.
I can't pinpoint the problem.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
Hey, I got you a beer.
Let's go outside and eat.
Why don't you go talk to him?
Should I be jealous?
Is there a problem?
Tom is boring.
Step away from the car and put your hands on your head.
It is difficult to prove that ghosts exist.
I once worked in a restaurant.
Would you like some coffee?
There is a fence around the house.
I'm glad I invited you.
I know you're richer than me.
We can't tell anybody.
My mother is active.
You should carry out your promises.
He will be here all evening.
He's a very talented man.
Stay in bed.
You're not good at this.
I know what you were doing.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
I have diabetes.
I'm about to tell you something important.
I know who didn't do what they were supposed to do.
We're proud of that.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
Tom is your uncle.
My teacher told me that I should have spent more time preparing my speech.
Do you have a pet?
I haven't swum since last summer.
I'm not good at pretending.
Nobody knows his name.
You still haven't told me who he is.
I can't help feeling sorry for the girl.
Read the bottom of the page.
Tom rolled down the window.
I'll leave it up to you.
How do I get to the airport?
Do you like this color?
She has known him for a long time.
I'm halfway through this crime novel.
She watched him continue to fight as hard as he could.
What a mess!
I asked them to fix my car.
I know a good restaurant that's inexpensive.
I can't believe what an idiot I've been.
He lost his memory.
I always root for the underdog.
Typhoons hit Japan every year.
Did you mention my book?
He was absolved of all responsibility.
May I ask you to close the window?
That's what I wanted to hear.
I'll live on welfare.
You have to make up the time you have lost.
I should've finished that sooner.
I didn't want my mom to know.
Bacteria are invisible to the naked eye.
These shoes fit my feet.
I'm glad I invited you.
Are you envious?

Don't play with fire.
I don't like being controlled.
I just can't stand this hot weather anymore.
My uncle died of cancer two years ago.
The man sitting over there is a famous singer.
This bird cannot fly.
What's the daily rate?
That's what I should've said.
Is there something you want to ask?
Tom is chopping wood.
I'll need you to be there.
He is the fastest runner in our class.
Don't talk about yourself like that.
Do you know why she's so angry?
Tom began fixing dinner.
He is one of the best brains in our country.
Is that your umbrella?
I knew you could do it, Tom.
Can you determine what happened?
They love their children.
It's all here.
I quit a long time ago.
Did you see what I did?
Are you falling for me?
I promise you I'll come early.
I'm not going away.
Tom tripped over something.
Thank you for listening to me.
Do you think it'll rain this afternoon?
He put milk in his coffee.
I had to postpone my appointment.
I am short of money.
You're very observant.
I can't figure out anything.
Have you been told the reasons why we didn't hire you?
He is always at home on Mondays.
This is the place where the incident happened.
Don't you remember my name?
I have to admit I'm interested.
We have had little snow this winter.
She was supposed to call him at 2:30.
Tom can't say for sure when Mary will arrive.
I like your smile.
This telephone doesn't work.
She's no spring chicken.
If you want to know, just ask.
A number of cars are parked in front of my house.
You've always been that way.
Tom told a joke, but nobody laughed.
No matter what you may say, I won't change my mind.
It's just a placebo.
You are too critical of others' shortcomings.
Did I say you could talk?
I like my coffee without sugar.
I'm thinking about visiting my friend next year.
She greets him every morning as he enters the school building.
They all went to the restaurant.
We finally arrived at the lake.
Hold this.
He can speak Chinese a little.
Didn't you hear me calling?
We should wait.
I am sure that he will succeed.
You are what you eat.
Had you been drinking?
Would you please stop singing?
Are you still not convinced?
You don't have to apologize.
When do you go on holiday?
This book contains many pictures.
What a beautiful scene!
I write almost every day.
I'd like to reserve a table for two.
You're very emotional.
You must not stay in bed.
How can you be so selfish?
I thought we could get together later.
They just want to get to know you.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
Do you ever think about that guy?
She exuded nothing but confidence going into the final round.
You're overworked.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
How old were you when your family moved to Boston?
You seem to be a kind person.
It's the correct answer.
She would often practice the violin on the roof.
He said he could do it.
She asked him not to leave her alone.
Without your help, I would have drowned.
I still have trouble believing it.
You're all alone.
Do you have an airplane ticket back home?
Where are you having lunch today?
I didn't clean it.
Where did you hear that story?
You don't have to answer.
I had the feeling you were going to ask me that.
Can we have a minute alone?
He was held in captivity.
I was as surprised as you.
Next time you come, don't forget to give it back to me.
It's on fire.
I feel queasy.
My daughter had a concussion.
Turn it off.
Is this translation correct?
It seems to me that something is wrong.
I thought I heard you.
He came back from China.
I don't know how to reply to that question.
How tall are you, and how much do you weigh?
I found the key I was looking for.
English is spoken in many countries.
You ran a red light.
I'm a Japanese teacher.
The Japanese government can't cope with the problem.
I worked hard all day long yesterday.
I've got real feelings for you.
You forgot to mention that.
Tom is proud of his stamp collection.
Get in. I'll drive you somewhere.
Japanese houses are small.
Thanks for all you've done to make my special day such a memorable one.
Tom made many mistakes.
He's never been in love before.
I enjoyed the attention.
You look great in these photos.
I still have mine.
Tom couldn't answer the last question.
Are you here with anyone?
I don't really want to pay that much for a new car.
They were abandoned by their mother.
Wanna go upstairs and have a drink?
He's worried about his receding hairline.
All the stores were closed.
I have no idea what Tom said to Mary.
She worked for a rich man.
Please say it more loudly.
He was delighted at the result.
I was allowed to take a week off.
I'll join you in a moment.
It's raining again.
This child has been adopted.
All of us went to the theater to see a play.
I have to change clothes.
I'm from Croatia.
Are you seriously thinking about buying a computer from that store?
I would like some sugar, please.
I have no idea why it is so.
To the best of my knowledge, this chemical will prevent germs from breeding.
They have nothing against it.
Just at that time, the bus stopped.
We're concerned for your safety.
It is difficult to understand this novel.
How about 12:45?
He may have already departed.
He doesn't just speak French, he speaks Spanish as well.
Do you believe him?
How did you get out of your room?
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
This is the last game.
I thought that he was honest.
I never said you couldn't go.
Can I come in?
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
I'll be happy to work with you.
I met the principal himself.
Does that trouble you?
It did not last more than three minutes.
You're fascinating.
What are your conclusions?
They'll have to wait.
Philosophers tend to have little contact with the outside world.
I'll help you.
You're biased.
How many kids do you have?
We often talk about the weather.
He often tells us we must help one another.
How can I get to the station?
I don't trust talkative people.
The three boys had only two dollars among them.
I'd rather do this by myself.
Leave more space between the lines.
I don't know why I bother with you.
My first impression of him proved to be correct.
We cannot live without air.
I am a new student.
Are you on dope?
I will do anything to please her.
He tried to get rid of the ants.
You go first.
How much are we short?
I don't have a tattoo.
He proved to be a spy.
I used to use Twitter, but then found it a bit boring, so I stopped using it.
Don't tell me what I already know.
I didn't plan to hit Tom.
If you are free, give me a hand.
These three hours of driving have worn me out. Let's stop at the first rest area we see.
Don't trust anyone.
I want you to be prepared.
You can't put off doing that any longer.
You're productive.
He looks as if he were ill.
Take your hand out of your pocket.
I was amazed at his courage.
What are some foods you usually eat with a knife and fork?
Mary is Tom's fiancée.
The only thing that matters is that you weren't injured.
I bought the book for ten dollars.
Leave the room immediately.
We should use the electric blankets tonight.
I don't quite know yet.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
That boy denies stealing the bicycle.
What's the real reason you're here?
What if someone sees this?
Would you like to play soccer with us?
He sat next to her.
You should apologize to Tom for being late.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
I didn't walk.
Mary is now studying in her room.
We want to measure your blood pressure.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
What's it all mean?
All you do is criticize others.
Are you ready to begin?
They are very cheerful.
From here on out, it's smooth sailing.
He is at his office.
Aren't you thirsty?
I really don't get you.
Have you spoken to Tom?
Please wait outside of the house.
You're new here, aren't you?
I know what I like.
Everyone was smiling.
She can't control her children.
You're the owners.
You're naive.
Sign here.
There will be a lunar eclipse tomorrow.
The bus stop is across the street.
Check this out.
That sounded like a gunshot.
It's about time for dinner.
She wants him to be her friend.
Stop it right now!
An important function of policemen is to catch thieves.
He left his son a large fortune.
Where's the catch?
Lots of famous people come here.
I'll help you look for Tom.
The storm prevented me from leaving.
She has spent hours at the gym trying to lose weight.
Good luck convincing him.
While I was waiting for the streetcar, I witnessed a traffic accident.
He was right the first time.
I want to climb Mt. Fuji again.
I have fewer books than you.
We live in the United States.
I guess that's good for you.
I haven't seen him since last Sunday.
My sister asked me to lend her the dictionary.
It's getting larger.
We need to discuss this further.
I don't understand what you want to do.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
You probably just want to be alone.
He may have been ill.
Tom hates getting up early in the morning.
Tom sharpened a pencil.
Do you think I'm right?
We have enough time.
Tom followed me to the garage.
We just want to have fun.
Tom doesn't need to go.
He was sleeping under the tree.
Don't expect too much.
It was not easy for us to find his house.
All of them agreed to the proposal.
I'll tell everyone what you did.
What did you open it with?
She spoke up for him.
Do you fancy a drink?
Hey, where did you two come from?
At the end of the speech she repeated the word.
I actually saw a ghost.
That's not important now.
Think outside the box.
We weren't all that hungry.
I was cleaning.
You're not normal.
She found him standing near the entrance.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I thought a lot about what you said.
You've still got all your life in front of you.
I'm sure it's around here somewhere.
Is it a social problem?
Charge this bill to me.
After asking for my key at the front desk, I took the elevator to my floor.
No one ate any of the cookies that I made.
Tom is leaving.
It is impossible to put the plan into practice.
That's not your job.
It may or may not be true.
I am learning two foreign languages.
He is the last person to speak ill of others.
I don't need to talk about it.
I would rather starve than work under him.
A horseshoe and a four-leaf clover bring good luck.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Can we quit talking about this?
How can you fix it?
I mean you no harm.
I'm starting to believe that.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
She's fixing the machine.
I don't know exactly at what time she's coming.
Tom borrowed my ruler.
Do this work by tomorrow if at all possible.
He noticed straight away.
You're not fat.
Close that door.
You nearly broke my jaw.
Drop your weapons!
The president is difficult to approach.
Which applications do you like best?
We all laughed.
That's only part of the truth.
I know that you love Tom.
I wear glasses.
Please be seated, ladies and gentlemen.
He's waiting for the train to leave.
Don't forget what I just told you.
It sounds to me as if he has something to do with the matter.
Tom concentrated on his work.
Make a circle and hold hands.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
We are leaving for Hawaii tonight.
Do not say such foolish things.
The work has to be finished before noon.
Bring me my hat.
Tom finished washing the dishes.
He had a good look at the papers.
Would you happen to know what this is?
I caught them in the act.
I just want to do something fun.
Call me at 9:00 tomorrow.
Get down from your horse.
It is time for her to go home.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
I'm assuming this is your father.
Take one of these.
You can sleep on the couch.
Why aren't you already on board the ship?
There's no hope.
Do me a favor, will you?
Do you have a phone?
Your threats don't scare me at all.
We'd like a bottle of rosé.
I think we're looking for different things.
Prisons are euphemistically called rehabilitation centers.
British English differs from American English in many ways.
I am not alone in this opinion.
Tom got back in the car.
English cannot be mastered overnight.
Let's not argue.
I just want to talk to you.
Why are people scared of you?
How can I deactivate my account on this site?
I don't feel like eating anything.
Be ruthless.
Let me handle it.
She was in time for the bus.
This is all I can do.
This is an institution for the criminally insane.
School begins at 8:10 a.m.
I can't believe no one heard that.
Is this your book?
Stop crying.
I wasn't sure about that.
Excuse me, but would you please open the window?
I'm an agent.
I'd like to think about it.
The outcome of the upcoming election will be the hardest ever to predict.
Tom was guilty of spreading lies about Mary.
You're very busy.
The cat is in the well.
Here is the fish my mother baked.
I hate that.
Do you remember the day when we first met?
Have they spotted you?
Get into your car.
Hey, wait up!
I'm here to save you.
He fell asleep right away.
I want that.
I love your car.
We came together.
I need something else.
He was absent from school because he was sick.
Where are they swimming?
The fugitive crossed the river.
Once washed, the lining will look brand new.
The provisions ran out after a short time.
What have you eaten today?
You might want to take a look at this.
The sisters hate each other.
I'll not make that mistake again.
We are sure of his success.
She blamed him for all her problems.
It's kind of disgusting.
The population of this city is on the increase.
Some of us might be willing to go.
Will you take me there?
He'll do anything to score some drugs.
He had his car stolen in that parking lot.
I'm going to be gone soon.
Something is missing.
He went skiing.
He was disappointed at not being invited.
I really didn't have time.
I want to convey my sympathy.
He never saw his brother again.
They were attacked.
Could I say something, please?
You can get a lot of bang for your buck at this store.
Who can run fastest in your class?
What color do you like?
Tom inherited the business from his father.
This is the village where my father was born.
How accurate is it?
He cracked up.
Don't let them get to you.
Are you sure that's safe?
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
It takes time to develop political awareness.
Can I be honest?
May I suggest another strategy?
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
Like father, like son.
I give you my word.
You have a lot of nerve!
I don't have a bicycle.
I am doing my homework.
I want your love.
It's all a big misunderstanding.
I'm afraid the rumor is true.
I sure hope there's nothing wrong with it.
I'm not narrow-minded.
She's two years older than him.
That's a no-brainer.
Here we are!
The water was warm.
They were afraid of being overheard.
We should do this more often.
He has been on a diet for two months.
That's what you get for not listening.
I have to put my shoes on.
I don't have any objection to that.
I am new here.
Dad's always encouraging him.
It was just a coincidence.
I want you to know that I can't be there tomorrow.
Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
Why are these photos so important?
That was cool.
I want to confess.
Is this the key you are looking for?
We know you're not stupid.
You won't have a chance.
I forgave you a long time ago.
He's right behind you.
He was a Roman Catholic.
I don't like apples.
Leave this to me.
Don't waste your time.
All of us were shocked by the news.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
You look a little shaken.
That's the worst thing you can do!
Tom is still outside.
What happens when we run out of water?
We’ve been waiting for hours.
He's bound to notice your mistake.
I love that chair.
We can't afford that.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
Take the apple and divide it into halves.
It started as a hobby.
That's the main gate.
How much does this cost?
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
You're very good.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
No one knew it.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
They want you dead.
She asked me whether I know how to sew.
Is aggression natural, or is it learned?
Tom could have told me the truth.
We were soldiers.
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one away.
Commit these words to memory.
I had no idea you knew how to play mahjong.
I don't have any choice.
Where are the others?
I'm afraid it's going to rain tomorrow.
Read as much as possible.
It can't wait.
You are sharp.
I felt ill.
The party is to be held next Sunday, weather permitting.
I don't have a ticket.
His failure is due to his ignorance.
She advised him to stop drinking.
Have some coffee.
You're the sweetest.
I'm not ashamed to tell you.
You're fired.
Do stop talking and listen to the music.
Why don't you go talk to him?
I really have to go now.
I have some other appointments.
I don't understand German at all.
I'm not your brother.
May I call you tomorrow?
You reek of alcohol.
I didn't deserve to go to prison.
Tom and Mary came to an understanding.
We're smashed.
I speak for all people.
I'm so grateful to you for this opportunity.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
Naples is a picturesque city.
The heavy fog made it impossible for us to see anything in front of us.
He's a senior.
I was in London most of the summer.
How tall you are!
It's bedtime.
I must concentrate.
Do you have a chain saw I could borrow?
He knows us very well.
I was scared that you might leave me.
To my astonishment, my money was gone.
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me.
I'm afraid of not finishing it in time.
You're the last person I expected to see here.
People of your age often have this problem.
I'm not avoiding you.
You're such a flirt.
It almost worked.
He wondered why she did not come.
I guess you didn't quite understand me.
We're shy.
What are we going to do?
These new computers can crunch data faster than ever.
He wore a dark sweater.
Tom closed his eyes.
I didn't forget.
Go straight on down this street.
We have all the details.
It's a real bargain.
This is a real diamond, isn't it?
I won't go with you unless you tell me where we're going.
She needed someone who would understand her.
When he reached the station, the train had already left almost half an hour before.
Tom will likely accept your offer.
What did you eat for lunch today?
My house has a small yard.
Tom doesn't think it's his fault.
That's what I was going to say.
Please tell Tom that Mary called.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Were you excited?
You amuse me.
I know something's going on.
A group of children were playing in the park.
You can have either of these, but not both.
It had started to rain.
You were my friend.
"Will you pass me the sugar?" "Here you are."
Beat it.
Do not open your book.
He can speak a little English.
This is the restaurant that I often eat at.
I think he's a man of ability.
You can have both.
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
This booklet is free of charge.
I am going to buy a new car.
Have you told everyone where the meeting will be?
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
Don't give him any ideas.
You're going to have to pay for the repair.
Do you really want to buy a car now?
How many boys are in this class?
Tom made a promise to himself that he would never make the same mistake again.
We all chipped in to buy our teacher a birthday present.
That tastes terrible.
I read that report before lunch.
I like to be prepared.
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
How is this relevant?
Keep searching.
How was your day?
Someday I will buy a cotton candy machine.
He fixed the net.
We won't forgive you.
I really don't want to live here.
He sat next to her.
I lost track of time.
He's an expert with a slingshot.
I love my home.
I gave him a few books.
I was caught in a shower on my way home.
I don't have time to argue with you.
She forgave him for losing all her money.
I should've been honest with you.
Tom doesn't want to discourage Mary.
Don't you ever come back.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
The room is full of people.
I thought Tom did a nice job.
They had a debate on same-sex marriage.
We must look at the problem from a global point of view.
The frogs' croaking helped me fall asleep.
He stopped talking.
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
We did nothing wrong. It was only a kiss.
I stayed longer than I thought I would.
She gave me a shy smile.
You must steer clear of that gang.
I'm managing.
He never laughs.
Give me some coffee if there is any left.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
It wasn't made of wood.
I can't talk right now. I need to go.
He wished he had more time.
That word describes it perfectly.
I doubt that our new boss will be any worse than the old one.
Let me handle it.
Call me when you get settled in.
Are you out of your mind?
Are you willing to make a deal?
I'm content with my salary.
When did I give you that?
I can't believe we've never done this before.
He may have told a lie.
I think it's time for me to turn off the TV.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
He cannot play guitar.
It's what you deserve.
I'm lazy.
I like it when you do that.
How tall is he?
We must do away with these old rules.
Her mother has gone shopping.
That man has a very good build.
There wasn't enough.
You're so sweet.
I will give you what little money I have.
What a great idea!
Can you believe this is already happening?
The phone was off the hook.
I am in London.
She is living in the middle of nowhere.
They're gone.
I will do it by all means.
Look at that building.
I have nothing left to say.
What style of furniture would you like?
How many of these are yours?
I talk to myself.
I can't believe how beautiful you are.
I didn't quite catch the name of that designer.
You're very timid.
Don't you know what it is?
It was very windy.
I have little interest in history.
Letters are delivered every day.
Can I talk to you about your son?
It won't be that hard.
He skipped a grade.
Keep to the right.
I can explain this.
Why go to all that trouble?
His finances have changed for the better.
I can't believe you actually said that.
What an awful mother!
It's not going to end well.
You need a keycard to open the door.
Our lives are determined by our environment.
How many sandwiches are there left?
We waited outside.
He started washing his car.
Why did he quit his job?
Do you mind if we join you?
He fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
How much did I lose?
Do you like mine?
Here she comes.
You should listen to his advice.
I never want to leave you again.
Please help yourself to the cake.
Show me your passport, please.
Remember to mail this letter.
We always play tennis on Saturday morning.
Our team lost the first game.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
Are you ready to go?
Your team is stronger than ours.
The enemy has demanded our surrender.
I must obey.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
We're not ready.
That was our first encounter.
That's an interesting piece of information.
They can't fire you.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
I am afraid it's too late.
He picked up a mirror and looked at his tongue.
Her red dress made her stand out.
We've all seen it.
My boss is keeping me pretty busy.
If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
Nobody can help me.
You're insane.
He couldn't help laughing at it.
I forget who said it.
We're finally alone.
I'm glad you're early.
There aren't any fish living in this river anymore.
He wrote me a love letter.
He jumped out of bed.
I'd never do what Tom did.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Did you go to see a doctor?
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I saw my mother hide the cake.
I was starving.
I was trying to kill time.
You're the oldest.
I tried to avoid conflict.
They agreed to start early.
Tom hid behind a tree.
It's really hot there.
I'm sure I can persuade Tom.
I appreciate your telling me.
Can I ask you something personal?
Are they cops?
Tell me what to do and I will do it.
We need some more water.
The bishop took pity on the desperate immigrants.
Tom goes swimming every day.
I have terrible pains.
I used to watch this anime a lot when I was a kid, but I can't quite remember what happened to the hero in the final episode.
Is that really all there is?
Tom started washing his car.
I'd like a receipt, please.
You are not consistent.
Almost everybody has already gone home.
The diamond was set in a gold ring.
She takes after her mother in every respect.
We're newcomers.
Give them to me.
Don't tell anyone this.
I need some medicine to kill the pain.
My mom told me that I was fat.
We didn't find it.
That was quick.
That's really nice to hear.
I appreciate your efforts to help me.
Tom and I are separated.
That wasn't my intention.
Tom asked me to come here.
I don't know who any of you are.
What're you saying?
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
I thought he might come.
You must kneel at my feet, kiss my hand and swear that I am an angel.
We're all OK.
I made a few changes.
Show me an example.
He's almost as tall as me.
No matter how hard I try, I can't remember the exact words.
Your criticism is unfair.
When he retired, his son took over his business.
Have you ever been stuck in an elevator?
It doesn't matter how old you are.
You won't be interested.
I just need to be alone.
I didn't graduate.
He told me about it.
I can hardly wait to get started.
Don't put words in my mouth.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
He walks to school.
Let me think it over for a couple of days.
Did you notice her new dress?
I expected that he would come.
It's a good thing to read good books when you are young.
Tom is a very good cook.
Are you sure we're allowed to swim here?
I needed a change.
I saw a boy crossing the street.
I didn't hear her coming.
They'll all be here tonight.
It's an ambitious project.
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
How did you know my name?
Everyone is unique.
Was anybody else hurt?
Management hid the true financial state of the company from the workers.
He lured her away from her husband.
She repulses him.
I envy you.
Since I've been on this diet, my weight is down, my cholesterol is down and my sleep apnea has completely disappeared.
It is a luxury cruise.
Aren't you afraid of anything?
Can I rely on you?
I just wanted to check my email.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I saw him crossing the street.
His ideas never earned him a single penny.
My hip hurts.
You are my father.
I need you right now.
There's a table.
No one noticed.
Those glasses suit you.
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
Shut the door, please.
I've been expecting good news from them.
He pushed me gently.
Please call me up between seven and eight.
Why can't we do that?
I did it without you.
He drank himself to death.
A lot of young people your age are already working and have a family.
I would like for him to write more often.
It's not anybody's fault.
There are no chairs in this room.
Your mother loves me.
I could use some advice.
It took me several hours to translate it.
Men don't drive as well as women.
If you know what's good for you, you'll quit doing that.
I accept your challenge.
I imagine that you went through a lot of difficulties.
I was nine years old when I asked my mom if Santa Claus really existed.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
He was surprised by what he learned.
Now is the time for action.
I'm a normal girl.
Newspapers carry weather reports.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
She's very upset.
Do you want to stay?
Why are you interested?
What'd the doctor say?
You better get some sleep.
We cannot live without air and water.
It's right.
Could you please fix this flat tire?
He taught me how to spell the word.
Come and see me tomorrow.
He's an old timer.
You can't kill us all.
We can't be the only two people who forgot to pay our bills on time.
I hope we're going to do something worthwhile.
He's an author.
You speak French very well. I wish I could speak it as well as you.
My brother is ambidextrous.
I don't know if we're going to be able to do that.
I'll write you as soon as I arrive there.
I don't know about you, but I feel pretty good today.
We're less than halfway to the top of the mountain. Are you already tired?
Can I take a break now?
Insects are arthropods.
Look at that pole in the square.
Hey, wait a minute, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I just don't want you to get upset.
I feel like my head is going to explode.
They arrived too soon.
We're still involved.
We went there for a week.
He put on the black coat.
Please have some copies made.
I'm too tired to think about this problem now.
Honesty is a virtue.
I am from Russia.
He works at night.
What's the big deal?
He gets a kick out of reckless driving.
I'll keep this for future use.
To tell you the truth, I'm completely bored.
I was trapped.
Dad needs to take a rest. He's been working in the garden for three hours.
Are you looking for me?
You're very talented.
I was tricked into doing it.
I'm also learning French.
They all entered.
The industry is heavily dependent on government funding.
There's nothing more to say.
Did you just hear what you said?
My brother wants to go to the moon some day.
She is missing the point.
Do you guys need a lift?
Will you join our club?
They were pretty tired after having worked all day.
I like that song.
I've been thinking about you, too.
My boys are all grown up.
He's a construction worker.
Tom is the best man for the job.
Tom is a correctional officer.
I intend to stay in Nagoya for three days.
I'd like a chance to make myself clear.
I don't live with Tom.
Why didn't you call me last night?
He lost his honor.
Stop me if you can.
Tom doesn't usually play backgammon.
I need an extra pillow.
Someone knocked on the door.
We don't know the answer yet.
It was just water.
Whenever I go to a Japanese restaurant, I take the disposable chopsticks home with me.
Someone is watching you.
By hard work we can achieve anything.
I have a hangover.
I missed you kids.
He claims that he is honest.
I thought you were asleep.
It's not about them.
Thank you for stopping by.
The experience gave him an advantage over the others.
Which cup is yours?
Have you already met him?
Do you have a house?
Have you seen a little girl with short black hair?
She was more beautiful than all of the others.
What did you make?
It is necessary that we provide for the future.
You're too skinny.
They had fun with us.
He has none of his father's aggressiveness.
Is it time you need?
Be still.
She doesn't mince words.
I wonder if he's at home.
World War II ended in 1945.
You have a good memory.
Why don't you start by telling us where you went?
What're you good at?
They live on the floor beneath.
I am afraid of bears.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
I thought you'd want to try some Japanese food.
Tom pulled the rope.
You're courageous.
None of these eggs are fresh.
She works in a bank.
Nobody really cared that Tom didn't help.
Tom passed away last year.
The box is made of wood.
You've missed the boat.
Please choose a stronger password.
Tom was very patient.
I bumped into an old friend on the bus.
Do you enjoy working from home?
He had the nerve to say that.
I ate something earlier this evening that didn't agree with me.
Her father works at the bank.
I used to think it didn't really matter what I fed my dog.
Help me out here.
He married my sister.
You have been warned.
We don't have any strawberry ice cream.
I want to focus on the future.
I'm trying to find a lawyer to handle my case.
I'm not going to play this game.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
She betrayed you.
Tom kept on talking even though Mary had fallen asleep.
This is the man that I see every day on the train.
I have one.
Do you ever think about that girl?
The rivers were flooded by the heavy rain.
The kitchen lacks a dishwasher.
Iceland entered into an alliance with France.
Do it right.
You're shy.
What line of work are you in?
Bring your student ID!
That is your book.
I'd like to run a few more tests.
You're not too late.
Don't be mean.
How are you planning to do that?
Tom is left-handed, but he writes with his right hand.
Which floor do you live on?
That's all we saw.
The crowd poured out of the auditorium.
This word has three syllables.
You gave me your word that you would look after them.
Listen to your mother.
There is a letter for you.
Tom didn't know anyone in the room.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
The storm caused a lot of damage.
He hesitated before answering.
I don't see eye to eye with my father.
I want to ask you some questions.
My sister works in a bank as a secretary.
I was hurt by many people.
They invited them to dinner.
He smoked a cigar after lunch.
Strangely enough, he failed.
You have no right to oppose our plan.
Please sing.
I have enough money to buy it.
Everything he says upsets me.
Choose either one or the other.
What is your idea of a good time?
I'll go wherever you want me to go.
Please sit down!
I agree with him.
That old man is a fussy eater.
Tom doesn't smile very often.
You can't count on him for financial help.
We found something.
Have you already eaten?
Lawyers are all liars.
Tom has a good memory, too.
You can't go there.
According to the X-ray, everything is all right.
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Are you telling me the truth?
She taught him everything she knew.
Are you settling in?
You have dirty feet.
Sorry, the line is busy now.
You missed the meeting.
Did you live here before?
Am I fired?
They refused.
This food is gluten-free.
He lost his memory.
Do you have any money?
Any further discussion is pointless.
Why does Tom always look so tired?
I have a lot of things to do.
Drinks are on me.
Please come here.
I didn't expect to see you here.
The mountain was covered with snow.
They look so cute together.
He was a real drunkard.
We've already met.
This has shaken my faith in the institutions of government.
I've lost it.
That's his.
Do you like Wagner?
Ethnic minorities struggle against prejudice and poverty.
You speak French, don't you?
You're a liar.
May I introduce myself to you?
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
She forgave him.
I'm pretty sure that it won't snow today.
What a big boy he is!
We will soon be having snow.
I think that she's honest.
Tom had no other choice but to help Mary clean out the garage.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
How long have you been planning this wedding?
I love spending time with you.
I feel hungry.
For the time being, my sister is an assistant in a supermarket.
An argument may be logically sound without being true.
I'm not sure what's wrong. We should have heard from him by now.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
We receive many telephone calls from abroad.
Have I kept you waiting?
It was not until I reached home that I missed my purse.
She has him under her thumb.
It's harder than it looks.
A bat is no more a bird than a rat is.
I do not know who is good enough for him.
Why is this so expensive?
I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.
I need you to do me a favor.
We believe the time of death was 2:20 p.m.
Who are we competing against?
I think Tom is in love with you.
You must be very busy these days.
I'll do your homework for you.
Life doesn't always go the way we want it to.
What hotel will you be staying at?
His sister looks young.
My heart began to beat fast.
Rigor mortis sets in soon after death.
We look up to him as our teacher.
I want you to tell me who gave you that.
Tom has no close friends.
How can I ever forgive myself?
Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?
I'm going to be your teacher.
Perhaps that's true.
He looks to his uncle for advice whenever he is in trouble.
They're about to leave.
I think I've figured out where we need to install the fire alarm.
We're married.
I'll never be that famous.
He took her out for a drive.
I'll miss you very much if you go.
Tom works in advertising.
I have many model cars.
What time is your plane scheduled to take off?
We will not surrender.
You're very clever.
She knit him a sweater for his birthday.
He looks confused.
You are beautiful.
Do you like French wines?
I don't remember what it was about.
I'm glad you're my friend.
There are two zeros in the number "2010."
Why don't you talk to him?
How's everything going?
Please sum up your idea.
He ran as fast as he could.
It snowed.
We caught you.
Have you written a book?
I like cookies.
The prisoner was given his freedom.
Please don't forget to mail this letter.
Do you think that handguns should be made illegal?
Where was he headed?
He didn't know what to do with the extra food.
Welcome home.
The TV was on all the time.
A word spoken is past recalling.
Maybe she can tell you more.
It is a pity that you can't join us.
Don't ask questions, just come with me.
It is said that he knows the secret.
I saw her home.
The dog bit my hand.
She sat next to him and listened quietly.
I know you want to make me happy.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
The police arrested the suspect.
There is no air on the moon.
Stop teasing me.
They must have had an accident.
Either you or I am wrong.
You can't stop progress.
Have a seat.
Stop worrying about it.
Did you like the movie?
I suppose I've got to get my feet wet sometime.
This is the very book you wanted.
I have fewer books than you.
He always keeps his promises.
Can you think of any reason why that might be the case?
There is a big stack of mail on the table.
It was a divine intervention.
Is there something wrong with your phone?
I want to know if you will be free tomorrow.
He asked us to help him.
It's obvious.
I had met him many times before then.
It's our duty to help.
Who do you live with?
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
She trusts him.
Nobody was home.
Tom didn't give us any details.
We can't live even one more day without water.
The fruit went bad.
She's at the hotel now.
Will it take long to recover?
I didn't tell that guy my name.
He can't see nor hear.
They don't despise you.
Are you tired of living?
Can anyone help?
You can't give up now.
Do you have much snow here?
I'd like to change some money.
That was really unfair.
I prefer reading.
Everyone started arguing.
Be more careful from now on.
They are the same age.
Her father became an invalid as a result of a heart attack.
Interest rates and inflation were high.
I'm sure Tom will be home soon.
He left his wife.
Today it's very sunny, so everyone is wearing sunglasses.
Where does this train go?
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
I drank tea yesterday.
Let's go somewhere tonight, OK?
I just posted a great picture of wombats on Flickr.
My toe started bleeding.
There's a large risk involved.
I want my children to have dual citizenship.
Press this button to start the machine.
She passed the examination.
The girl wanted to tell him the truth, but she couldn't.
Tom ran towards the bushes.
What's life like where you live?
I can't help doubting his honesty.
How did he come by this money?
We'll have a better chance of surviving if we stay calm.
He works with me at the office.
I passed on the job to him.
I cannot thank you too much.
Small businesses are often absorbed by a major company.
Tom can't do even simple arithmetic.
That's a filthy job and I don't want to do it.
Please turn the television on.
I didn't hear a splash.
He turned a somersault.
We saw you.
The bellows are not working.
I have a lot to learn.
They want me to organize the party.
I'm from Brazil.
The bad weather affected his health.
I'm still married.
Tom is the fattest person I know.
The old man gave her a small doll.
Why do you keep giving him money?
I'll never forget what you told me.
I can protect you.
This is a good deal.
You're fashionable.
I'm done listening to you.
I heard everything.
Do you like my new haircut?
Let me take your temperature.
You're very emotional.
I'm starting to like you.
Is this your favorite song?
Where was Tom born?
Tell the maid to make the beds.
Do you have a better idea?
The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union collapsed.
My girlfriend is crying.
That's not at all funny.
We went to Boston by bus.
It's amazing that so many people cross this street when the light is red.
The population is growing.
It's all quite simple.
It's time to get out of here.
I see you've made a friend.
That's why he got up early.
You should take my advice.
You're a very lucky man.
We're safe here.
What a beautiful scene!
I wonder if he will come.
Some animals are afraid of fire.
She's been feeling a little on edge recently.
The girls are excited.
We should have told him the truth.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
Tom is already waiting.
Please tell me what happened.
They adore Tom.
You're kind of cute.
Children need a lot of sleep.
He asked me if I knew her telephone number.
American politics are interesting to watch, especially during a presidential election.
I think Tom did well.
I'd like to dance with you.
There are no food stores in the immediate area.
Tom's eyelids were half open.
The girl entered the room.
I would like to make a phone call.
The road up and the road down is one and the same.
Tom didn't take a shower.
Tom doesn't know how to tie his shoes.
I must help you.
I had to go back home.
He was among those chosen.
I am not like you.
Is everything all right in there?
I'm taking it seriously.
Will you go, too?
When are you going to get married?
I'm a university student.
I don't really know what that means.
Tom couldn't stop laughing.
Cheese doesn't digest easily.
I feel different today.
It is an endangered species.
You have a lot of nerve!
Either you or I will have to do it.
This is something I need to do alone.
It is not easy to learn a foreign language.
The cat is lazy.
It's about time.
Where's my bag?
It is rather warm today.
That's the last thing I remember.
They are very kind.
They abandoned their homeland.
Stop being so naive.
It has been confirmed.
Have you ever been kissed before?
Hit the lights and let's go.
Tom isn't friendly.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
Strictly speaking, you are wrong.
Her grandmother lived to be 88 years old.
Keep out of my way.
I'd leave.
I'm not accustomed to such treatment.
Do you care to hazard a guess?
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
He has absolute power.
I'm not coming back here.
I can't get you out of my head.
Are you Chinese?
My wife wanted to adopt a child.
I'll let you know later.
I'm very sleepy.
I never saw Tom again.
There's something I want to try.
How big you are!
It's the shortest route to Paris.
You are not supposed to smoke here.
Are you proud of me?
I'll call you when I get there.
All you have to do is write it down.
It was here that I saw her.
How long does it take to get to the beach?
Do you have anything hot to drink?
He told me that his father was dead.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
I should go with you.
What's the air temperature today?
It's been a long time since I last spoke French.
They left very early in the morning.
Tom folded his shirts.
Why do bees die after stinging?
I hear you're good at French.
I am looking for a good hotel.
I saw something.
You're very funny.
I thought you might want to know.
I don't see what you're so concerned about.
When it comes to marital spats, there's usually two sides to the story.
I think what you're doing is dangerous.
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
What are they doing here?
I am making too many mistakes.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
If something is wrong, tell me.
You played hooky yesterday?
It's almost time to go to bed.
My father will be back at the beginning of next month.
I can assure you that honesty pays in the long run.
You're conceited.
Tom looked at the tall man suspiciously.
I will come to your country some day.
They want to become rich.
Don't touch the stove.
She married him only because her parents made her.
Someone is at the door.
Tom lost his hat.
This problem is difficult for me to solve.
Could you drive more slowly?
I don't want to play.
Please speak in a louder voice.
We have no chance.
Don't cross this bridge.
They're right behind you.
This conversation is a masterpiece.
I have an attraction for older, chubby women.
I can't stay long. I have plans.
I hope Tom didn't tell anybody I was here.
I'm not giving you any more money.
You're very kind, Tom.
Everything is better without you.
Tom still has feelings for you.
He made friends with Tom.
How can I get to the police station?
Here's what you should do.
She disliked him.
I don't disagree with your decision.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
You are sure to succeed, whatever you do.
Her kindness touched me.
You're not very funny.
As soon as I finish writing the report, I'll send it to you.
Why are you cursing?
I'll ignore that.
He's not going.
I hate my brother.
We're as hungry as wolves.
I have an appointment I don't want to be late for.
This storm is not dangerous. You don't need to worry.
Nobody backed up what I said.
I think we've already wasted too much time.
He asked a very good question.
I have always considered you a close friend.
I thought you were older than me.
Where were you coming from?
Tom went straight to bed.
I don't belong here.
They're very fond of him.
I really am glad you're here.
I'm innocent.
I figured I could count on you.
Are you hiring?
We're not together anymore.
I don't believe any of this.
Everyone was OK.
Are you seeing anybody right now?
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to lock the door.
Tomorrow I must leave earlier.
I'm too tired to walk any longer.
It's a type of body piercing.
If I were in her place, I wouldn't give up yet.
They were all surprised to see me there.
She prides herself on her skill in cooking.
He got lost in the city.
What's wrong with you?
I feel very sick.
Don't touch that button!
You should not go alone.
This is the only book I have.
Do you have a lot of time?
I want a martini.
He is rarely, if ever, late for appointments.
What has become of him?
May I see your invitation please?
You're very skeptical.
Tom often goes shopping alone.
The street was very empty.
I must hurry to class.
It is your right.
I guess we were happy back then.
I'm going to Japan with my girlfriend in August.
They clung together for warmth.
Shake before using.
Do you know how to get to our place?
I can't believe we've finally finished the project.
You can't handle the truth.
Watch your speed.
I want to set the record straight.
You've turned up at the right moment.
I want to go swimming with Tom.
Tom wished that he could play tennis as well as Mary.
I've never felt like this before.
You need to attach your photo to the application form.
It's too expensive.
We all like him.
That's just what you needed.
Are you ready to party?
He did not speak at all.
Which film did you see?
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
How's your old lady doing?
It's time to clean your room.
I wish I could take back all those terrible things I said about you last night.
I think we should make a deal.
Have you met her?
My sister will prepare breakfast.
I cannot give you a definite answer today.
We'll never get through it.
His behavior was anything but polite.
That guy is always asking his parents for money.
We saw her when leaving the house.
Where exactly did you go?
Tom doesn't seem to understand any French.
Don't worry. I'm good at this.
I feel completely restored after a week in the country.
Tomorrow morning will be OK.
The sun has set.
They painted their toenails.
I could not eat another bite.
This river is very dangerous to swim in.
I got goosebumps.
That's the computer on which he writes his articles.
I only ask out of curiosity.
I've heard you've been sick.
I haven't eaten yet.
That shouldn't be too hard to get.
Is it only about money?
We thought it wise not to continue our trip.
Tom got remarried recently.
We caught him red-handed.
I wash my hands before eating lunch.
Do you need a ride?
Take one of these.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
I'll be there right away.
The people listened to the speaker attentively.
You should put on some clothes.
Should I be worried?
You'll have to drive.
How about we go for a drink?
Something is odd here.
Were you happy?
I'm totally confused.
She's not a liar.
You can take it.
I go to bed very early.
Does anyone know you're here?
I think the wind's dropping off.
You're the one I've been wanting to meet.
The university bears the name of its founder.
I will teach you.
She goes to market every day to buy things.
I went to Canada when I was a child.
After his wife died, he lived for quite a few more years.
Come tomorrow morning.
Who wants to go hunting?
You look smart.
Tom is really busy, isn't he?
He moved close to her.
I didn't even know Tom had a girlfriend.
This is dangerous territory.
What period is this painting from?
Is there a milkman?
You killed my mother.
Tom doesn't drink coffee.
Our cat's fur has lost its luster.
We do this kind of thing all the time.
His birthday just happens to be the same as mine.
You like it, don't you?
It was nice meeting you here.
Just mind your own business, please.
I was taken in by his good looks and gracious manners.
You've got to be bold!
I just didn't want to upset you.
She advised him to go on a strict diet.
I think Tom didn't understand you.
They established a Japanese language class for the refugees.
You work here, don't you?
I'm suddenly tired.
They set a new record for the longest kiss.
I just want to be a good neighbor.
We have to make a decision.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.
Are you seriously thinking about getting a divorce?
How will I pay my debts now?
You look tired.
It happened that I was in Paris then.
Am I talking too fast?
What are the rules?
I have only a small garden.
Don't waste your time on trifles.
I was too scared to do anything.
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
The plane will land before long.
I got a shave and a haircut.
I have been waiting for almost half an hour.
You're mistaken.
Is this the dictionary you're looking for?
Are there any Chinese restaurants near here?
We're the best.
I could have you arrested.
Will surgery help it?
What I need is a friend.
It looks like she has a lot of friends.
I bought that record in this store.
You can't just barge in here whenever you feel like it.
Tom always yells at Mary every time she does something stupid.
Tom fell over and landed flat on his face.
I'm not overly concerned.
The teacher omitted the exercise on page 21 of the book.
You know it doesn't matter.
Why is love so difficult?
I must open the window.
We were very busy last week.
They all looked happy.
I ate apples.
We took turns driving the car.
This is worth one million yen.
You should assume that anything you do online is public.
Her mother became mad at us.
They didn't see anything.
He got very drunk.
A lot of students around the world are studying English.
Tom is staying.
Don't you always do what's expected?
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
Tom looks happy.
I'm going to be gone soon.
I can afford neither the time nor the money for a trip.
Where will you be?
I don't know how Tom got my phone number.
He didn't come to school yesterday.
It is too expensive for me to buy.
I didn't think you were coming.
The blouse is clean.
Is your name on the list?
Dr. Smith has a lot of patients.
Does that guy look familiar to you?
That seems highly unlikely.
The typewriter is stored in the basement.
Tom is getting old.
I feel lost.
Where will you have lunch today?
He's English.
This will keep you warm.
I will play the guitar for you.
Don't trust anyone.
Have you seen Tom medical records?
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
You only have to ask for it.
I care about all of you.
She's a beauty.
Is the bank open?
If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave.
I'm glad to be here.
We're changing it.
Mother decided otherwise.
Let's listen to this cassette.
I tried to maintain my composure.
May comes after April.
This would be a mistake.
His teaching methods are highly unorthodox.
I'll be waiting for you at the usual place.
Something is not right.
I will need your help.
What did you do with that?
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
I finally escaped.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I'm sorry I didn't make it to your party.
Tom is too stubborn to apologize.
I'll stay with Tom until you return.
I met my teacher on the way to the station.
Tom was in trouble financially.
Go home. Get some rest.
You can go from Washington to New York by train.
She was talking all the time.
Mary and I became good friends.
Tom is quite straightforward.
I just can't believe this.
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
He was sentenced to community service.
I want to make something clear.
Do you like your classmates?
We're right here.
She went there to swim.
Right now, all I want to do is sleep for a few hours.
Tom isn't able to come today.
Catch me if you can.
He handles horses well.
This is the most enjoyable thing I've ever done.
Am I stupid?
I just gave up.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
May I have a class schedule?
Have him come.
I lost control.
He tried to solve the problem, but had no luck.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
I'm glad to see that you're studying harder than you used to.
Stop screaming in my ears.
He teaches English.
She devoted herself to him.
She went out to buy some food.
Tell me it's not true.
Business is looking up.
Please speak more slowly.
I wanted the best.
The water is pure.
Tom decided to call the police.
I burst out laughing.
After that, I didn't see him again.
I will get you a bicycle for your birthday.
How often do you go abroad?
May I sit next to you?
I have a right to be happy.
Don't deny it.
My bicycle was stolen.
Dig a deep hole.
Do you really believe in that stuff?
He sat surrounded by young girls.
It's on the house.
These pens are his.
You can do it, too.
What a bore!
We know very little about the cause of this disease.
My car ran out of gas.
It's not a pyramid scheme.
Turn down the music.
The feeling is mutual.
You can't give up.
I'm looking forward to going hunting with my father.
Let's begin with this problem.
Why are you speaking so loudly?
I've been thinking about it the entire day.
She isn't married.
I wonder if what I wrote was correct.
Do you have any questions?
He gave us not only clothes but some money.
Tom is too young to drink beer.
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow.
Who's had enough?
I'll be waiting for you outside.
I'm sure I will find a way.
You three are under arrest.
Practice is the only way to master foreign languages.
I called my neighbors over for dinner.
They'll kill you.
Please don't call the cops.
They agreed to give us an interview.
I showed my room to Tom.
I haven't eaten anything all day, but I don't feel hungry.
They did not keep their word.
He has earned a lot of money.
I've no idea.
She gave him something to drink.
They want this.
That's not what you said before.
He knows ten languages.
Did you have fun?
He promised not to tell.
I thought that you were able to speak French.
Tom knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
I was asked to fix the bicycle.
I'm going to bed.
Did I win something?
She decided not to go.
We've got a situation here, you know.
Get on the bus.
We all deserve to go.
She painted the wall red.
That was a pretty stupid thing to do.
I found this under your bed.
I know you are hiding yourself behind the curtain.
There's one problem with this.
I need pens, notebooks and so on.
This word comes from Greek.
I got him to clean my room.
I hope they have a pleasant journey.
It was all worth it.
Don't you think most Japanese students work hard?
It's an inside joke.
Sorry, I can't help you.
Would you come with us?
I was very flattered.
It doesn't make much sense to me, but Tom has decided not to go to college.
It's kind of embarrassing.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
Can you understand the meaning of this sentence?
I thought I could deal with it.
What good would come of it?
A cold wind was blowing.
I don't need your protection.
Do you know the difference between a microscope and a telescope?
The bridge is approximately a mile long.
I'll go anyway.
I'll be direct.
It will be finished in a day or two.
Tom warned Mary.
Always arrive on time.
Don't try this at home.
I went inside.
Why do you want me to wait in here?
Which floor do you live on?
They are all very happy.
Tom quickly figured it out.

She baked me a cake.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
Smallpox was unknown to Native Americans.
I don't know the reason he is absent today.
What exactly happened?
I appreciate you stopping by.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
What do you think happens then?
Are you here with anyone?
They did not keep their word.
Maybe we can find someplace to park further up the street.
I cooked him dinner.
I know you don't love me.
I just don't think this is funny.
He memorized that poem when he was five years old.
We stayed at the Dorchester.
We're not killers.
That's my dog.
He learned how to swim.

That was close.
I had a crush on you when we were in high school.
That dog is big.
That might be difficult.
I'm in charge of security.
Tom hoped to get back together with Mary.
She advised him not to use too much salt.
He has this large room to himself.
Do you have them?
She gets tired quickly.
You've found a good man.
I asked them to fix my car.
Do you know where they come from?
Don't mention this to anyone.
Do you have someplace to stay?
I don't think anyone thinks you're crazy.
I saw somebody kiss Tom.
Give me the microphone.
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I have the wrong number.
Be polite, but firm.
Reading makes me happy.
You should get married again.
He thinks that she will leave.
I really do just want to go.
Do the police know about this?
I can't swim.
He worked hard to provide for his family.
Stop filming.
Tom underwent surgery.
I can't believe you actually did that.
My aunt died an old spinster.
Everybody was disguised, so I couldn't tell who was who.
How many ways are there to do that?
I can be there in an hour.
We'd better leave him alone.
I don't really have a choice.
Why don't you take the day off?
That's all I remember.
You can't keep something that big a secret.
It was cold, so we lit a fire.
Though it was a muggy night, she went to bed with all the windows closed.

Were you even tempted?
They hugged.

He was a general in the Second World War.
I wanted to show you this.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
I got really mad.
The tree grew very tall.
I feel a lot better.
Give me a ring tomorrow.
May I visit you tomorrow?
This is my father's.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
How is your new class?
It happened very fast.
You don't need to do that.
In fact, he loves her.
My opinion differs from hers.
Will you sell your car to me?
He's a journalist.
You are so stupid.
I think you look fine.
I just can't wait.
The jets took off one after another.
The person we're trying to catch is very dangerous.
Tom said he doesn't know anyone in Boston.
She burst into tears when she heard the news.
I wish I could go back in time.
You know people.

When will your new novel come out?
You've got to move.
She called him bad names.
He took part in the anti-war demonstration.
Don't do anything until I come.
The blue lines on the map represent rivers.
I really wish you hadn't done that.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
That work was done very quickly.
It might not be enough.
Are you doing anything tomorrow night?
That's how I do everything.
I was so disappointed.
I have no time to read books.
Your daughter overheard us talking.
I'm not married anymore.
If I were you, I would ignore it.
I was just going to work.
Tom woke up at the crack of dawn.
I'd like to take a short break.
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I thought we could eat out on the patio.
It's not quite as simple as that.
Never tell anyone.
You said there was an emergency.
Look at those black clouds.
The company presented him with a gold watch on the day he retired.
Do you know what day it is today?
I just assumed you'd be here.
I'd like you to do your best.
I thought of you immediately.
I appreciate the help.
I bought a pair of boots.
The only thing that matters is that you are safe.
He wants something more.
I never realized how awful living all alone could be.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
He and I are teachers.
Have you received an answer to your letter?
I only saw him once.
Are you on your way home?
She showed up early for practice.
I don't think any of us are happy about what happened.
Music is a gift from God.
I just arrived yesterday.
You look tired.
That book costs 3,000 yen.
How's your wife doing?
We were really excited.
You don't work here.
She never reads.
The more we learn, the better we realize our ignorance.
Tom threw something at me and I ducked.
I was too afraid to do anything.
I can't believe you're getting married.
I'm about the same age as you.
When must I turn in the report?
It was three days ago.
They moved here three years ago.
Maybe I can show you.
Do you know him?
Are you sure you're not tired?
He seems happy.
We spent all of that night, the next day, and the next night in the cellar.
I don't care for foreign food.
The queen visited the museum.
I like it more and more.
Could you please do that for me?
There's a convenience store diagonally across the street.
You work here, don't you?
I thought you'd be happy.
Familiarity breeds contempt and children.
Are you doing something special on your birthday?
Did I say something funny?
He was fed up with life in the city.
He will look after the cats for me while I'm abroad.
It was a mess.
Let go of my arm.
I keep a dog.
You will have to apologize when you see him.
Is your name on the list?
He threw the letter into the fire.
Do you mind if I open the door?
Where's your sister?
The park is open to everybody.
I hope everything works out.
I guess I'm going to have to learn French.
I prefer to go alone.
I'm tired of everything.

This is a good dictionary for high school students.
She advised him not to drive too fast, but he wouldn't listen to her.

That's the problem we have to solve.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
He is said to be rich.
What's happened to us?
Tom took credit for my idea.
I dreamed I had been abducted by aliens.
A number of passengers were injured.
Tom did it single-handedly.
Taking care of the baby is my job.
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
I'm jealous.
He got caught.
Is this typewriter yours?
I chickened out.
You're obnoxious.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
I know you want to make me happy.
This is the American Embassy.
The problem is not what he said, but how he said it.
Tell me the reason why you want to live in the countryside.
Even though she was busy, she came to see me.
Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking.
You gotta get more organized.
Why do you put up with that?
Let's try doing this again.
I met an old woman.
Night is when most people go to bed.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
We can't just cut people's salaries without giving them some warning.
Are you still not convinced?
If you go by bus, you can get there in about one-third of the time.
Have a nice holiday.
Everyone was invited, except for me.
You don't have to be so rude.
I had hoped you might say that.
Everyone was shocked.
She's not old enough to get a driver's license.
No one will speak for you.
For here, or to go?
Do your homework before you watch TV.
I have a mind to buy a new car.
How many sandwiches are there left?
It's not easy.
What you said is absolute nonsense.
I won!
I will continue.
That was easier than I thought.
I learned a lot from you.
Tom knows the man Mary came with.
My car is parked not far from here.
The children are creating a painting.
He may not be able to come.
I bet you're feeling really good right now.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
Please leave a message.
You will soon get to like him.
Is it Tuesday already?
I think it's time for me to call it quits.
My motorcycle broke down on the way.
I don't like you at all.
I don't know my neighbors.
"Do you like sports?" "Yes, I like baseball, among other things."
Have you ever been lonely?
I'll buy that.
He keeps on asking me for money.
I lost my keys.
Choose your next words carefully.
He came back two days later.
He devoted a lot of time to study.
Where can I get a ticket?
I really want you to quit.
I don't want any more.
He bore a grudge against me.
Birds fly.
It's important that you understand.
Men talk about women all the time.
I don't see the connection.
I've heard enough.
I got my son to repair the door.
I will get you a bike for your birthday.
She was now out of danger.
Tom is at home with his wife.
She is helping him.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
He can't do that.
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
I can't help laughing at him.
I don't like this camera.
He lives near here.
Do you want to be left out?
Without further ado, let me introduce tonight's guest.
My friends are all married.
Have a drink.
How do you know they're looking for us?
Call the police!
Tom poured more wine into his glass.
I was a teacher.
You're always saying that.
Tom loves you all.
I shouldn't have to do all this work by myself.
I can't put up with him.
My girlfriend is crying.
I'm not the kind of person that you think I am.
I know it very well.
I plead guilty.
I ran to school, but the bell had already rung.
Where is the dog?
Shall I prepare you a warm meal?
Who else knows I'm here?
Why does everything happen to me?
You sure are pretty.
I thought Tom would be at the bar.
Some flowers bloom in the spring and other flowers bloom in the fall.
She put the children to bed.
Do you think in German?
Am I fat?
They obeyed.
I didn't go to the market.
Christmas is coming soon.
I thought you might like some hot coffee.
That's a good story. The only problem is that it's not true.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
That might be possible.
Why not try some of that white wine?
It's not why I'm here.
The man you met at the station is my father.
How cold is it in Boston right now?
My business is prospering.
These are my suitcases.
The tree fell down.
I hated you at first.
It's so simple that even a child can do it.
I will come.
This is highly illegal.
He has a tight schedule.
I slept only three hours.
We miss you.
You'll be the first to know.
I want you to go see the nurse.
That sounds a little dangerous.
He is studying in the library now.
I prefer riding to walking.
It's your only shot.
I'd like to thank you all for coming.
He is the image of his father.
I come here every day.
Can you explain what PKO stands for?
Are you here to help us?
You may have that opportunity.
I will do anything that you ask.
The old man died from hunger.
I didn't hear you come in.
You're creative.
I really like your paintings.
Five minutes' walk brought us to the park.
I think we're related.
We can save you some time.
I don't think anyone noticed what we did.
You don't have to answer.
Stop hitting your brother.
I've never seen anything like that.
I'm in way over my head.
He can't know the truth.
I know your roommate.
You're the one I've been waiting for.
This could take a while.
Find a job.
Lightning struck the tower.
Tom and Mary adopted John.
What you need is a friend.
I promise.
I get arrested from time to time.
He wears a bow tie every day.
He is a thief.
Tom would do anything to get Mary's attention.
Look at it closely.
She accompanied him on the piano.
A light rain was falling.
Get off the train immediately.
Tom says he doesn't know much about Boston.
Please wait until I come back.
Did you hear that sound?
All of a sudden, Tom and I were alone.
I don't know what to believe.
Prices will continue to go up.
Do they learn English?
I thought it must be something like that.
He kept quite calm.
You're awesome.
I am not certain about that.
They want you dead.
I can hear you loud and clear.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
He's very open.
Hurry up, girls.
Keep on smiling.
Is it safe?
Don't take this personally.
She appears to have many friends.
You're probably thirsty.
I made up my mind to go there.
I'm not a criminal.
You did your best.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
I informed him of her arrival.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
What time are you coming?
Many mistakes could have been avoided through simple experiments.
Why didn't Tom tell us what to do?
I don't think I can do that.
I've never seen a whale that big.
Zero comes before one.
I am allowed to swim in the river.
One police officer suffered minor injuries.
Let me give you an example.
It's really awesome.
I played football.
Where does all this come from?
It was five years ago that I graduated from college.
I'll put some salt on the meat.
I'm just a little dizzy.
I don't know what I was expecting.
I learned nothing from the teacher.
The news finally reached me last night.
I don't have a weapon.
You can drive a car, can't you?
I had a job when I was your age.
I'm a new student.
She works for a hospital.
I admire your determination.
I knew we'd find you.
I knew that would interest you.
She advised him to save money.
Few people live on the island.
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
They can't hurt me.
I'd like to go home now.
Are you satisfied with my explanation?
I like your necklace.
I asked where she lived.
Enjoy your stay.
She is extremely attractive.
Who would look after my children if I died?
He has learned to be patient.
My dad gave up alcohol.
In those days, few people went to college.
I never expected that she would join us.
He is actually not the manager.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
Almost no one believed him.
The ground was cold.
War's not pretty.
That's hardly likely.
Did I just say that?
He has a good chance of getting elected.
She is afraid of barking dogs.
I had a hunch you would do that.
I had loads of fun.
Do you speak Latin?
I'm making tea.
When did you get married?
I was able to swim across the river.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
I was lonely.
I demand that he be punished.
That's exactly what I meant.
Did you take it?
I have to do my hair.
Sorry, I was busy.
Tom called to say that he'll be late.
I heard someone shouting.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
He's the king's most trusted advisor.
Tom couldn't forget Mary even if he wanted to.
Keep it in mind for the next time.
Does someone here know how to do this?
He explained in detail what he had seen.
I have to take the test again.
What do they want to talk about?
This dictionary has 12 volumes.
I'm at your service.
I succeeded thanks to his advice.
I've been trying to lose a little weight.
I am in charge of the third-year class.
The Colombian government demanded more money.
I think it'd be great if you could come.
He is my brother, not father.
Not even one taxi stopped.
It's good for us to eat vegetables every day.
I wanted to go to China.
He rested his hand on my shoulder.
I tried to solve the problem, but I couldn't.
I think I'm going to be sick.
He parked his car behind the building.
Who is your favorite author?
They're all against me.
Did you read it all?
I called home.
Do what you have to do.
I would like to talk to him face to face.
Love will survive.
Who do you think you're talking to here?
Please have someone else do it.
I think it's time for me to buy a decent car.
Don't spoil your child.
Don't act surprised.
Do you have a bottle opener I could use?
She has to stop smoking.
Do you have a crush on my brother?
If you're not out of the shower in five minutes, I'm cutting the hot water!
Do you need to drink wine?
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
I found it while I was cleaning up.
That's very good advice.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
I always get nervous in her presence.
I think you should check under the bed.
He was elected mayor again.
That's not how I want things to be.
She watched him dance.
I have something you want.
Are you here alone?
Tom wants me to go with him.
Is that what you think I want to hear?
This is an effective remedy for crime.
You'd better see a dentist at once.
Tom slept on an inflatable mattress.
Your socks don't match.
Have you ever studied archaeology?
This is perfectly legal.
I had a fantastic time.
I make it a rule to study math every day.
If only I'd been a little taller!
I want to know who sent you.
You won't believe it.
I feel really bad about this.
I promised not to tell.
The store can supply us with anything we need.
She's a single mother of two.
I'm glad I was able to do this.
We climbed up the mountain, but with difficulty.
She showed me which dress to wear.
English has borrowed numerous words from French.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear and she nodded.
You're arrogant.
I thought you wanted this back.
Tom made a list of songs he doesn't like.
I'm celebrating.
I'm fed up with homework.
I had to stop.
We should study.
Why don't you go on a diet?
That's all.
I'm sorry, we're completely sold out.
I needed the money.
All of her songs became hits.
Why would I be mad?
Tom lied to you, didn't he?
I just can't help you right now.
My grandfather's photograph is on the wall.
Women talk nonstop.
Tom shouldn't say things like that to Mary.
It's too difficult for me.
There is no urgency.
Children like climbing trees.
He gave in to the temptation.
I'm short of breath.
We look after him.
I write in my diary every day.
Tom wasn't stupid enough to tell Mary what he really thought.
I want this luggage carried to my room at once.
Let's do it!
I want to leave Paris.
She urged him to consider the request.
They don't have to know.
I believe all that.
It's a great night to go dancing.
I am in your debt.
I hate when this happens.
There is always the risk of losing all the data on your hard disk.
Stop pulling my hair!
By the way, how many kids are going?
I would like to have this car repaired as soon as possible.
I think you ought to rest a while.
My boat is small.
Everything has been arranged.
They tried to cheer me up.
I thought you weren't coming.
They went to the zoo.
I haven't gotten any letters from Tom yet.
She did her best to help him.
I bought a watch.
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one.
I want to go back to doing what I was doing before you interrupted me.
I wish I wasn't such an idiot.
The movie was interesting.
She's missed the boat.
1980 was the year that I was born.
Can I be excused?
I'm reading things like famous novels which have been rewritten in simplified French.
Don't walk so quickly. I can't keep up.
I am Italian.
I never said I didn't want you.
They were stuck in the elevator for four hours.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Did you go out?
I had a really great time tonight.
I wonder if that was the point.
I kind of like this place.
You're very curious.
Wires transmit electricity.
I must buy one.
I really have missed you.
It was a great trip.
I'm not worried about money.
I assume we're doing a pretty good job since no one has complained.
Let in some fresh air.
When you can't do what you want, you do what you can.
What do you want me to do with these?
A lot of people do this.
I don't even want you there.
I didn't sign up for this.
I think Tom liked it.
Don't make fun of children.
We're not fussy.
You think you're funny?
We heard something moving in the next room.
I see no alternative.
You're overreacting.
She is being blackmailed by him.
That's all I wanted to know.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
I played video games after I finished my homework.
She was pleased with the new dress.
You are mistaken about that.
I became a director.
He had friends all over the world.
I don't think I can wait any longer.
I want you to be with me.
I wonder what all of them have in common.
We should be better than this.
I want to talk to you about this report.
You can't prove a thing.
Do you take me for a fool?
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
She's inquisitive by nature.
Just take my word for it.
Don't try to talk right now.
I'm old enough.
My father has been doing this job for twenty years.
I stayed home to rest.
Quit acting like a child.
She is very afraid of the dark.
We're not afraid of any difficulties.
The day was exhausting.
The man leapt to his death.
Did you forget to do your homework?
I don't blame you.
Everyone praises the boy.
I'll be very careful.
You're welcome.
I'm kind of sick today.
Do you think I'm crazy?
I don't want to fail my exams.
Do you need a ride home later?
Click here to create an account.
I wonder where Tom is.
I'm an orphan.
She wanted to return home, but she got lost.
This work is difficult for us.
What a beautiful sunset.
The contestants are gearing up for the final round of competition.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
Just water, please.
I looked at the calendar on the wall.
What is this place?
The cost of living in Japan is going down.
You will find this in a hardware store.
Tom introduced Mary to his family.
I had no intention of going there by myself.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
They greeted each other warmly.
We are decorating the conference room.
Tom is taller than his mother.
Something must be done immediately to deal with this problem.
His mother was ashamed of him.
You'd better go home.
Everyone is here now.
I took this picture a week ago.
It was a good answer.
Tom shot at Mary with a crossbow.
He dwells in the country.
You touched my heart.
Some words are hard to define.
That's his specialty.
Why aren't you taking notes?
When you're mad, count to ten before speaking.
He said, "I want to be a scientist."
I never imagined I'd be working for you.
Some birds are sitting on the branch of that tree.
I'm really happy.
By the time you land at Narita, it will be dark.
Elephants are the world’s largest land animals.
Just trust me.
I'm not a millionaire.
I have to deliver this package to Tom Jackson.
Beware of pickpockets.
I wasn't scared at all.
Why is Tom still here?
She is a beauty.
We ate cotton candy at the state fair.
I'll be fine.
I'm only telling the truth.
No one works there anymore.
I respect you.
You should make up your own mind.
I love you the best of all.
I don't like office politics.
You're the first person I told that to.
Tom needs to leave early today.
I think we could help each other.
Hello, is the accountant there, please?
You didn't have to wake me up.
Why did they hire you?
I'm only going to show you once.
The sun shines during the day.
He thought of a good idea.
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.
So how did the date go?
The government collapsed after a vote in parliament.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
I still don't know.
Spain will need to borrow 100 billion euros.
Tom sings off key.
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
This is sweet.
Do you know what to do if there's a fire in the building?
You're aggressive.
I have to choose my words very carefully.
I wanted to see what would happen.
I thought that he was honest.
This dictionary has about 40,000 entries.
Keep your hands up.
I've got a little problem.
I can do it.
You can't do this to me.
Tom shouldn't spend so much.
I know what to watch for.
Where were you stationed?
What do you like to do?
Don't be foolish.
She didn't even try to do the right thing.
I forgot to pay for the drinks.
Have you made up your mind to become a teacher?
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
He pretended not to know me.
Can I buy only the lenses?
This is a popular artist.
I know what you want to talk about.
We were mistaken.
No pain, no gain.
We were late because of the storm.
We left the door open.
The two families live under one roof.
How can you be so sure?
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
It's shameful to treat a child so cruelly.
My father goes to Sydney twice a year on business.
Tom wished he could understand French better.
That's the answer.
There are various kinds of candy in that bowl.
My neighbor renovated his house completely.
Tom is the spitting image of his father.
I'm aware of my responsibilities.
She will not stick to her word.
We play games together.
I cut myself.
He's racking his brains about how to deal with the matter.
Did you finish your paper?
I thought you'd wear something like that.
The police kept looking for a stolen article for about one month.
Having finished it, he went to bed.
I can't go to work today.
It's just a game.
What do you need me to do?
I'm sure Tom will know how to do it.
You are too sensitive to criticism.
My family will be away for a week.
Tom didn't want to come here, but he came anyway.
You won't believe your eyes.
He is popular with his men.
Your answer differs from mine.
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day.
I think we've met before.
Under no circumstances can we accept checks.
Tom knows a shortcut.
Is it yours?
Do you feel lucky?
I didn't rescue anybody.
He returned to America.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
May I use your dictionary?
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
He likes to talk about himself.
She made him a new suit.
There isn't much furniture in my room.
That's a very good sign.
Don't you have work to do?
I was caught in the rain and got wet.
Did you bring a weapon?
She dressed up for the party.
Please sit still.
I've had a very busy morning.
Take whichever of these you want.
We know so little about Tom.
I don't want to run such a risk.
A fuse has blown.
She was the first one to notice him.
I'll cancel.
He understands her problems more or less.
He took up gardening after he retired.
I got up very early this morning.
Accidents happen all the time.
I'll let you know.
Can we cut to the chase here?
He gave me a smile of recognition.
You can't do this to me.
She was holding an umbrella.
I know how busy you are.
He failed in business, and to make matters worse, his wife fell ill.
Sugar is sweet.
His house is near the subway station.
I can't eat all this.
That always helps.
You may go at once.
The Milky Way consists of about a hundred billion stars.
Did you have fun?
Who are you to judge?
Do you have any messages for me?
I became rich.
Tom just got married.
Don't drink the water.
He's a cold-hearted jerk.
I should have told someone.
He could die.
I have to warn him.
How did you find us?
That's what you all say.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
You're very generous.
I just got your letter yesterday.
Tell me. I'm all ears.
I don't watch TV very much.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
This is my father's room.
Treat her well.
The elevator seems to be out of order.
You have changed since I saw you last year.
I didn't notice it.
That shouldn't be hard for you.
Tom and Mary are planning a picnic at the lake.
It rained nonstop.
Whose fault is it?
I really want to speak English fluently.
She advised him to go to the police station.
You're very understanding.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
I don't have any money.
She is making dinner.
He is unpopular for some reason.
The students seem to be sleepy today.
Let's do it!
Why don't we duck back inside?
This is a miracle.
The door is locked.
Just give me what I want.
Whether you like it or not doesn't matter.
Will you give me a ride to my hotel?
Are you ready now?
Ten years have passed since he died.
How would you describe me?
She made me a nice dress.
She told me that she loved me.
Your phone is ringing again.
Few students know how to read Latin.
It's an incredible sight.
She is not a poet but a novelist.
What he said yesterday is not consistent with what he had said last week.
Currently, he's our best batter.
What do you like about her?
Kissing a smoker is like licking an ashtray.
I thought Tom would say that.
Does it work?
He has a short attention span.
Let's start with the basics.
You're creative.
He's kind of cute.
You two had a fight today, didn't you?
Learn these names by heart.
Tom lived in Boston until a few years ago.
How old is that painting?
Where were all of you?
You're all hypocritical.
Slip on your shoes.
I know very little about him.
I motivated you.
Where did you go to college?
The long discussion came to an end at last.
It's impossible to change it now.
Why don't we drive out to the country for a change of pace?
The earth is much larger than the moon.
When did you get married?
This mission entails huge risks.
I did not see the sign.
The child picked up a small stone.
I love romance novels.
You're taking advantage of her weakness.
You're forgiven.
I talk to myself.
That one is all yours.
My husband is a very good cook.
Do you have an opinion?
I need to get a stamp.
It's been a long time since I've done anything like that.
My favorite color is blue.
This guy's great at pitching curveballs.
He wants to work in a hospital.
This laptop is light.
She doesn't understand you.
Ask her what she bought.
I wish I had a camera.
Have you eaten?
Would you like another glass of wine?
Is somebody there?
I'm not lonely.
I love being a teacher.
I'll have it done before 2:30.
I cannot eat anything today.
She treated him like a king.
Girls are crazy.
I got on the wrong train.
She bought me a nice coat.
Take off your clothes.
You're powerless.
A cat appeared from under the desk.
I live in a rural area.
She sent me a postcard that said she hates the smell of animals.
Does anyone have any questions thus far?
He hates air travel.
She tied him up.
I'm going to the supermarket to do some shopping.
She stood close to him.
Can you tell me what this is?
I'd like to help, but I've got an important meeting to attend.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Let me see it.
I didn't spend anything.
What were you two doing there anyway?
A man came in and sat on the stool next to her.
My mother is making my father a cake.
Open the door, please.
I owe you my life.
What's the name of your dog?
Bring it back when you're done.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
It gets worse.
I read a lot of novels.
They talked on the telephone every night.
Tell me why I shouldn't fire you.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
Have you gone nuts?
Watch us.
He found it impossible to go there on foot.
He had his share of luck.
I understand perfectly.
Please tell him to wait.
This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me!
I can see the light.
Every bus is full.
We're totally cool with that.
You're the best.
They worked each day from the time the sun rose until it set.
Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died.
I thought Tom had a soccer game tonight.
All the flowers in the garden died for lack of water.
I never believed it.
What is it with you, anyway?
There are many kinds of coffee.
I traveled around Europe.
Don't stay out all night.
He has a nimble mind.
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
Tom was fatter three years ago than he is now.
That's not yours.
Do you have a tattoo?
I get along with everyone.
They all understood your speech.
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.
Help me, please.
Tom writes very well.
Step forward and make room for others.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
I grew up in a poor family.
She looked at a few dresses and picked the most expensive one.
A good many people have told me to take a holiday.
Tom is a football player.
My phone doesn't work.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
That sounds interesting.
Tom owes us a favor.
I've always wanted to meet you.
It wasn't much of a party.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
The dog should be on a chain.
How dare you speak like that?
You don't know them.
When I opened the door, I found him asleep.
We will defeat them.
I didn't go to school because I was sick.
There are several ways to measure speed.
It's about time you got a haircut.
He told me his life's story.
I know you're just trying to help, and I appreciate that.
What did you drink?
Your birthday is drawing near.
You may use my pen at any time.
I refuse to answer.
My strength is all gone.
When he came to, he was tied to a chair in the basement.
How about taking up jogging?
I'd have waited for you.
I wish we could ask Tom that question.
I caught sight of her in the crowd.
You're not dead.
Come back in an hour.
How lucky you are!
She advised him to take the money.
Almost all the leaves have fallen.
It makes little difference.
Foxes have few natural predators.
I've made up my mind to learn how to play the harp.
I will have finished the work before you return.
How can you justify your behavior?
I'm a bit hungry.
You're wanted by the police.
What a beautiful rainbow!
I'm loved by my parents.
Why is she looking at me?
This tea is too hot to drink.
I know a guy who has never seen snow.
The house is in need of repair.
He is not guilty of murder.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
He shook hands with me.
We finally have you where we want you.
We're ready now.
I never really gave it much thought.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
You are a good person.
He gave a deep sigh.
Tom thought Mary was probably about thirty.
Would you like to have another beer?
That really isn't what I meant.
I love the songs sung by Kylie Minogue.
When I heard that, I started to cry.
You can pick out any book you like.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
I caught him by the arm before he could fall.
I can't accept this theory.
Yesterday I was ill.
They are all very happy.
She advised him to go there.
That's evident.
Who invited you here?
What a loser!
I often go fishing in that river.
The wind is blowing from the west.
He drives me crazy.
Tom has never danced with Mary.
You are not a child any more.
People have eaten with their fingers from the beginning of history.
I don't know how to drive.
I have lived here since 1990.
My parents were proud of me.
I know someone needs to tell Tom about Mary's death. Does it have to be me?
We're going to eat right now.
Do you travel much?
Would you like a drink?
Call me at this number.
He is a born artist.
Prices are about to go up again.
Oats have long been food for horses and mules.
Tom and his friends sat around the campfire and roasted marshmallows.
Japan and South Korea are neighbors.
My wife is always finding fault with me.
The poor old man became so thin that now he's just skin and bones.
He was deaf, too.
She heard him cry in the middle of the night.
We must cut down our expenses.
I don't feel like a man anymore.
You didn't scare me off.
After a couple of drinks, the guy was feeling no pain.
Do you know of an apartment I can rent that allows pets?
He was accused of stealing money.
One more person will be joining us later.
Tom has lots of money.
My mother cooks for me.
I really like China.
May I interrupt you?
We were always together.
She urged him to consider the request.
I thought you of all people would understand my decision.
The Japanese embassy has warned Japanese citizens to be careful.
I think you need to buy a new pair of hiking boots.
Is that really important?
I need to find a better job on the double to pay my bills.
Why do you always do that to me?
You'll get used to it.
Can you take the lid off this box?
What do you think happens then?
You can smoke in this room.
Someone might get hurt.
I want to be worthy of your friendship.
I'd like to give you the key, but I can't.
I got slapped on both cheeks.
I weigh about 60 kilos.
I could barely contain my excitement.
She woke him up.
He lives just around the corner.
There's something I feel you should know.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
Have you read the article about Asia in Time?
This is the culmination of years of work.
People thought that she was dead.
Tom's situation was different.
I felt bad, so I was admitted into the hospital. However, it turned out that there was nothing really wrong with me.
Are you productive?
I think they like you.
They parted with a firm handshake.
Tom has a horse.
I should've done that, but I didn't.
Living in a cluttered home is very stressful.
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
Don't come near me. I have a cold.
She spends a lot of money on shoes.
You can go to the station by bus.
I never thought it'd be this easy to hack into your website.
Let's leave it up to him.
Dry wood burns quickly.
It looks like an apple.
Tom doesn't take criticism well.
If you're not happy, quit.
You're very rude.
I suggest we hurry.
What is it that you want me to do?
What was her answer to your proposal?
Make a list.
Let's get together the next time you come back to Boston.
Are you with us, Tom?
Did you have fun last night?
She couldn't convince him to give a speech.
I'll say no more.
The data cited in King's research is taken from UNESCO's 1970 white paper on world population.
Did I do something stupid?
It's wrong.
He isn't who he says he is.
I ate too much.
She decided not to go.
I didn't break it.
You can tell me anything.
I like wearing old clothes.
You don't have a lot to say, do you?
This is refreshing.
We can't help you.
Please tell me what happened.
He is now staying in Paris.
He is experienced in valuing antiques.
I called earlier.
Take a cookie.
You don't talk to me that way.
Let's pretend this never happened.
When was the potato introduced in Japan?
Please hold the line a moment.
Clearly, that wasn't the case.
It's for you.
You don't have to explain.
He is planning to launch his business.
They were free at that moment.
This is a waterproof watch.
Tom was impatient and restless.
I couldn't put up with that noise any longer.
Don't kill me.
You have something of mine.
They look bored.
Wasn't it supposed to snow last night?
I ate absolutely nothing the whole day.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Shut the door tight.
I've got to get away for a while.
When is it going to happen?
You're not interrupting anything.
I've decided to go a little further.
Why don't you talk to us now?
I agree with you.
What sort of things do you do on weekends?
You need not go there.
You must be cautious.
How long may I keep this?
The basket was full of apples.
Are you almost here?
What's your best price?
Are you up for it?
That's just what we need.
Come on, Tom. Let's go home.
This is his house.
What were you two doing there anyway?
Just trust me.
We're only friends.
I wish I had studied harder for the test.
I'm still concerned.
What are you waiting for?
You're kind of cute when you're mad.
We met last Thursday.
We're classmates.
Tom never said a word to me.
They make a great team.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee.
You can't have left it at the airport.
He's not in.
Run for it!
I could use a little sleep.
Don't you have an air conditioner?
A true gentleman never betrays his friends.
I majored in philosophy at my university.
Did you go out?
She advised him to see a lawyer.
Are you bald?
I received my bonus.
They rented the upstairs room to a student.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
He failed to escape from the fire and burned to death.
Tom handed Mary a knife so she could peel the apples.
Where's your family, Tom?
So what's your problem?
Why are you so insecure?
I'm so happy, I feel like I could fly.
She lived a lonely life.
The fact that I'm here proves that I'm innocent.
We're satisfied.
I don't get nervous.
That's absolute nonsense!
It looks like she has a lot of friends.
This makes me curious.
What was the outcome?
I want to see you smile.
I'm not available.
Do you take American Express?
She was out when I called.
She advised me where to stay.
The train lurched to a standstill.
Please let go of my arm.
I want to make you happy.
Scientists have found water on Mars.
Tom left.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
Well begun is half done.
Education doesn't consist of learning a lot of facts.
I thought you did fairly well.
They struggled.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
We're closing early.
Is everybody ready?
Do you believe in the power of love?
I think about you all the time.
He did his best to rescue her.
This rug was made without the use of child labor.
I love being alone.
I made a complete fool of myself.
We are about to sit down to dinner.
I always think of him when I'm alone.
I don't know who you're talking about.
I'm adventurous.
I had to do my duty.
I don't know what's going on around here, but I intend to find out.
He used to live here.
I pulled an all-nighter preparing for the exam.
How's your old lady doing?
I appreciate that.
I know better than to be believe such a rumor.
I had a great time here.
This won't happen again.
Your hair is too long.
It is our duty to obey the law.
I can't stand violence.
You might want to try working out a bit.
She is really into knitting.
He has ants in his pants.
I found it difficult to read the book.
I know someone was here.
My grandma injured her leg in a fall.
What really surprised me most was that I was the only one who got fired.
You can't know that for sure.
I could hear everything.
Tom did twenty pushups.
I don't appreciate your attitude.
Do you really want to know?
Please stop whistling.
He betrayed you.
To tell the truth, I drove my father's car without his permission.
It's too bright.
You may pay in advance for your order.
I'm intrigued.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
What did you make?
We'd better get a move on or we'll be late.
She assumed an air of indifference.
It's really stressful.
We worry about your future.
Are you feeling under the weather?
Who's replacing you?
You could pass for a teenager if you wore a T-shirt.
Tom writes better than I do.
We prepared snacks beforehand.
I'm very sorry.
Some snakes are poisonous.
They swam.
I like good coffee.
It cannot be done.
Do not sign a delivery receipt unless it accurately lists the goods received.
They mistook my politeness for friendship.
Who knows what you'll find up in the attic?
I could hear everything the president said.
I helped you when you needed help.
Do you have a crowbar in your toolbox?
I'm painting an Easter egg.
That's how the pros do it.
They followed you here.
I've warned you before about this.
I was able to get my parents to consent to my marriage.
Tom seems more annoyed than angry.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
It's no use pretending that you can't speak French.
Everyone wants something.
That's a cheap store.
Her silence surprised me.
It's your duty to finish the job.
I like your car.
I corrected it.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
It's nice to be back home.
Say it in French.
The job of a driver is harder than it looks.
We searched everywhere.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
When was the last time you hunted?
What do I mean to you?
Put the coat on the hanger.
The murderer was executed.
He made a robot.
You're a prude.
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday.
She suggested that I write to him at once.
I can teach you how to do this.
I want to cut down on the time it takes to process records.
We were in Boston.
The restaurant is empty.
She was brought up by her grandmother.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
We know our problems.
The principal shook hands with each of the graduates.
I hate my life.
I can't thank you enough.
I wanna go to Japan.
You must always keep your hands clean.
I thought you were against this proposal.
Let me handle it.
I wasn't able to believe him at first.
She didn't give me her name.
I got up earlier than usual.
Tom described the problem in detail.
Do you speak French?
Tom didn't feel tired.
You came too late.
Glass is made from sand.
He said, "Let's take a walk along the river."
Of the two girls, she is the younger.
I sat next to Tom.
English is spoken in many parts of the world.
After his accident, he is happy to be alive.
I would rather stay at home than go out in the rain.
He has a reputation as being straight as an arrow. He'd never get involved in corruption.
Let me handle it.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
Why should anyone be surprised?
That's exactly what I expect.
I finished my lunch quickly.
I must buy a new winter coat.
There is a TV remote control under the couch.
Where is the ticket office?
You're not supposed to be here.
I don't speak your language.
Nobody came.
He's not young anymore.
He went for the doctor.
What should I do?
It's on the sofa.
He played a key role in the movement.
At last, her dream to be a doctor came true.
What would you like me to do with this?
The shortage of manpower poses a big problem for us.
You can't come with us.
Tom is from Australia.
I'd like to look like Tom.
I feel a little insecure.
He seemed to be ill.
Don't you see what you're doing?
Please allow me to ask you a few questions.
You read too much.
I just found out that my boyfriend has been stepping out on me.
There is a message for you.
Their sales are growing.
Don't mention this to anyone.
You're not married, are you?
All human beings are mortal.
I thought it was about time we all met.
I hate this.
Have you ever seen a film this good?
I called him up.
Can I speak to you in private?
He advertised his house for sale.
It was impossible for me to answer this question.
I put my fingers in my ears to block out the terrible sounds.
If you only had one more week to live, what would you spend your time doing?
Tom is a Muslim.
This is kind of expensive.
She would often play tricks on me.
I didn't think you were home.
I'm beginning to see what you mean.
Ask him whether she is at home or not.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
Come over to our table.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
You're very sophisticated.
I beg your pardon.
Why don't you come to the movies with me?
I have a loving family.
You're disgusting.
I hate this carpet.
Don't drink that.
Either they don't want to or they can't.
I can't believe I'm going to lose my job.
I had a really great time with your family.
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
She stabbed him.
He wiped his nose on his sleeve.
This seems kind of expensive.
Nobody should've died.
Are you finished?
What is your name, sir?
Please write down your name.
I can't explain it to you now.
We've all done things we're ashamed of.
I'll just have one or two beers.
I'm thinking of embarking on a new career.
You're quiet.
Promise me you won't do that again.
I know that this is the first time this has happened to you.
Take this medicine after meals.
A general election will be held in May.
It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Don't let it get to you.
Do you take me for a fool?
This plan had little chance of success.
Accidents will happen.
Luckily nobody got wet.
I'm going to put it in my room.
You don't know what you're talking about.
His hobby is painting pictures.
Why couldn't you come yesterday?
The accent of this word is on the second syllable.
I asked him if he knew my name.
How many colors are there?
You're not fooling anybody.
I strongly urge you to follow my advice.
You're really gorgeous.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
You two may leave.
I just want to be clear.
I'm going to miss you.
She said that she had been happy.
I'd like you to wear this.
You really don't have a clue, do you?
I got lost in the forest.
I just changed my password.
It is so early.
She didn't show up.
Tom moved here three months ago.
He played tennis all day long.
Do you like mine?
We kept together for safety.
My wife is cooking.
Come whenever you want.
I want you to find out.
She was fully clothed.
Maybe we should pray.
I ran like the wind.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Sixty-nine percent of adult Americans are overweight.
Tom despises Mary.
She plays the piano very well.
He is kind.
I feel happy when I'm with you.
Won't you have some tea?
We didn't give them a choice.
Can you hear anything?
Since there were no taxis, I had to walk.
He is well off now.
I will accept the work, provided you help me.
I was happy to hear the news.
We found Tom's umbrella.
I think you should leave Tom alone.
Tom and I usually talked to each other in French.
They sat in the shade of that big tree.
I could use a little sympathy.
The soup is thick.
I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it.
This is longer than any other bridge in the world.
I go to school by bicycle.
The reverse seems true.
There's something going on here.
I married off my daughter.
All you have to do is study harder.
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
The problem isn't that.
It looks like Tom is really enjoying himself.
Your mother is worried sick about you.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
I was wrong about that.
He is one of my old friends.
I am terribly afraid of snakes.
The guy who hit you is at the front door.
You should relax a bit.
We did what we were told.
Could I speak to you for a moment, Tom?
You can't compete with Tom.
It's hard to believe.
Let's clean this up.
On his shirt there was a sauce stain.
At last, we got to the lake.
Don't judge people by appearance.
Young people are usually full of energy.
Stop! You're making him cry.
I need to know.
We want to leave.
Was I really boring?
It's not an easy sport.
I have a lot of things to do today.
She told him that she was happy.
I can peel an apple.
I deserve it.
I'm stubborn.
I never get to see you anymore.
Don't worry about that now.
You're very timid.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
He's studying.
I'm watching TV.
I only have six months to live.
I no longer believe it.
Nobody heard the bell ring.
I didn't need your help.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
I'm not taking any chances.
He vowed to give up smoking.
Look at Tom's shoes.
Have you brought your ID card with you?
Our country's climate is temperate.
You understand French, right?
The water was hot.
He's a very nice boy.
I can't believe this happened.
I didn't sleep a wink.
He never fails to give her a birthday present.
You have good reason to be angry.
I like being a teacher.
Does that suit you?
I don't know what to call you.
I finished it.
I don't know how to address you.
Fill it with regular, please.
The papers didn't print this story.
Can you drive a stick shift?
Can you understand the meaning of this paragraph?
I don't want there to be any misunderstanding.
That's a relief.
I'm not running away.
Get that thing off of me.
I hope that's not what really happened.
Everybody speaks well of him.
Stop crying like a little girl.
The doctor cured her of her disease.
They might be taller than you.
People like him because he is kind.
The factory produces ammunition.
It is no use asking him again.
This has to be a mistake.
I read some books.
He has only six months to live.
How is Tom able to do that?
Be quiet and listen to me.
I'm not amused.
Why don't we all go?
I've found something I'd like to show you.
I just wanted to clarify that.
Tom poured milk into the cup.
Are you on dope?
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
It's quite likely that he'll come.
How long have you been abroad?
I feel dizzy every time I get up.
I haven't written anything for months.
I got busy.
I went swimming in the river.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
There were a lot of murders last year.
They are engaged in cancer research.
He is very friendly, so I enjoy working with him.
You'll thank me for this someday.
You're a funny gal.
A bad smell permeated the room.
This work doesn't pay.
As far as I know, this is the only translation available.
You must not go out at night.
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
Why are you sad?
His hair is so long it reaches the floor.

I'll spend the night here.
I can't stand him.
I feel like vomiting.
She looked at me and laughed.
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
Are you ready?
Have you taken your medicine yet?
You're courteous.
Sounds like you're having fun.
His girlfriend did it for him.
I have no further questions.
I am glad to accept your invitation.
I want to talk to all of them.
Come whenever you want.
I was wrong.
No one came.
I was told that it's dangerous to swim here.
This machine is worthless.
Goodbye. I'll see you at the time we agreed on.
Please give me a hamburger.
It's okay to take it easy sometimes.
It is said that he was very rich.
Of course I remember you.
They're useless.
Have you heard from him?
I have some correspondence to deal with.
You may use his library.
He wants you to come home.
He inherited an old wooden chest.
They'll tell you the truth.
You won't go, will you?
The samurai decapitated his opponent in one fell swoop.
Are you going to eat those fries?
Can you tell us what happened to you?
Excuse me, could we have some more bread?
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.
I'm glad someone agrees with me for once.
Tom couldn't contain his anger.
They had no beards, no hair and no eyebrows.
I love this car.
You look just fine.
Her hopes were dashed when she heard the verdict.
Have you considered therapy?
Tom attached the string to the kite.
Can you recommend a place to stay in London?
I'm no fool.
I have known that for a long time.
Are you thirsty?
I think you must be getting tired.
The clerk waited on them immediately.
Which team is the most likely to win the championship?
You aren't invited.
Thank you for the other day.
He heard a noise.
I think you should check under the bed.
Why don't you talk to me about it?
I've made a decision.
It was snowing when I woke up.
Study these sentences.
How can I repay you?
Where did you learn to cook like this?
Life is very short.
If I were you, I would apply for the job.
They did it again.
They've had enough.
I know you want to help.
You will always be welcome.
A strong wind severed the electric wires in several places.
I hope I can hold on to my job.
Lend me your book, please.
Artists are highly respected in France.
Never be this late again.
You should spend what little time you have left with your friends.
Beef is expensive nowadays.
I kept on reading.
She kept on talking while eating.
I looked down.
Will it be fine tomorrow?
I feel kind of sorry for Tom.
Everyone was hungry.
Time has come to get serious.
Do you want to hear my theory?
What could they possibly want us to do?
His advice didn't help much.
Can somebody open the door please?
I sure hope he passes the test.
Are you blackmailing me?
Don't dodge the question.
He never wears a tie.
Nobody knows the truth.
She was loved by everybody in the village.
You're very resourceful.
It's your turn to wash the dishes.
I won't tell if you won't.
I was injured while I was skiing.
I saw it on TV.
I can't move.
Some people never grow up.
What makes you think I'm going to go to Boston with Tom?
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
Today, I do not have time for this.
Be merciful.
Grammar is a very complex thing.
We got up at dawn.
Could you move forward so we can close the door?
All their efforts were in vain.
Why did you buy the flowers?
Tom and Mary are both professors.
Do you have any problems with that?
May I escort you home?
Your services are no longer required.
What's happening now in Poland?
We don't know why he had to leave.
Don't look at me with such sad eyes.
I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
Where do you want us to start looking?
What were her final words?
Is there a doctor in the house?
Were you excited?
Unexpected stuff happens all the time.
We weren't all that busy.
You look young for your age.
He loves animals.
I'm at the airport right now.
I didn't see their faces.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Why didn't you just leave?
All I have is books.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
Try not to be so tense.
Why not live it up?
The cat is stuck in the tree.
We can't put a young boy in prison.
This isn't at all surprising.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
That sounds very important.
It works well.
That's not all that happened.
Do you talk to your dog?
How do you plan to help me?
She has an eye for beauty.
Tom is really ambitious.
This milk has a peculiar taste.
Since there were no customers, we closed the shop early.
Tom is merciless.
Where did you get that orange scarf?
It doesn't matter how old you are.
Can you do it faster?
The heavy snowfall blocked the roads.
He whispered something to her.
Tom hasn't finished his homework yet.
I'm easygoing.
I have to practice the piano every day.
Tom asked Mary why she was so late.
Let's go downtown.
He came home very late.
My heart's aching.
Let's get a cup of coffee.
He speaks Japanese well.
I went for a walk with my son.
I find that fascinating.
I couldn't hear what was being said.
It's very rude of you to say a thing like that.
His silence surprised me.
You should call the police.
Are you going, too?
I've only had my driver's license for three months.
I don't know how to reach you.
What do you say to my plan?
We'll all be dead eventually.
I might not be at tonight's party.
He's done this before.
She isn't afraid of death.
You're starting to scare me.
I never noticed.
"I've only had two boyfriends." "Oh, I have two boyfriends right now."
I didn't pretend to be your friend.
Who buys this type of art?
You owe him the truth.
That isn't Tom's car.
We danced all night long.
She'll try it once more.
I have read every book on the shelf.
She couldn't come because he was sick.
Why didn't you dance with him?
We all have missed you.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
We're ready to put the boat in the water.
She was very happy with my gift.
The TV doesn't work.
You're worried, aren't you?
I thought perhaps you'd give up.
All you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
I used to do that as a kid.
Are you in a hurry?
We surrendered.
I guess I should be going.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
If not now, then when?
The earthquake shook the houses.
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
I can't do this myself.
She needed some money to buy something to feed her dog.
Introducing democratic ideas into that country will be a slow process.
Hi! What's new?
The owners appointed him manager.
The train came on time.
Be friendly.
I need to get some sleep.
I feel safe here.
How tall you are!
I used to keep a diary in English when I was a student.
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
The president ignored the protesters outside his office.
As far as I know, she hasn't left yet.
Do you study French every day?
Do you want to do it again?
You have bought more postage stamps than are necessary.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Are you lonely?
Five plus three is eight.
I didn't take the wrong umbrella.
Have a look.
Hurry up.
There's no knife.
She guided me to the palace.
My mother is preparing breakfast.
Wait till six.
She wasn't able to meet him.
They died one after another.
Tom is in an angry mood.
I don't want anything more.
I was thinking about what she had said to me.
You should do that soon.
Would you please not leave the door open?
We've done it all.
I'm paying.
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
How long were you gone?
Prepare yourself.
Will Tom be ready?
What are you writing?
"How are you?" "I am fine, thank you."
Will you ever tell me your age?
He doesn't like coffee.
I'm sure.
Mother and I were in the garden.
I thought a walk in the park might take our minds off our troubles.
The swimmer raised his head and gasped for breath.
Give me a second chance.
Tom ought to stop smoking.
It's starting now.
Anything is possible.
I like to help my friends.
I just heard that Tom and Mary are moving to Boston.
I can't really remember.
How about running?
What do they want us to do?
Judging from his appearance, he may be a soldier.
You understand, don't you?
Tom kissed Mary's forehead.
We lost our chance.
I feel honored.
This may hurt a bit.
Tom didn't like Mary.
I caught a glimpse of him as he turned the corner.
I decided to tell him that I love her.
I will give you whatever you want.
I didn't want you involved in this.
The secret of life is hanging around until you get used to it.
Tom fell asleep while he was driving and caused an accident.
Look closely.
These are mine.
I wonder what to make for dinner.
Some animals eat their young.
It's a wonderful work of art.
I like to play the piano.
Nobody can escape death.
Her novel sold well.
Why did you stop?
They tried a third time.
I just want you to tell Tom what you told me.
I didn't tell anybody.
I agree with what you've written.
I do remember.
A slip of the tongue often brings about unexpected results.
I never wanted to harm you.
Tom likes to knit.
I've missed out on so much.
Why don't you ride with me?
I hope you're happy.
I had to beg my friends to come to my party.
We can't go back.
Great weather, isn't it?
We all stood up at once.
We don't have a landline anymore.
Could I get one more beer, please?
What did you do exactly?
No way!
I really wasn't expecting that from you.
Can anybody else answer?
I've retired.
They'll never know.
They didn't find the bomb.
Tell me it's not true.
I've lived here my entire life.
He is not like he seems.
What can I get you?
He ran away from home.
He gave up hope.
Your lives will be spared if you surrender.
The magazines were dog-eared.
All of my friends have bicycles.
He's already left.
I had hoped that my mother would live until I got married.
She was quite nervous about her first flight.
She lives in an apartment.
She thinks about him when she's feeling lonely.
It all makes sense.
Do you know Latin?
Did everybody hear that?
The table was covered with paper.
There are some flies on the wall.
They couldn't find the problem.
Don't obey that man.
What's your wish?
I got expelled.
I was wrong.
A stranger spoke to me in the bus.
That's a really good hospital.
It was a bad movie.
The eagle had to be fed by hand.
You're beautiful.
What're we looking for?
Her father has a general store.
Tom will never know it was you who told me.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
I can't do this job without you.
He is fresh from college.
Just get out of here.
Get out of my house.
Ebola spreads from person to person through bodily fluids.
He is playing here.
I want to go there once again.
I'm being paid to do this.
The bicycle is mine.
The bridge is under construction.
I'm not sitting here.
The attempt failed.
I like science fiction better.
She's got a point.
I never want to see you again.
What kind of music do you like?
What did you say? Could you please say it again?
The basket was empty.
I always thought you'd make a cute couple.
You should pay more attention to what he says.
I was really scared.
Tom seems young.
I like your cookies.
I don't like to fail.
I have a prior engagement.
Tom is capable of anything.
You must have been surprised to meet your teacher in such a place.
You did it in front of the staff.
Can you help her out before they catch her?
You can't go yet.
He did what he had to do.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
How does this disease spread?
Is this your car?
I finally escaped.
Cats are smarter than you think.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
She didn't press him for an explanation.
I couldn't find his house.
I just want to say I love you.
He fell in love with the girl at first sight.
The truth shall set you free.
There's a math test tomorrow.
He doesn't understand you.
She went there yesterday.
I'll try that.
We need a car.
We've only got three more days.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
It brings me great joy.
Roll down your window.
They were both drunk.
What do you do on Fridays?
She advised him not to drink too much.
He shut the door.
Please be careful.
If you want a pencil, I'll lend you one.
He had no luck in finding work.
The baby cried.
She spends all her time thinking about boys.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
I don't want cereal.
You haven't even tried.
He kept talking.
It's a cautionary tale.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
I was unable to save Tom.
I'd like you to look after my dog while I'm away.
You don't want to know.
I like listening to music.
Trade helps nations develop.
You have got to be kidding me.
I'll do whatever it takes to get you back.
That happened over a year ago.
I didn't know what to say to her.
At last, they met face to face.
It's not that easy to learn a new language after fifty.
She advised him to keep his promises.
Tom is taking his final exam.
He complains of not having enough time to read.
I can't get her out of my mind.
Let's talk about this later.
The soldier returned home on a furlough.
I really can't deal with that right now.
What you need is a friend.
I had no idea this bracelet was stolen.
Non-members pay an additional 50 dollars.
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
Everybody applauded.
I'd appreciate it if you'd come with me.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I have to do a lot of things.
Should I leave?
We'll get another one.
I don't care what you do with your money.
Don't think about it too much.
He has a headache.
I'm deeply offended by this.
The boy made a paper plane.
Tell us the story from beginning to end.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Do you understand what's going on?
He asked me to open the door.
My blood type is A positive.
Does that seem strange to you?
What if the unthinkable should happen?
I'd love to come back next week.
Tom keeps hanging up on me.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
Let's speak in English.
I live across the street.
What you do is more important than what you say.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
My daughter was premature.
I don't mind.
I visited her in Germany.
I was forced to do it.
His grandmother can't walk, can she?
I won't be back for a while.
I've seen it with my own eyes.
That baby does nothing but cry.
I'm taller than you.
He finally decided to try.
What're you all dressed up for?
Water power turns the wheel.
Do you have the painting?
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Does she know your telephone number?
We must continue.
Are you questioning my judgment?
Why are you so obsessed with cars?
She never wears green.
Just who are you?
I have been living here for three years.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
He was tired so he went to bed.
You had better turn off the light before you go to sleep.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I can't believe you did all this without any help.
Don't you see who's following us?
I still have just enough time to get this done, I think.
Is someone meeting us?
They don't have a car.
I agree with most people here.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
A loud noise jolted me awake from a deep sleep.
You have made the very same mistake again.
What's the problem anyway?
I need to be prepared.
Tom reads slowly.
They know we're here.
What did you do then?
I can't do this work alone.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
What was the cause of the accident?
You look a little shaken.
We have no proof.
Can I have your phone number?
He pinched me!
Are you writing a letter?
The French language is rich in synonyms.
We used to be best friends.
They concluded that he had told a lie.
You can't deny that.
This packaging is hard to remove.
This is too important to overlook.
They go to work on foot.
I suppose you'll be needing this.
He seems not to be aware of the conflict between my father and me.
Let me help you put on your coat.
I had a dentist's appointment this morning.
Can you tell me what it means?
I think you know why I can't do that.
At last, we reached our destination.
He will survive.
They want to do this right.
I'm still the boss around here.
Do whatever it takes to get the job done.
I have no idea how many people will be at the picnic.
If I could be that guy instead of me.
Would you sing us a song in English?
We lost.
Has Tom always been fat?
I had a small dinner party last weekend.
I ran as fast as I could, but I missed the bus.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
He could always tell which direction the wind was blowing.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Can you estimate how late the train will be?
How could you not say something?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much.
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
Tom looked back.
What is it with you people?
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
I eat a lot of carrots.
Did I hear you right?
I wonder if anything happened to him.
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?
I promise you I'll never leave you.
I owe you a beer.
Tom is hiding something.
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I have not eaten any seafood since the recent oil spill.
You're overreacting.
He was conscious of his mistake.
What'll you be doing this summer?
Why don't you listen?
He puts ten dollars aside every week.
You're amazing.
They want me to organize the party.
Since she got her braces, I've hardly seen her smile.
I hope Tom is safe.
They forgot to lock the door.
Everyone got sick.
Tom is a very shy boy.
He did not listen.
All the guests were touched by her hospitality.
The contents of the letter were secret.
I haven't seen him for years.
Possible side effects include blurred vision and shortness of breath.
How's your father?
I'm sick of English.
I don't understand what you are saying.
I'm sure he mistook me for my sister.
I saw fear in his eyes.
We must fix this.
That house is haunted.
The section chief seems to like abusing his authority.
Tom changed his diet.
It was very scary.
I'm really not busy.
He was not at all satisfied.
Are you looking for a job?
Were you at the library yesterday afternoon?
You're very generous.
You don't know how much I love you.
I sprained my finger while playing volleyball.
The meeting was just about over.
I'm writing a book.
Everyone started arguing.
He repeated his question.
I can't depend on you anymore.
You did it in front of the staff.
Tom pretended that he didn't see it.
No matter how rich he may be, he is never contented.
It's not like that.
This looks like a gunshot wound.
I need to know your answer by Friday.
You must keep your promises.
You're the most important person in my life.
Are you volunteering to help?
I was on vacation.
He's head over heels in love.
He's doing his best.
The old system works.
I never have had occasion to use it.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
Do you have a pencil?
He was found lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
It was yesterday that he went there.
Tell Tom what you mean.
May I eat this apple?
He sleeps during the day and works at night.
Tom said that he was going to be late.
We may as well start at once.
You must learn from your own mistakes.
You're the teacher.
I'm not ready.
I can't see anything.
I refused to be paid.
He was pleasantly surprised.
May I ask a question?
He rarely gives up.
I thought I'd surprise you.
You're double-parked.
He is a DJ.
This smells great! What are you cooking?
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
What scared you?
I think we're going to stay for another day.
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
Someone left the water running.
I didn't get the point of his speech.
I am almost ready.
You won't need that.
She is going to visit her grandmother on Saturday.
Tom isn't my brother.
What're we looking for?
Can I talk to you for a second, please?
He has his own room.
Strictly speaking, Chinese consists of hundreds of dialects.
Say what you have to say.
It already has taken me hours.
Come here, all of you.
I'm about to tell you the answer.
I didn't see anything.
I want to know what you're doing here.
Which direction did he go?
She didn't want him to play poker.
Don't get angry.
Don't look so suspicious.
They rowed up the river.
You're very rude.
My plan was eventually adopted.
How's your morning been?
I know who it is you're looking for.
Tickets are valid for just two days, including the day they are purchased on.
I like spending time with her.
He went on reading the book as if nothing had happened.
We want to go.
What time are you going on duty?
He loves to party.
There were two murders this month.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
Tom is a very wealthy man.
She pointed her finger at him.
Full body scanners were installed at the airport.
He wants vengeance.
Do you think animals have a soul?
Tom's sorry.
Have you met everyone here?
I have finished my work.
What a dope!
Is that why you want to kill me?
The path was narrow.
He sat at the edge of the stream.
I know that it is highly unlikely that anyone would be willing to help me.
How much should you exercise?
My friends stood by me during the court case.
I went to my bedroom and cried.
It turned out to be true.
I'm not going to die.
Is everything ready?
I've something interesting to tell you that you might find surprising.
She made him a simple dinner.
No one flinched.
He managed to escape.
She got brushed aside.
Is there a problem?
He's too old for you.
Both Tom and Mary blushed.
She loves him now more than she did before.
What did you just write in your notebook?
What can I do to help you?
His success was mostly due to good luck.
Please give my regards to your father.
There are lots of things we've got to fix.
Tom is an intriguing guy.
You don't know where it is, do you?
I have a friend whose father is a magician.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
Don't you have classes today?
The room is too small.
I thought you were my friend.
Birds fly in the sky.
Tom ought to stop doing that.
I know that Tom likes basketball.
I'm just not hungry.
Fortunately, the weather was good.
What are you guys drinking?
I don't think I can get along with him.
Have a good look at this picture.
We couldn't make out what she wanted.
I want mine.
I don't know what to do now.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
Help yourself to a drink.
They are singers.
This coffee tastes great.
Too much is at stake.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
Our children like dogs, but I prefer cats.
Is Tom still playing?
In spite of the rain, I went out.
With the bridge destroyed, there was nothing to do but swim.
What do you spend a majority of your time doing?
Tom said he knew Mary.
This is not my ticket.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
I don't feel comfortable posing in the nude.
I was daydreaming.
My, you're looking green around the gills.
How much money do I owe you?
Tom isn't stupid.
You're fearless.
The public bought it hook, line and sinker, didn't they?
They usually go to school by bicycle.
Take a look at this.
I want to go over these numbers with you.
It was not my intention.
Everybody needs a hobby.
Does your wife know?
If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while.
Do you have rain gear with you?
It is kind of pretty.
Please limit your presentation to 30 minutes.
The class went wild.
Would you like to eat something?
Aren't you going to report it?
We finally have you where we want you.
I have things to do tomorrow.
I want you to think about this.
I've caught a cold.
I can drive to Boston and back on one tank of gas.
She cremated him against his wishes.
I found the book which I had lost the day before.
Tom's eating.
I didn't find a thing.
Children are not allowed in.
You don't sound very surprised.
The front windshield of a car was smashed to pieces.
I think Tom said he'd be back.
You understand me very well.
Americans may regard shy people as less capable than those who are not shy.
In our next class, we will study the days of the week, the months, and the seasons.
Take your coat in case it rains.
Did you write this book?
Something happened.
It's good to talk to you.
How long did you stay?
I have looked everywhere, but I can not find my wallet.
I don't know why it happened.
They'll think of something.
The boy bowed to me.
Do you know what I mean?
He has a hat on.
Tom insisted he hadn't been drinking, but his slurred speech and unsteady gait gave him away.
Do it the way he tells you to.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
I'll lend it to you.
You have to be careful.
I know you didn't really want to come on this trip.
Hand it over.
They are both good.
The policeman blamed the taxi driver for the accident.
Didn't you read the book?
He banged his knee.
My father hates the summer heat.
I had no choice.
I think I'd rather not know.
I'm going to college.
Tom fixed everything.
I know you must be afraid.
Paper was first invented in China.
I can jump.
Don't ever talk to me again.
Tom stopped the engine.
I didn't know how to express myself.
You must work hard to succeed.
Things would never be the same.
I think we could help each other.
Can I see you tomorrow?
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
She was too tired to go on working.
I thought everyone was happy.
Don't tell me who I like.
Don't you think this suits me?
He's skilled at videogames.
This is my daughter's school.
You look nervous.
Don't drink the tap water.
We kissed each other.
This picture was taken three years ago.
He had no money and so could not buy any food.
We often associate black with death.
Say it clearly.
I will not let you pass.
My father is oblivious to the emotional pain his abuse caused me.
I never said no.
"Can I use your dictionary?" "Yes, here you are."
Tom has no idea what that means.
Anyone hurt?
I think I hurt his feelings.
This might not be such a good idea.
Are you OK?
They caught Tom.
Is there anything to eat?
Hold the box with both hands.
Take care of yourself, OK?
I think we're going to need more money.
What I did was wrong.
Let me get that for you.
They say that he will never return.
I want to run.
She has been sick since last Wednesday.
Weren't you here yesterday?
You don't seem to realize how serious this is.

I have done the best I could to help you. The rest is up to you.
I'm going to miss you, too.
Let's hope that doesn't happen.
Would you like to play with us?
Should we be worried?
Tom doesn't know where he was born.
My bonus doesn't come close to covering all the loan payments I have to make.
You were right, too.
He may be able to come tomorrow.
Follow my advice.
Generally speaking, women live longer than men.
They're very close friends.
Father bought me the latest model motorcycle.
Tom plays in a band.
Have a piece of pie.
She was advised by him not to go.
That company puts out a magazine, doesn't it?
I want to find true love.
I want soup.
I've got an appointment tomorrow with Tom.
They're not all busy.
Most, if not all, people enjoy eating.
I'll be in bed by the time you get home.
He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.
I want vengeance.
I can't stand the cold.
There's a gas leak.
She dumped me.
You don't have to do it immediately.
What do you learn English for?
You're not impressing me.
Would you please tell me the way?
Stand up straight.
I insist that he should go with us.
I read about it in the newspaper.
I don't like being surprised.
We'll find it.
The TV program seemed very interesting.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
They trusted you.
Their daughter is a nurse.
I'm fine, thank you.
Training for a marathon is taxing.
I should've known it was you.
I was stung by a bee.
I do not know how to drive a car.
It is necessary for you to stop smoking.
That's the way I like it.
May I have a glass of water?
He tricked me.
I didn't move.
My father runs a restaurant.
May I go home now?
I'm not your boyfriend.
My father sometimes goes abroad.
Actually, that's what I thought.
Everyone who worked on that project became a millionaire.
I want you gone by sunrise.
I didn't stop.
He backed his car into the garage.
I enjoyed this book.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
He earns his living by writing.
What do you feel like eating?
Let me see what it looks like.
I'm working on his car.
I'm used to this sort of thing.
What year were you born?
Maybe it wasn't so obvious.
We'd like separate checks.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
What does your son do?
You are a mean person.
You're safe.
Everybody took a hostile attitude toward illegal aliens.
I told you I'm not drunk.
Will you switch seats with me?
I'm through.
I thought they wouldn't come.
We're less than halfway to the top of the mountain. Are you already tired?
Close your eyes, and count to ten.
How many times a day do you feed your dog?
I wonder what that means.
I like him.
I really need to talk to you privately.
It is high time you started a new business.
He seemed really nervous.
I don't have a plan.
I spilled my drink.
It was simple.
Are you the author of this book?
I want to have a word with you.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
I've had to make some tough choices.
How was the beach?
Tom and Mary are the only survivors.
You're probably tired.
May I ask you a few questions?
I'm just beginning.
I don't think Tom realized just how much Mary loved him.
I have to stop.
We were thinking of asking you to join our company.
I slept in front of the TV.
He let me work in this office.
She called for help.
I've got a friend at the IRS.
How much are these potatoes?
I just did what you asked me to do.
I need a snack.
They slept in the same bed.
They set a new record for the longest kiss.
He and I are teachers.
The accident happened a year ago today.
What else can you do?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
You are my best friend.
He tried it over and over again.
I've never trusted strangers.
How did you lose it?
It's impolite to point.
I think you are the one who broke it.
I bet you've never climbed a tree.
I almost forgot that it was his birthday.
They have been good neighbors to this day.
It's a great way to make friends.
I was expecting the worst.
Tom got his hair cut.
I'm happy and satisfied.
Marry me.
Don't ever talk to me again.
He pretends that he's a stranger here.
Hey, can we get a move on?
I have a couple questions.
I am very sorry to inform you that she died.
It was very painful.
A truck was careering along the road.
I daydreamed all day.
I don't think Tom heard Mary.
Take a wild guess.
The old houses were torn down to make room for a supermarket.
Almost all the students believed the rumor.
Tom plays tennis three times a week.
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I unfolded the map on the desk.
Tom kept his illness a secret.
The dress fits you very well.
My wife is very upset.
I knew they were coming.
Does that mean you bought it?
Don't ask so many questions.
I was born there.
They can't hear you.
I like you a great deal.
I'm going to work out the problem by myself.
Tell the maid to make the beds.
He thinks he's so great.
I can't stand it anymore.
My house is a long way from here.
That's not what you said before.
We were all wrong.
May I be excused for a minute?
I think you should quit.
Meditation doesn't cost anything, but it takes time.
His new movie is disappointing.
I should have studied more.
Badgers dig deep holes.
I let them go.
I still don't like it.
I have to solve the problem myself.
You have a very logical way of thinking.
It's not a game.
What is a life worth living?
Let's get out of the rain.
Exercise makes your body strong.
This message turned out to be a little hard for me to write.
Do you believe in guardian angels?
You'd better do as you're told.
Where did he learn this?
I know you did this.
I had the exact same feeling.
The rebels made a barricade across the road.
Where were you when your wife disappeared, Tom?
We know what we have to do.
He repaired my watch for me.
We all wish for permanent world peace.
What kind of music do you like?
Don't scare me like that, OK?
I saw a flock of sheep.
Tom never listens to the teacher.
We can't work without electricity.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for the rest of his life.
I fail to understand his true aim.
Show me how it works.
Why don't you talk to me about it?
You are very brave.
Your work is below average.
You must be in love.
She provided me with some food.
He glanced at her with no sign of recognition.
I wish we had done more.
We'll never catch Tom.
I kid you not.
Better safe than sorry.
With all your money, you should be able to buy just about anything you want.
I know it's not fair.
Never speak ill of others.
He blamed his teacher for his failure in the entrance examination.
The money is at your disposal.
Did you hear that a burglar broke into the neighbor's house?
I know you feel lonely.
I thought you'd be older.
All my friends have bicycles.
I dream of becoming a teacher.
I want it to be a success.
This is someone I want you to meet.
A cop was killed.
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right away.
You were jealous, weren't you?
You don't expect me to face Tom alone, do you?
I think it's time for me to go back to work.
He talks as if he knew the secret.
He was completely engrossed in the book.
You don't want to do anything rash.
I am about to leave here.
I think it's better for us to adopt his plan.
Do you live alone?
Tom looks interested.
What exactly is that?
Are you allergic to any medicine?
We're playing cards.
This is a very rare specimen.
My mother has gone shopping.
I want to look like her.
My mom will kill me.
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
Tom wants to know why.
It doesn't look too hard.
We have run short of food.
We tied him up so that he wouldn't be able to escape.
Are you Tom Jackson by any chance?
I felt left out.
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
Have you finished breakfast yet?
You look happy.
You're creepy.
Do you want to come over and watch a movie?
I appreciate your telling me.
Tom only mentioned Mary twice.
He was a brave soldier.
I'm using the computer.
I don't want to live like that.
My son can already count up to one hundred.
You should buy him new toys.
Tom never gives anything to anybody.
I was discharged without notice.
We all live in the same dormitory.
She asked him to call her later.
It's just an expression.
We have illustrated the story with pictures.
You ought not to stay up so late.
The laws were very difficult to enforce.
I'll hurry.
She is no beauty.
What's your boyfriend's name?
Where is it hidden?
I am glad to see her.
This is a big project.
They have already begun.
Tom is a compulsive hoarder.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
This feels like silk.
She looks like a boy.
Choose your next words carefully.
I can't see well.
Everybody cheered.
Get out of my room.
She advised him to be more careful.
She always takes care of her children.
They got the short end of the stick.
He kissed his daughter on the forehead.
Come whenever you want to.
I have to take some photos for my class project.
Make sure that the dog does not escape.
This lake is among the deepest in the country.
You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.
I know why he did it.
Tom went inside.
I think you're interesting.
Are you suggesting it's a design flaw?
It's hard to get a taxi outside the station.
Don't make me do it again.
Are you looking for someone?
It's not a date.
I have been to the station to see him off.
I didn't ask for help.
I felt ill.
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten.
It's incredibly easy to cheat the system.
Safety is what matters most.
I want to get married, just not to you.
I think you owe me some money.
I'm glad to see you're OK.
She is saving her money with a view to taking a trip around the world.
I can run.
Forget about her.
Just do what you've got to do.
We were fully satisfied.
You must work hard to succeed.
If you're going to apologize, you should do it right away.
Tom burned all of the letters that Mary had sent him.
I think the story is true.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I have no way of knowing that.
Who knows?
You've got to tell Tom how you feel.
Could you please lend me your dictionary?
I feel like I could sleep all day.
Now drink up.
I share a house with two of my friends.
I just found out that my boyfriend has been stepping out on me.
You must do this alone.
I was out all day.
I was careful not to say anything to make him angry.
He found a ball in the garden.
She finished her work an hour in advance.
He was stupid enough to believe her.
I like her. She's so beautiful!
If we hurry, we'll make it.
Our city is getting bigger and bigger.
Some Germans work for only one euro an hour.
How much time and energy do you spend on projects that don't make you any money?
I feel like everyone is talking about me behind my back.
We apologize for any inconvenience.
Let me rephrase it.
Needless to say, theft was a rare occurrence.
What will you have to drink?
Why did you lie?
It's no use complaining.
Turkey was stronger than Greece.
Do your job.
We're downsizing.
Actually, I don't like the way your hair is done.
I'll make some coffee.
He is my friend. Do you guys know him?
Can you remember the first time we met each other?
She was playing the piano at that time.
I can hardly breathe.
I thought you'd be grateful.
I was knocked unconscious.
I don't have time for that.
Bring me a dry towel.
No matter how hard he tried, he could not get out of the maze.
They don't have one.
Please let me explain.
He lives on this street.
Do you have time?
Tom gave Mary the first piece of cake.
I think we're in trouble.
I love life.
I have standards.
Don't get too comfortable.
I'm back.
A large amount of money was spent on the new bridge.
How could you say something like that?
Is that so terrible?
Can you please close the window?
You can go there in a boat.
Is that a riddle?
I really doubt it.
They live in a house.
You don't want to keep him waiting.
You won't be disappointed.
Could you speak up? I can't hear you.
He turned pale when he heard that news.
We're gardeners.
The citizens of this small community don't condone public displays of affection.
Where is he running now?
We're ready.
I slept through the storm.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
Where are my slippers?
You have a really good sense of direction.
Mary is expecting a baby in October.
I'd like to try doing this without your help.
Why would I want to do something like that?
Please wait here for a while.
The pain still hasn't gone away.
Most children love ice cream.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
I made him cry.
Did you take the book back to the library?
The children are building sand castles on the beach.
Could you please call me back tomorrow?
I thought you were older than me.
Are you going to eat the rest of your stew?
Hitler assumed power in 1933.
Christmas is fast approaching.
Mary had a flower in her hair.
We really don't have a choice.
You gave me this picture a long time ago.
Don't swear in public.
You're very sophisticated.
You don't owe anybody anything.
We're prisoners.
Everyone stayed calm.
There are four main causes of alcohol-related death. Injury from car accidents or violence is one. Diseases like cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, heart and blood system diseases are the others.
They all did it.
When ice melts, it becomes water.
I can't make it any clearer.
We are changing our clothes.
Let me borrow that.
It's unlocked.
The food seems very delicious.
I went to the market.
Our education system needs to be seriously revamped.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Children like to pretend to be adults when they play.
I want a lot more.
The boy almost drowned.
She attempted to persuade her father.
Don't you watch old movies?
They can raise your rent.
She persuaded him to do it.
You don't have to go.
Has anything strange happened?
I am very grateful to you for your advice.
Would you like to hear my new song?
Why did you go to Tokyo?
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Why did you call me?
It is impossible to substitute machines for people.
I'd like to go for a walk.
I don't know what I owe you.
I looked it up on the Internet.
Everyone kept quiet.
Your friends sound nice.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
Don't put it on my desk.
Tom is a financial analyst.
I think we've got a problem.
I can't do it right away.
That's not how I remember it.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
Is it all right to eat out tonight?
When did you start dating?
Tom didn't appear.
They asked a lot of questions about my past experience.
I'm sick of fish.
Tom asked us to sit down.
It just was not my day yesterday.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I'm all yours.
I know where we can get one.
You could have drowned.
You and I are the same age.
I've been doing it all my life.
I was offended.
Strictly speaking, his answer is not correct.
I only did it for your own good.
I want to say I'm sorry.
They made fun of my clothes.
I have three cousins.
Did you get all that?
When do you think he'll be back?
Your answer is far from perfect.
Give the television remote control back to me.
You don't have the guts.
She was supposed to call him at 2:30.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
Have you really already found a new job?
We're baffled.
It took all day.
It is not known when he came up to London.
He did it in front of the staff.
Without Tom's advice, Mary would have failed.
I am at the end of my patience.
He's still sick in bed.
The news is too good to be true.
Do you want another one of these?
I think we need more ice.
I've got a bad memory for names.
I can't believe you're getting married.
Please sing.
He is proud of being a musician.
He smiled and said goodbye.
I will write to you soon.
What if somebody sees you?
It's hard for me to live on my small income.
Don't ask me so many questions. Use your head.
I'm being treated like a child.
Don't kid me!
Is the job too much for you?
I hope you've got some proof to back up your allegations.
They're all tourists.
She's waiting for you at home.
You cannot park your car here.
Having a small flashlight in your pocket may come in handy.
He didn't answer the phone, so I sent him an email.
Today was a good day, so I'll sleep soundly tonight.
The motive for the murder is not yet known.
It means a lot to me to know that you want me to stay.
If he keeps threatening you, then you should go to the police.
Did you recognize any of those people?
I'm curious.
That doesn't cut the mustard.
We're not family.
Would you mind speaking more slowly?
I'm not a robot.
I'm beginning to feel stupid.
I'm sure Tom was involved.
It takes time to heal from a divorce.
What do you want?
I believe he is competent.
I know what it feels like.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
You can go however you like.
I can't show up looking like I've been working on the farm all day.
The wound left a scar on her arm.
I thought you'd be happy.
Did you tape that concert?
She's an angel.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Why would you want to leave?
This is what I can do for you.
Why don't you cut your hair?
Most people think so.
Neither is beautiful.
I'd like to try on this dress.
This school was founded in 1650.
Drink less and sleep more.
I don't like chocolate.
I can teach you how to swim.
He came by car.
Tom has a pacemaker.
What do you think is going to happen?
I will look it up in the dictionary.
Which one will you choose?
You should try it on.
What do you want to have?
Why don't you come dancing with me?
I hope you won't be disappointed.
That car is quite new.
By the way, I think you're really nice.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
She treated him like a king.
If you leave right now, you'll be in time for the plane for sure.
Is this your house?
There are a lot of different people in Europe.
Oh, come on.
He attributed his failure to bad luck.
She made her husband an apple pie.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
Would you mind if I left early?
Your bike is better than mine.
She knew better than to tell him such a story.
My study is upstairs.
I have absolutely nothing to do.
Keep your hands off my bicycle.
It's a bargain.
You or I will be chosen.
Are you in a bad mood?
I just can't resist chocolate.
Can you juggle?
Can I go there now?
We found the boy sound asleep.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
I'll monitor your progress from my computer.
Let me remind you of something.
Lightning struck his house.
Are all these books yours?
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
Please put it back in its place.
Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you.
May I ask why?
I caught a cold two days ago.
They won't have arrived yet.
We're ambitious.
We could walk.
When do you study?
Ready or not, here I come.
I may outlive you.
Your soul needs to be saved.
Don't worry. Tom won't let us down.
All of my things are gone.
Why can't I see you?
How come you didn't come to the party?
She is traveling around the world.
Tom was accepted to Harvard.
Your objection has been noted.
You aren't going to tell Tom, are you?
All your problems have been solved.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I don't really like you.
Tom started loading the gun.
Did you see Tom at school today?
This is a good system.
She took off her coat.
He died of old age two years ago.
We're on schedule.
How come you didn't call me last night?
It seemed appropriate.
You look fat.
I've never come across such a strange case.
The old man sat all alone.
I went to the mall with my friends.
What's a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this?
He telephoned me again and again.
Some people have a terror of mice.
The door blew open.
Could you tell me the way to the port?
It's supposed to be the other way around.
Here is the map.
Tom and Mary realized that they weren't really compatible.
It was hard as rock.
This problem is hard to solve.
I feel bad about ruining your party.
I'll be glad to drink a glass of champagne.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Don't buy me presents anymore.
What's up, dude?
He gave me a ride home.
Tell them what happened.
You're probably too young to understand what's happening.
I'll leave it up to you.
I hope he won't be disappointed.
When will her new novel be published?
Can I borrow your tennis racket today?
I want to surprise him.
Do you know where I live?
All the tickets are sold out.
We've achieved a lot in the past three years.
This box is made of cardboard.
Tom used to be aggressive.
Women are better at this than men.
We want peace in the world.
We can't avoid postponing our departure.
A good idea occurred to him.
What did you do last Sunday?
That's for you.
Don't come any closer.
I don't know how to reply to that question.
He cooked up a good excuse for not going to the party.
This chimney is made of brick.
You still haven't told me why you quit your job.
Her hair is very short.
I had to work last weekend.
We're different.
We will have to put off the soccer game because of the bad weather.
He ran away as soon as he saw me.
He is teaching me.
I need more power.
My brother is out.
This one is on me.
We celebrated Mother's 45th birthday.
I was the last to know.
Tom gave me this watch.
We're not killers.
Tom couldn't contain his anger.
This island belonged to France in the 19th century.
How many of you are going?
We're not living together.
I don't get it.
All you have to do is fill in this form.
She was similar to me in many ways.
Get out of my life!
He likes me.
You may choose whichever you want.
Glasses and dishes were broken.
Tom told me you were afraid.
Am I wrong?
I would like a room.
I had no idea what I should write.
I don't want you two talking about me.
I'm afraid of the same thing.
I disapprove of what you say.
She acknowledged having made a mistake.
"Everything accomplished starts with the dream of it," is a saying we all know to be true.
Do you want to take that risk?
The interview began at 10 o'clock.
Do you need me to give you some money?
Classical music is not my cup of tea.
I do like you.
Forewarned is forearmed.
Can I borrow yours?
I'll lend you some books of my brother's.
Cut the cake with that knife.
The fuel gauge is broken.
The Coliseum was the former arena in ancient Rome.
There is nothing new under the sun.
A tea with lemon, please.
My father doesn't drink too much sake.
Come on, tell me.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
She left here right away.
Let's not waste this opportunity.
I just started crying.
He warned us not to enter the room.
I can't do this again.
There's something I have to ask you.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
She pointed her finger at him accusingly.
I'm sure you must have a lot of questions.
Have I convinced you?
This is illegal.
Don't you have any change?
We admire you.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Those were the best years of my life.
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.
The bigger boys torment the little ones.
Are you able to buy a ticket after boarding the train?
We were caught in a shower while we were on a picnic.
I like the way you smile.
We had a good time last night.
An old man broke into our conversation.
I won't say it again.
Who should look after the elderly?
That's not a cat. It's a dog.
You understand Korean, don't you?
She came to like the new teacher.
Out of my way!
How do you know where I live?
No taxi stopped.
Does that work for you?
The wall is covered with graffiti.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
I don't know much about Australia.
Let's eat the ice cream now before it melts.
She avoids me.
As it is, I can do nothing.
He runs a shoe shop.
You're a smart boy.
I'd rather stay.
Tom isn't as fast as I am.
Everyone is scared.
He is able to swim like a fish.
Excuse me, I'm coming through.
I felt as if I had no choice.
His visits became less frequent as time passed.
He's playing with my cat.
We spent more money than was expected.
Let's do the homework together.
This is the important part.
Most Japanese houses are built of wood.
You will be all right again in a couple of days.
Are you enjoying yourself?
We all have passed the test.
How are you taking it?
Where is the Chinese embassy?
Clean that up.
Don't you like us?
Could you please tell me again who your father is?
I saved you.
Tom wanted one, but he had no idea where he could get one.
Please don't cry.
She disliked her husband.
Can you give me an example?
They settled in the country.
I never knew that.
I'm not here for you.
I thought it was a joke.
Do you mind if I sleep here?
A toothache deprived me of sleep.
May I borrow your phone?
The situation resulted in violence.
The soldiers opened fire.
I didn't mean to make him cry.
He speaks Russian.
I like what I see.
You have to be patient.
Tom doesn't like computers.
He was writing a letter while listening to music.
Have a good time.
I am Finnish, but I speak also Swedish.
Tom said it was fun.
The weather report is bad.
He scraped the mud off his boots.
Your cat is fat.
I believe I can trust you.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you did your best.
The rain stopped at last.
I never for a moment imagined that my blog would become so popular.
I shouldn't have to tell you to do your homework.
It's very sticky.
It's one of the oldest buildings in Boston.
I'd like to pay by check.
Have you finished your homework yet?
Where I am doesn't matter.
Isn't that what you said?
This is getting complicated.
I know what you know.
I don't believe that Santa Claus is imaginary.
I told you to stay in the house.
When you're eighteen years old, you're an adult in the United States.
You're back again.
The protesters set many cars on fire.
I'm departing this evening.
Drink this juice.
Let's discuss the matter right now.
I'm studying French grammar.
He fell down on the ice and hurt his leg.
I love all of you.
I wanted to die.
Not everyone is like you.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes when you speak English.
I truly apologize.
Do you have a car?
I don't know what you're so worried about.
You don't know my brother.
The silver is on the table.
Take me to your leader.
I am feeling sad about it.
This piece of information is very important to us.
She mistook my brother for me.
You can make it.
He doesn't remember anything.
The company, although with some exceptions, usually utilizes its resources very well.
I don't know anybody by that name.
I ran into an old friend.
I'm going to tell Tom that.
They're still young.
Tom often cries when he's drunk.
It was the calm before the storm.
You have got to be kidding.
You're too loud.
I have a client waiting in the waiting room.
What seems simple to you seems complex to me.
You're not fit.
It seems that he has something to do with the matter.
Living conditions were hard.
You're afraid that I'm right, aren't you?
Tom studies at Harvard.
I saw this movie a very long time ago.
There's only a day left.
I must warn them.
She couldn't suppress her emotions.
You need to have exact change to pay the toll of the expressway.
We can't go there.
They want you to resign.
Do you like her songs?
They'll go shopping.
If more people had voted, we would have won the election.
He asked for my advice.
Tom wasn't smiling when he entered the room.
It's worse than you think.
I can't tell you any more, I've already said too much.
We're almost out of time.
Excuse my clumsiness.
They are leaving Japan tomorrow.
It's very kind of you to help me.
Please bring me some glasses.
I'm not outgoing.
Who wrote the letter?
We were surprised by his behavior.
We want something new.

I am going to do it whether you agree or not.
He decided to have the operation.
He lives in his car.
He ran up the stairs.

I'm sure we all agree.
I'm just not sure.
Can I borrow some money from you?
Let's kiss.
Have you put on sunscreen?
Where did you get all that money from?
Is the dog swimming?
Is this love?
You must do it at once.
I had a lovely night.
It happens to all of us.
How was your summer?
That's enough for today.
I couldn't control my anger.
It's been a long night.
You owe me something.
Don't you think it's strange that he's not here?
It's none of your business.
They're both in love with the same girl.
Did he touch you?
He pushed me gently.
He held a pen in his hands.
You look very dignified.
A sponge absorbs liquids.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
"Are those your books?" "No, they aren't."
Don't forget to put on some sunscreen.
Give me a call later, OK?

How much is the ticket?
Japan today is not what it was even ten years ago.

You're the teacher.
This is exactly what I needed.
People say that he is the richest man in this town.
Is it complicated?
Help me if you can.
When did you start dating?
I'm sick of your complaints.
I don't plan on losing.
Everywhere you look you can see young couples kissing.
I know you don't trust us.
You're the only one for me now.
I really don't understand women.
He had the good fortune to find a good wife.

You have no evidence.
I'm not going to do that unless you help me.
How nice of you!
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I dreamed that I was buying this guitar.

I think Tom would tell the truth.
What languages are spoken in America?
They are all alike.
I'm not going to skate today.

I gave it back.
God sent a sign.
The room is hot.
She married him for his money.
You should follow his advice.
Besides being a surgeon, he was a famous writer.
She is a real beauty.
Hold on, please.
I explained it to him.
Wiser words were never spoken.
You just have to ask for it.
Have yourself a drink.
Is there something there?
Do you think Tom hates me?
I've tried.
There are still a lot of things to do.
I didn't receive even one letter from her.
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it.
She found me a good seat.
They're similar.
I'll study harder in the future.
Can I take a picture here?
I don't want to lose Mary.
Tom is dangerous.
Do you want me to come cook you something?
I always have a look at the newspaper before breakfast.
Mary is not wearing a bra.
Don't tempt me.
I can't believe you turned down that job.
It's Tom's birthday next week.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
It's even worse than it looks.
He negotiated a lower price with the real estate agent.
There's a body in the trunk of the car.
I don't like big dogs.
I can't kiss you now.
I don't feel like it.
He burned himself badly.
Are you really not going?
Do you realize the danger you're in?
I got lost three times.
I said yes.
They invited me to the party.
Do you know of any inexpensive stores?
They're not going to be able to find the hotel.
It will not make much difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
That's what I heard.
She is just a child.
Do not underestimate my power.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
The company wants to employ 20 people.
Are you enjoying it?
We miss you very much.

The dog next door is always barking.
I'm not good at this.

He asked her if she knew him.
I managed to find his office.
They seem surprised.
Where is the boy?
I had a conversation with Tom.
Tom told me you were afraid.
She'll lend you a book.
She complained that the picture was too revealing.
Will you turn on the television?
They've written a bill for health care.
I will go along with you as far as the station.
He reached across the table and shook my hand.
I feel it's a tad risky to do that.
I like watching TV.
You can't have the job.
He always plans a thing out carefully before he does it.
I'll allow you to go.

You didn't miss a thing.
The architecture in this part of the city is ugly.

I've heard that name somewhere before.
You're doing an excellent job.
I screwed up the very first note.

That is something you should not have said.
Tom cooks for us every day.
Tom and Mary sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
Do whatever you think is right.
There was no damage.
The wind is blowing from the north.
Don't talk to your father like that.
Tom said that he didn't enjoy his job.
I'm not good at public speaking.
He asked for food.
I left my gloves in the library.
May I call on you today?
You can't give me orders.
What're you looking for?
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
It was easy for me to do so.
Does this bus go to the beach?
He writes scripts for TV shows.
Would you mind if I swam in your pool?
There is a lot of furniture in this room.
It's very good.
Tom isn't feeling at all well.
I spilled coffee on your tablecloth.
Why wouldn't you listen to his advice?
Such a person invariably expends his physical energy more slowly.
Your pants are unzipped.
I'm 18 years old.
I'll go next.
Where did you go to school?
He was in critical condition.
I want you to be quiet.
It's our only hope.
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
It's made of leather.
Have you met him yet?
He is a reporter for Time magazine.
You need to be careful when you're driving a car.
It was ages ago.
The boy was shirtless.
Was that you at the door?
I'm going for a run. Do you want to come?
He has a good memory.
There is no paint.
Tom answered the question correctly.
I have no idea what that could be.
You've taken everything.
I have a slight headache today.
There's no danger now.
She smiled at the sight of her mother.
Minorities are despised in many countries.
Where's the nearest church?
What are you here for?
Tell me what I did wrong.
I was eating dinner then.
You're very sophisticated.
That's no secret.
We all have flaws.
He lost his eyesight.
How did he come here?
I've already paid you.
Don't hesitate to ask if you want anything.
I'm glad I don't have your job.
It was impressive.
I was dancing.
I have so much to show you.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
He stayed in London for a time.
One morning, she unexpectedly met him on the street.
I prefer going out to staying at home.
I've never told anyone that before, not even my mother.
Why don't you look it up in the phone book?
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
Nice shot!
His debt reached a hundred dollars.
I don't know how many minutes we've got.
I understand this.
If you want to become a good writer, you need to practice writing.
I did it just now.
She kept on working.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I think I did well.
Tom couldn't make a living as a musician.
Have they made progress?
This criminal is morally depraved.
She was absent from class.
Although the sun was out, it was cold.
That's no excuse.
She's the closest thing to family he has.
We need to clarify a few details.
She advised him to go there alone.
It's raining cats and dogs.
I want to hear what everyone has to say.
It was very windy.
He saved her at the cost of his own life.
I was going to write to you, but I forgot.
She is Canadian.
When did your friend leave for America?
I saw him wash the car.
I have needs.
She was the last to cross the finishing line.
They went to the hospital.
I didn't mean to give you that impression.
I'd like to be more like you.
I'd like to speak with you.
Tom went to Boston.
I'm fighting mad because someone stole my bike.
Are there many animals in the zoo?
His novel was translated into Japanese.
I have a bad cold.
Can I touch it?
Can you still remember where we first met?
I'm from the city.
I want to make sure you know what to do.
I have difficulty chewing.
Don't wait up.
No one flinched.
They're spies.
We cannot meet your demands.
I can't help you, Tom.
His mother speaks Italian.
I taught my wife how to drive.
You are crazy.
All my friends are getting married.
You weren't serious, were you?
I only quit because you asked me to.
He made her cry.
I was hoping you'd know.
Don't throw away this magazine. I haven't read it yet.
Quit behaving like a kid.
Your guess is wrong.
Guys are stupid.
I had fun.
He lived abroad for many years.
I can't recall her name at the moment.
I wash my face every morning.
How did that happen?
I felt guilty about it.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
I held on to the rope tightly so I wouldn't fall.
I think that you and I should probably be able to get along better.
I can't help crying.
The typhoon gathered strength.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Don't move until I tell you to.
Are you serious about getting married?
Make a decision.
I told you it didn't work.
I have not had anything to eat since this morning.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
There are a few boats on the lake.
I want to know who sent you.
What do you think she is doing now?
That song reminds me of a certain girl.
Sing us a song, please.
I never thought about that.
She likes sleeping.
Please give my regards to your father.
I'm in trouble now.
I feel really stupid.
She nursed him back to health.
I don't know if he is a doctor.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Maybe you don't know this, but nobody could ever take your place.
What did he not buy?
Who is the woman in the brown coat?
What school did you go to?
No one is innocent.
He asked for money.
You are in my way.
I suppose you want to ask me where I've been.
She is anxious to visit Europe.
He and I are cousins.
Today is a beautiful day.
The car broke down.
You are good.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
Tom is now in danger.
We shouldn't judge people by how they look.
Do you feel like eating something?
I want back what you've taken from me.
He's working on it.
Don't deceive me.
It never occurred to me that the whole thing might be a scam.
Are you happy with that?
We were crowded into the small room.
I think you look hot.
I enjoy traveling.
I'm not afraid to fight.
We're ready now.
I want you to go.
I'm about ready.
I'm sorry, we don't accept checks.
I made a careless mistake.
I think you are the one who broke it.
Tom has a warped sense of humor.
I saw a woman in black.
Could you draw a map for me?
Japanese is my mother tongue.
I thought you were my friend.
She is muttering to herself.
Everybody calls me Tom.
My brother gave me a charming baby doll.
I had nothing to do with the accident.
"Thank you, I'd love to have another piece of cake," said the shy young man.
Don't ask me about the speech.
Tom doesn't want to go to bed right now.
You will soon come to like this town.
You need to tell Tom the truth.
What is the number?
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I like the mountains more than I like the sea.
What time did you arrive there?
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
We happened to meet at the station.
I am not well at all.
This book is both interesting and instructive.
Your parents didn't come, did they?
I felt out of place.
We're not going, are we?
Why don't you sit down for a moment?
Who is playing the piano?
God knows that it is true.
That's right.
I can't believe he kissed you.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
Are you as tall as me?
She loves shopping.
Serving people is his sole purpose in life.
Unfortunately, elephants can't sing well.
I couldn't see what was inside.
I'm not sleepy.
You're talented.
I saw you.
You're up to something.
Are you still married?
You've been had.
She promised that she would meet him after school.
She likes to arrange flowers.
She is a reliable person.
I arrived here at eight this morning.
That's exactly what I think.
Tom drinks a little.
I've changed clothes.
Tom doesn't know how computers work.
Tom wants this room spotless.
I do it because I want to.
Why didn't you run?
Does your dog bite?
They're all here.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
We baked it together.
Tom doesn't think he'll be able come tomorrow.
This tastes pretty good to me.
Spending time with your family should be your priority.
I remembered it.
How many of these things have you made?
I'm delighted to meet you.
You don't have the nerve.
I'd like to know what it is.
He said that I must go there.
Would you care for more coffee?
Don't swear in public.
There's no rush.
It's OK to take a picture from outside.
It's a pity that he can't marry her.
We are apt to make mistakes.
She runs fastest in our class.
It was hot in the room.
Don't you want to be in love again?
It's beautiful.
After I graduated from college, I spent two years traveling around the world.
My brother gave me a pair of jeans.
Is there a drink minimum?
I think Tom didn't tell us everything.
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
I'd like to be with Tom.
This looks like a trap.
The road was clear of traffic.
Why would I be nervous?
What did they hit you with?
The campers were hard up for water because their well had run dry.
I've been thinking about it, too.
Thank you for the wonderful meal.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
He came home very late.
You have beautiful hair.
She prepared a wonderful meal for us.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.
Stop trying.
I insist that we do this now.
It appears to me that you are right.
Let's not waste our money.
He looked back at us many times and walked away.
You've seen enough.
He went around the neighborhood collecting signatures.
When did you visit your friends?
I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it.
Hurry up.
You're jealous.
I think you should see a doctor.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
Somehow, he weaseled himself out of jury duty.
There was no response.
He always values his wife's opinions.
What would cause this?
I looked around me.
Everyone seems to agree.
It's always worth a try.
This part of the museum is temporarily off-limits to visitors.
I don't really have a gun.
It's probably just a phase.
I share your feelings.
Cheers!
Tom told me he was really busy.
Where did they come from?
The child came aboard the plane in a good mood.
Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
Don't scream, or I'll scream louder.
She was advised by him to give up drinking.
No more questions, please.
He's active and fit.
Don't you just love this town?
I only need two of these.
We can't forget Tom.
She danced with joy.
He is leaving Narita for Hawaii this evening.
I just want you all to know you can depend on me.
I made a bad decision.
Did I wake you?
I'll take care of it as soon as I can.
If you could go back in time, what would you change?
I'm not sure where Tom lives.
I want a donut.
Who's on duty today?
I don't know why I bother with you.
Why aren't you married?
I thought about what a jerk I had been.
This is a stressful situation.
I paid in advance.
He never takes into account the fact that I am very busy.
We are looking forward to going on a hike next week.
Why not try that delicious wine?
Do you believe in fairies?
You really should buy a new car.
Do you have a search warrant?
I hate Mondays.
We couldn't find out her whereabouts.
Isn't it about time you guys buried the hatchet and let bygones be bygones?
He gave me a lecture on drinking.
I'd say you're jealous.
Has Tom eaten yet?
We have to be careful with expenses.
It's a bit wobbly.
What do you know about him?
I went to Tom's apartment.
I'll certainly miss him.
I was very hungry.
He was raised in an artistic family.
Above all, don't forget to write me.
Did you wash that?
He returned home without telling us.
I have lost my watch.
At times, I can't trust him.
He's the black sheep of the family.
You are a genius.
I made this doghouse by myself.
My uncle has a deep interest in art.
Are you falling in love with me?
I've done it.
Time flies like an arrow.
He forgot to turn off the light.
She is taller than her sister.
I know what those books are like.
I am not proud of this.
I'm going to make you an offer that you can't refuse.
He denies having done it.
That's the last thing I would do.
We must continue to study as long as we live.
I'm fascinated by cats.
You can choose whichever color you like.
We all have stomachaches.
He was found guilty of murder.
I don't know who my mother is.
I hate flying.
Do you know where I live?
Tom is a bit small for his age.
I guess I'd better get back to work.
Give him an inch and he'll take a mile.
The sky cleared up.
There are turtles that are more than two centuries old.
You can't put off doing that any longer.
Please make the bed.
Put on your shoes. Let's go out for dinner.
Leave that alone.
Are you growing a beard?
My mother cooks well.
She is powerful.
She drives me crazy.
What exactly did you say?
She is mad at me.
What a beautiful sweater!
Please remain seated.
I get goose bumps when I see a horror movie.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Do you see anything?
Why are you following me?
I made Tom laugh today.
His cousin, whose name I forget, was a nurse.
My husband is always reading in bed.
We enjoyed ourselves at the party.
Tom forgot.
Let's try to clear up this misunderstanding.
I just want to go back to class.
Get out of my sight.
You don't have to apologize.
Nothing will take me away from you.
Who will you give the book to?
She doesn't want him to buy an expensive engagement ring.
She has a round face.
It reminded me of you.
His girlfriend has lost weight.
That's why I'm telling you not to go alone.
Life is a great mystery.
He thinks that they are not sentient beings.
A great crowd waited for the president to speak.
He was desperate to get married.
I've never seen Tom do what you say he always does.
The teacher got well again.
I look on you as my best friend.
I really think you should leave.
Some people compare life to a stage.
We saw the lady carried away to the hospital.
She mistook me for my brother.
Is everybody ready for the trip?
Tom liked what he saw.
She went out without saying a word.
Stay out of it.
I prefer it that way.
I find you very attractive.
I'm a patient.
I wish you'd never been born.
There are a lot of tall buildings in New York.
What do I mean to you?
I need a bigger frying pan.
He is a good doctor.
Everybody blames you.
I'm not dangerous.
You've got to be bold!
I can not bear this noise any more.
He dyed his hair black.
I'd like to change clothes.
I don't know what I've been so afraid of.
I want to wash up first.
Be prepared for the worst.
Where were you when I needed you?
How is the family doing?
You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?
I met some hikers on the mountain.
She asked him to read it for her because she had lost her glasses.
It's already dark outside.
I'm sorry, Tom, I can't do that.
I'm not a liar.
I'm sick of hearing it.
Don't expect overtime.
Canadian officials weighed the supplies of each man.
I'm a normal guy.
That seems like a good idea.
Helen Keller was deaf and blind.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
Japan is to the east of China.
They were so frightened that they couldn't move an inch.
Don't let your feelings show.
I know that.
I thought it was a secret.
There is an urgent need for the local government to help the homeless.
Why don't you stay a minute?
We're going to be working late.
This new Macintosh computer puts the competition to shame.
You are tallest.
You gave me this picture a long time ago.
I didn't sleep much last night.
They told me it was your fault.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
We prefer to stay here.
The choice is yours.
Don't complain.
The cat crossed the street.
Everything about this is wrong.
Are you up?
This tree does not bear fruit.
Tom always dresses in black or some other dark color.
Is this all we need?
Why didn't you do that?
He was buried in this graveyard.
I think we'd better take a break.
They're not telling us the truth.
I'll never learn.
She put on socks.
Be honest with me.
Tom won.
He was conspicuous by his absence.
You can go to the station by bus.
He is, without question, the best man for the job.
I don't know how to explain it.
I don't date.
He was the last to leave.
May I have a second helping?
This could be serious.
You are probably wrong.
My mother was in the hospital during the summer.
How long did they live in England?
It's lost.
You're very tall.
It cannot be helped.
You remind me of your mother.
Tell me what Tom said.
I don't want to participate in the ceremony.
Don't resist us.
Where is the cat?
Tears are a child's weapon.
Stop taking things so personally.
Where are my books?
It should be no problem.
We went to the mountains to ski.
I talked to everybody.
They'll tell you the truth.
We overslept.
There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
You should use deodorant.
I got an email yesterday that was written in French.
I really need to go.
The temperature is above freezing today.
Tom noticed that his hands weren't clean.
I'll babysit your kids for you.
You made my day.
Did you do all this?
Let him go.
Tom wished that he could play tennis as well as Mary.
Our city is rather small in comparison with Tokyo.
Where was I?
It's redundant.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
One of my suitcases is missing.
What if they don't like me?
Tom isn't ashamed of what he did.
What should you do if you are bitten by a cobra?
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
I feel a little awkward.
I can't believe I showed you that.
Did that work?
May I use your car today?
Tom often smiles.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
I didn't want to surprise you.
Don't do it!
You did this.
I'd die without you.
We have no other choice.
You're in luck. The plane is on time.
It looked fresh.
She ordered him to clean up his room.
I thought you were serious.
I took it for granted that she had received my letter.
I think about Tom all day.
You'll have to take his place in case he can't come.
That's a lot of money.
Now, what was your name again?
She doesn't understand you.
They were very kind to me.
This camera is the one that Tom bought last Thursday.
It depends on what you mean.
He found the box under the table.
You're fortunate.
When I'm hot, a glass of cool water really refreshes me.
I have no idea what you mean.
This is also my first time.
Are you all right?
If I were free, I could help you.
What kind of ship is that?
Go away.
He failed the entrance exam.
I don't want to go to jail.
As soon as I can get my son to scan our family photos, I'll upload some of them to our website.
I will never see him.
If you're not listening to the radio, turn it off.
That's just the way it is.
I have abandoned the idea of buying a house.
It is said that he is the richest man in the world.
Not knowing what to do, I asked him for help.
How do you feel at this moment?
Those who don't want to go, don't need to go.
Tom is still in the classroom studying.
We're both right.
I usually walk to school.
When did you become a teacher?
Do you have a hunting license?
I never should've broken up with Mary.
For someone who's supposed to be an expert, you don't seem to know much.
Sorry, I didn't know you were still here.
The train got in on time.
I look forward to corresponding with you.
I'm in a hurry today.
Can you determine what happened?
Tom seems dangerous.
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
Have you ever been to New York?
Mary is the girl of my dreams.
You're resilient.
His father had died of cancer 10 years ago.
Don't cave into their demands.
Are you going to save us?
I'm going to do some shopping.
Which TV show do you like the most?
Have you gone completely insane?
I don't even know you.
What's the emergency?
I'm the one who built this.
Can you find out?
You'd be the one to know.
You made a good decision.
Would you like to have tea with us this afternoon?
I had hardly gotten into bed when the telephone began to ring.
What are some foods you usually eat with your children?
I won't be at the opening ceremony.
I don't feel like working.
If I'd had a little more money, I would have bought it.
We got behind the car and pushed.
See you tomorrow.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
What I want to know are the facts.
How did you get so strong?
More than 40 percent of the students go to university.
That was great.
No one escaped alive.
That's why he got angry.
Last winter, I went skiing in Canada.
She looks lonesome.
Someone stole my wallet.
The first stage is complete.
He is full of ambition.
I hear footsteps outside.
Are you a student?
Both of us want to see the movie.
Have you finished dressing?
I am an English teacher.
I have urgent matters to attend to.
It has been a long time since I saw him.
Did you break up with Tom or did he break up with you?
She owns many valuable works.
What happened to the others?
He moves quickly.
Your prophecy has come true.
I didn't realize it until much later.
You may bring whoever wants to come.
He has had a long teaching career.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Tom is not as fat as I am.
I'm not sure if this is correct.
You're going to regret this.
Tom started crying.
Give her a doll.
My parents send you their best regards.
We were held up for two hours on account of an accident.
May I use your eraser? I seem to have lost mine.
English is spoken in many countries around the world.
He broke the door open.
Go ahead, try it now.
I will always love Mary.
You understand me very well.
I haven't been back here since the incident.
Let's play catch.
She killed herself yesterday.
I think what you say is true.
In my opinion, he is correct.
Do you want to do this now?
I want you to drop it.
Do you know the reason?
Why don't we take him a bottle of wine?
You must think of your family.
It would be a good idea if I went.
The cat scared me.
How does he do this?
He used me as a guinea pig.
Tom was late for class, as is often the case.
Easy come, easy go.
You're nice.
She kept on working.
You should get married again.
That's the absolute truth.
Will you lend me your bicycle?
I ought to go there, but I won't.
He has not yet succeeded.
I'll help you as much as I can.
His chances for making a great deal of money are excellent.
Step aside.
There would be no competition.
The old castle is in a sad state.
We've made plenty of money doing this.
I belong to the karate club.
Her speech was excellent.
You're not upset, are you?
I want to settle down.
He does nothing but cry.
Am I mistaken?
America is a country of immigrants.
It began to rain before I got home.
We didn't help Tom escape.
The hinges are really squeaky. Could you oil them please?
I just wanted some advice from someone who's already been to Boston.
I was absent from work yesterday.
Don't use his real name.
I like to watch TV.
There is an urgent need for blood donors.
What's the purpose of your visit?
What do you want to be?
How many days does it usually take to get there?
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
We must sleep at least seven hours a day.
I didn't know you were awake.
How are you related?
I'm sorry about last night.
Things change from time to time, and one should change with them.
How did you get here so fast?
Don't you have anything smaller than this?
The floorboards creak a bit when you walk across them.
He put the book on the shelf.
I never wrote to her, despite the urge to do so.
I don't feel like translating this sentence.
I trusted you.
Don't move.
He made up his mind to go there.
He mailed a letter home.
I refused to believe it.
Don't forget to answer his letter.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
We got off on the wrong foot.
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
Tom called Mary every day.
It's about time.
Mary is going to open a gift from her boyfriend.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
We will keep the peace at all costs.
He is washing a car.
Our team lost all its games.
I'll leave that up to you.
We arrived at the office on time.
That would be a waste of their talents.
Children begin school at the age of six.
He's swimming now.
Whales feed on plankton and small fish.
We adopted an alternative method.
The most amazing thing happened yesterday.
Let me do this for you.
I have not eaten any seafood since the recent oil spill.
Everyone likes you.
I'm by your side.
I wish I had the will power to stop eating junk food.
It's a risk we can't afford to take.
He has done it in just a few years.
This and no more.
If he had been honest, I would have employed him.
I trust her.
I'd like orange juice.
Weren't you here yesterday?
You ran a red light.
I hate spinach.
I've always wanted a daughter.
No one voted against it.
Where are your things?
He saved money for his old age.
She advised him not to use too much salt, but he wouldn't listen to her.
We might as well get this over with.
As far as I know, that never happened.
I found him a job.
Staying at home is boring.
All the students are present.
I don't have those answers.
I like what you did with your hair.
They were panting.
Bacteria are everywhere.
This train is made up of seven cars.
His sweater is gray.
He returned home for the first time in ten years.
Why did you listen to him?
What did Tom give you for Christmas?
This isn't the way to do it.
What can you give me?
It looks like she has a lot of friends.
Do you know what time that accident happened?
It's a hard, dirty job.
Because of rain, I could not go out.
You don't look that good.
Let's clean this up.
I'm not armed.
I want you to come back early.
I have borrowed a car.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
Good things come in small packages.
He let me work in this office.
His father approved of his plan.
How many times a week do you spend time doing fun stuff with your children?
He saved a lot of money.
We don't like violence.
I'll be sitting here while he's singing.
I finally caught up with my friends.
She advised him to see the dentist, but he said that he didn't have enough time to do so.
Tom has braces on his teeth.
I got it through my head that my parent's strict rules were for my own benefit.
You can stay as long as you like.
A person will have the face of an angel when borrowing something, but the face of the devil when returning it.
Calm down. I'll come over as soon as possible.
You don't have to read the whole thing from beginning to end.
Do you have anything to say?
Perhaps he'll never become famous.
He has been living in Ankara since 2006.
If it were not for plants, we wouldn't be able to live.
They're very busy.
I hope the bus will come before long.
She gave him mixed signals.
I know you're not serious.
I keep a good supply of stamps to save trips to the post office.
I already took the pies out of the oven.
I don't have your courage.
How long were you gone?
That'll be enough.
I don't know anything about what happened.
I'll marry you.
Are all passengers on board?
There was only one survivor of the accident.
I am fixing the washing machine.
Does Tom really deserve to be punished?
You can adjust the seat height by moving the adjustment lever up.
He wrote her a long letter, which he didn't mail.
You should probably go, Tom.
I never imagined I'd feel this way about you.
I felt like singing loudly when the exam was over.
I like listening to good music.
He received quite a few letters this morning.
Why do you permit it?
Were you shot at?
He always comes here at this time.
They handled it well.
It's been a good day.
Did you read them?
I've lost my strength.
You're the leader.
I promise you I'll come early.
You'd better listen to me.
I usually buy my clothes at the department store.
There were no clouds today.
I don't believe my eyes.
It's easy for her to make friends.
That is her car.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
He is in love with her.
I'll give you a lift.
I think you're jealous.
My parents hardly ever punished me for anything.
Everyone tried to sell their stocks.
She doesn't care how she dresses.
Cancer can be cured if discovered in time.
I don't want to get involved in that business.
How did you wind up doing this kind of work?
I really love my job.
I have some stuff to do at home.
It is too expensive.
He is at the office.
She was advised by him not to borrow money from his friends.
He put great emphasis on spoken English.
Could you show me that necktie?
How often do you brush your teeth?
That's not really necessary.
Good for you.
What did I miss?
Please stop talking. I need to concentrate on my game.
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
See you all tomorrow.
Tom doesn't like any kind of music.
I go to the museum whenever I get the chance.
My mother likes tulips very much and so does my sister.
It's the perfect size.
I was too surprised to speak.
I need to know.
We did what we were told.
I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
I don't know what more I can say.
He thought it was hilarious.
Have a good Christmas.
Are you kids hungry?
This dog eats almost anything.
I think Tom is old.
These implements are in common use.
Discretion is the better part of valor.
I will not let you do it.
You're not allowed to eat those.
He showed his photograph album to me.
He showed me how to make a cake.
She started dancing when she was eight.
I guess it's impossible for me to learn how to play the oboe.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
He could not walk any further.
Stop being so naive.
Tell me what has become of him.
Be nice.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Tom is a good man.
Aren't you hungry?
All of a sudden, a dog began barking.
Having finished all her housework, she sat down on the sofa to watch television.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
By the way, where does he live?
You're the master.
Stop what you're doing.
I'd like to have a test for breast cancer.
I don't need you or anybody else.
Come off it!
You are very rich.
You made me late.
She seemed uninterested.
Do you want to watch TV?
We will someday make the world a better place.
Can you help me wash these dishes?
I can't eat fruit in the morning.
I almost never remember dreams.
Let's say you're right.
Many flights were canceled because of the typhoon.
The lights are all off.
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind.
I can't remember the melody to that song.
Maybe I went a little too far.
Why should I have to leave?
He objected to our plan.
I have to cover his loss.
Have you told any of this to the police?
I heard yelling.
It's a slippery one.
It's a dog eat dog world out there.
I probably should have said something.
I refuse to answer the question.
Have a cookie.
I'm afraid of nothing.
How does Tom's suggestion strike you?
That is actually what I wanted.
You look like an imbecile.
I hope you're happy together.
I tricked you.
We have no choice.
Are you all completely crazy?
Who wants jello?
After I had done my homework, I went to bed.
Do you know where they come from?
Please breathe through your nose.
My house is your house.
It wasn't funny.
She went outside to get a breath of fresh air.
Don't make this personal.
I'll call her immediately.
There is a bookstore across from my house.
Do you understand what the problem is?
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping.
I want you to do this.
He borrowed the car from his friend.
It's very likely that he'll be chosen.
There was a curtain which was covering the door.
Tell the truth no matter what.
You have to do it today.
Are you ready to go out?
I am acting for my father.
How much is this tie?
I don't think I can eat this.
I don't feel like going out this morning.
The climate of Japan is milder than that of England.
I want a chair.
We have to crack down on illegal trading.
You can't go out.
Tom speaks five languages, including Russian.
My parents don't know.
Tom pushed back his chair and got up.
He intimated that all is not well in his marriage.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
We are good friends.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
I can't do this anymore.
I forgot my shopping list at home.
Put the desk against the wall.
The towel wasn't at all useful.
I'm finished with you.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
You're powerful.
These shoes are very comfortable.
Do you enjoy living like this?
You played tennis yesterday.
The twins smiled.
They all looked relieved.
How good are you?
We demand action.
There's nothing I can do to help Tom.
You cannot do this.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
He's not always happy.
Don't you ever touch me again.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
This shoe is a size bigger.
I have never read that book.
Tom isn't good at cooking.
Let me have your attention.
I'll have to tell her the truth tomorrow.
My hobby is reading comics.
I usually go shopping on Sunday afternoon.
No two snowflakes are exactly alike.
I'm not good-looking.
Do I look happy to you?
You should have worked harder.
Could you give me a discount?
I don't deserve it.
I'm playing a TV game.
They paid separately.
He thinks he's a genius.
There is nothing to worry about.
I run every day.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
Can you see that small house?
Are you getting tired?
I'm feeling sort of tired.
You can't go now.
I had a terrible dream last night.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I need a new broom. This one's shot.
I'd have waited for you.
They had a spat yesterday.
I have to come on Monday.
You're running a big risk in trusting him.
Why don't you leave him alone?
I was stung by a bee.
You are very beautiful.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
We're planning to do just that.
Ask me again in October.
I hate work.
You should get some exercise.
She has a small house.
Have you ever seen a film this good?
She's the perfect housewife.
I'm done listening to you.
I have to finish what I started.
I don't know why he's so mad.
I went to school.
He is my type!
How much is the rent per month?
Are you looking for somebody?
I think you like me.
We didn't get paid this week.
I apologized profusely.
You must be blind as a bat if you couldn't see it.
I gave you what you wanted.
I suppose you've got a point.
I'll prove it to you.
I want to pretend it never happened.
I don't care if it's a bit cold.
I have a problem.
Would you mind if I swam in your pool?
What's the reason?
Time will tell.
Is there a pen on the desk?
The water's warm.
The meeting's about to start.
She looks very happy.
She advised him to go there alone.
I'm always happy.
I'm going to hang up now.
She kept her eyes closed.
She got engaged to him.
Why are you ignoring me?
She's accustomed to getting up early.
There's not much difference.
Do you want some help?
What else can go wrong?
You can go out on condition that you come home by seven.
This dog is yours.
He has a vivid imagination.
Put the baby to sleep.
I didn't feel well.
Which team will win?
You may meet him.
In a sense, it is true.
That's a fake.
I would rather stay here.
They look cool.
You're very nice.
I love you just as you are.
It was just a stupid mistake.
I caught it.
He shook his son by the shoulder.
I'll help you as much as I can.
Could we take you somewhere else?
Why don't you all just shut up?
Eat meals slowly.
You were fantastic.
I just want you out of my house.
I think about him often.
I take care of my grandfather.
Opportunity waits for no one.
We're too close.
I don't have the authority to order that.
The brave fireman rescued a boy from the burning house.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
What do you think of the new teacher?
You're always nagging me.
I apologize for the delay.
You're the master.
The leaves fell.
Something's not right.
Tom has a thick beard.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
I did it without any problems.
I went there by bus and train.
How will I recognize you?
I ordered the children to stay quiet, but they kept on making noise.
A thief believes everybody steals.
I've been hoping to meet you.
What do you know about all this?
We're not sure.
We closed the restaurant three hours early yesterday.
Dinner smells delicious.
That he loved her was certain.
He wants to go.
After we walked for a while, we arrived at the lake.
The exception proves the rule.
She has a passion for cake.
There were three empty wine bottles on the table.
She returned the book to the library.
What are you working on?
I remember what I saw.
When you leave the room, please make sure you turn off the lights.
She was stupid enough to believe him.
I wish you success in your work.
I intended to study medicine in America.
I couldn't prevent Tom from eating all the cookies.
Have a good time.
I'm getting back together with my ex-girlfriend.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
Don't let anyone enter the room.
What a smart idea!
There is no use waiting for her any longer.
I need someone now.
Girls say that all the time.
I will get in touch with you.
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
Do you have a crush on my brother?
I've been calling all day.
She knows many proverbs.
I hope to have my car paid off by next September.
Let me deal with him.
Are you looking for a job?
I need to borrow your pen.
I'm tired of being careful.
There is a cottage beyond the bridge.
I told you I don't know how to do that.
This is your hat, isn't it?
I refused for personal reasons.
What's your favorite movie?
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
They have already finished the work.
I was able to accomplish a lot today.
How are we feeling today?
School begins the day after tomorrow.
That's a myth.
Tom only sleeps about five hours a night.
She could not cope with anxiety.
I wonder if my efforts will pay off.
Everything is broken.
We're not going home.
She should have bought a used car.
I couldn't tell you why.
We're as good as dead now.
He would accept no compromise.
There was a cottage on the side of the hill.
I brought you red roses.
You don't need a list.
What's your theory on what happened?
Do you play in a band?
Do you feel up to it?
We all know.
His warm way with people had made him hugely popular.
My picture's in every police station in the country.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I saw Tom in the hallway.
Hang your coat on the hook.
I've never been better.
Glass breaks easily.
I grew up in a small town.
I don't want you to do that.
I hear you were grounded.
How did I look?
You don't want much, do you?
I do want to see you.
I wanted to marry him.
Tom poured more wine into his glass.
I caught a beautiful butterfly.
They would like to stay at home.
I truly hope not.
The show's about a New Jersey mob boss who's in psychotherapy.
A strange feeling came over me.
Be more precise.
I think I'll come back soon.
Tom saw Mary crying.
The foreign minister attended the talks.
Do you take plastic?
Yakitori is a Japanese food.
I will act on your advice.
Tom has pleaded not guilty.
I thought you were having a good time.
I was so drunk last night.
The government will provide interest-free loans to firms that participate in the program.
I really do need your help.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
She explained to him how to solve the puzzle.
Come in, the door's open.
What do you call that contraption?
I heard that one way to stay healthy is to avoid eating any food with unpronounceable ingredients.
You have a lot of books.
Tom has sold his house in Boston.
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
I couldn't understand his joke.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
Money is not a criterion of success.
Are you looking for something?
This is not funny anymore.
I want to know everything about it.
I think you should leave now.
The lawn needs to be watered.
Why isn't there any wine left in the bottle? Did you kids drink it?
I have a date.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
To make matters worse, it began to rain.
He can hardly walk.
Who is she speaking to?
Did Tom ever tell you how he first met Mary?
Where did the accident take place?
I ordered Chinese food.
This camera is Tom's.
This is the life that I chose.
It's not about money.
Can you eat raw oysters?
I was just leaving.
I looked in the window.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
The man never told the police what his destination was.
Don't use slang if you can help it.
What do you have to lose?
Show me what you bought.
This can't be what it looks like.
It was not my intention.
Wait right here.
What are you eating?
That's what I've always said.
Classes start at eight in the morning.
Are you ready to begin?
I'd like to have a cat.
I don't often get invited to parties.
Don't tell Tom you're a cop.
I have hardly any English books.
That was naive of me.
Some months have thirty days, others thirty one.
May I offer you my chair?
I'm looking forward to that.
I suppose that's possible.
This is nothing more than wishful thinking.
Did you steal that car?
You're surrounded.
If you need anything, let me know.
Tom and Mary went to a fancy restaurant to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
How do you remember that?
He turned to his friend for help.
What is your name?
We don't want anyone getting hurt.
I have immunity.
It's a hassle trying to decide what to wear to the party.
I'm wondering if I love him.
People who break the law are punished.
Experts have failed to come up with an explanation of why the explosion happened.
She cut the apple with a knife.
Should I be worried?
I don't like to be alone.
I bought him a clock.
I sold my books cheaply.
There's another reason.
You're winning, aren't you?
He likes sweet tea.
I have a few tickets in row 15.
You came too late.
You're very open.
Can you lower the price?
All of us want to live as long as possible.
I love your son.
She came to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese.
I've got you.
We lost.
You're the only person who shows me any respect.
I'm not normal.
She laid the magazine on the table.
I'm sure we can trust Tom.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
I don't want you to see me naked.
If you've been drinking, perhaps your spouse can drive you home.
I must refuse.
Stay absolutely still.
I'm glad you decided to come.
I coughed up blood.
He pretended to be a doctor.
I have to say I envy you.
I want to go to Tokyo.
Why do you think you're here?
You can't just not pay someone for work you hired them to do.
You can see that the architect paid scrupulous attention to detail.
I like singing with Tom.
Tom is an imposter.
You should protect your eyes from direct sunlight.
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?
Yokohama is a beautiful port town.
I'm ruined.
This is a beautiful house.
I recognized her at first sight.
Let's not kid ourselves.
Do you have to work tonight?
They shouted for help.
If I were you, I'd study harder.
Do you spend much time writing email?
I hope you're well rested.
Just do your job.
We can't be the only two people who forgot to pay our bills on time.
Daddy, I can't walk any more. Could you give me a piggyback ride?
Tom almost always wears sunglasses.
Let's face reality.
He cannot be saved.
They can't hurt you now.
He couldn't adapt to new circumstances.
I don't expect anything from you.
Every family has a skeleton in the closet.
I intended to have been a teacher.
He who lives by the sword will die by the sword.
May I have this book?
Where did she buy books?
Say you understand me.
You're not the only woman here.
He's really quick.
Tom kissed his cousin.
Tom must be aware of the danger.
I'm really not supposed to do this.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
Do you wash your hands before meals?
He wants something cold to drink.
Mr. Jackson is our science teacher.
I wish my girlfriend would spend more time with me.
When I grow up I want to be just like you.
I did something really stupid.
I'm not your enemy.
Aim. Fire!
These aren't words.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
He lived abroad for many years.
We'll call you.
How long will you stay in Japan?
At least thirty students were absent.
I have six mouths to feed.
It was nice of you to come all this way to see me.
His oldest son is not married.
I want to know what's going on.
Take it all.
We are going to climb that mountain.
My heart skipped a beat when my wife told me she was pregnant.
We gather here once a week.
It could cost you your head.
I'm incredibly tired.
I accused him of cheating.
She loves cooking.
I am willing to help you.
What exactly are you implying?
Seen from a distance, this mountain looks like Mt. Fuji.
I can show you the pictures.
He finished reading the book.
What's it called?
I cannot stand this noise.
I did not read a book yesterday.
I can't take it any longer.
I felt sure this would happen.
The country's main products are cocoa and gold.
You're not fast enough.
I gave her her dictionary back.
Are you two going out together?
Graham Greene is a favorite author of mine.
I saw you outside.
Are you in a bad mood?
Japan imports great quantities of crude oil.
We'll go to church this evening.
I'm worried about it.
Did you kill anybody?
What are you cooking today?
Repeat after me.
It's way past your bedtime.
Please come and see me again.
At home, we speak only French.
Our parents should be taken care of.
I will do anything for him.
It was night.
I'll make you happy.
How did you come up with that answer?
Tickets are available to the public for $30.
How are you feeling?
You're productive.
We voted for the candidate.
I guess my mind just wandered.
I like the colors.
Get them out of my sight.
I still don't know.
That makes everything simpler.
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today.
He doesn't watch television at all.
I made plans.
When will you come back home?
They can't do anything else.
Ask her what her name is.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
Individual freedom is the foundation of democracy.
I decided to subscribe to the magazine.
Is that what you think I want to hear?
Everyone should be able to express their opinion.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
He succeeded to his uncle's fortune.
I'm not going to name names.
I think you're going to find this interesting.
I cannot find time to read the book.
That hasn't happened yet.
I want you to look out the window.
I need it as quickly as possible.
I want you to speak frankly.
Don't worry.
The dog is ours.
She can skate.
Tom bought a gift for his daughter.
They'll know what to do.
Do you want a car?
You'll get half the money now, and the other half on completion of the job.
Keep quiet.
I had him wash the car.
His birthday just happens to be the same as mine.
He makes a point of doing ten push-ups before going to bed.
I'd say you're jealous.
Do you have a twin brother?
I want you to dance with me.
As soon as the child saw his mother, he stopped crying.
My father always sleeps while watching the TV.
You could count to ten when you were two.
The volcano erupts at regular intervals.
We could understand each other.
China is about twenty-five times as large as Japan.
The light went out.
I didn't know where else to go.
I've been gone for a long time.
I'd like to hear that.
What was in it for you?
How much money do you have on you right now?
You're one savvy negotiator.
This tea smells nice.
Tom tried to resuscitate Mary.
I was busy.
Is everybody hungry?
I slept aboard the ship.
Oranges are sweeter than lemons.
Have you seen my son?
You can do it.
This bridge is built of stone.
You're my only real friend.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I didn't promise anybody anything.
Let's not gloat.
I hope you're not going to disappoint me.
Since I stayed up late, I'm very sleepy.
What is the purpose of the stock market?
The hikers were all but frozen when they were found.
Our team lost.
Tom isn't a very good cook.
I built this doghouse by myself.
That dog runs very fast.
That child was left in the sun too long.
I have a bad pain in my lower back.
You have to stay fit.
Are you talking to yourself again?
Get some help, will you?
Tom shrugged.
That's where you're mistaken.
It's six o'clock already.
It's a quarter past nine.
Why didn't Tom move?
Did you see anyone run away?
I have to go back to work now.
Take a breath.
You're three hours late.
Rabbits have long ears.
I can't wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this.
All of us stared at her.
Stop talking about Tom.
Didn't it ever occur to them that they would be punished?
It's natural for family members to help each other.
I'd like Tom to spend some time with our children.
That's kind of you to say.
It was impolite of him to do so.
The train is bound for London.
Germany has no minimum wage.
Are you going to eat those fries?
Your being here means a lot to me.
I can't make ends meet now.
Can you slow down a little?
You should think before you begin to speak.
I think it's time for me to leave for school.
I work out.
It's night.
I have nothing to do with the crime.
She returned the book to the library.
That could be difficult.
Take your shot.
I need to be prepared.
He's about to finish reading the book.
Mary thinks that the world is a dangerous place.
Are you sure about that?
I am sure that you will be satisfied.
I rescued you.
I see what you mean.
I learned that when I was a kid.
Where did you see those women?
I hope you have insurance.
It took her a long time to choose a hat.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
I want you to take this medicine.
Do you like French wine?
Let's not watch TV.
Tom is working on your car.
I abhor spiders.
What do you think they'll do to me?
I don't care for the way he talks.
Stay and have a drink with us.
What do you suppose is in this box?
It irritates Mary when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
We both want it.
It's not sure it will happen.
Ask her for advice.
Did I wake you up?
Did you do this?
Do you know why she's so angry?
What don't you like?
You're driving like a maniac!
My dress was ruined when it came back from the cleaner's.
Why am I doing this?
No one will give me any money.
He likes soccer a lot.
What right do you have to order us around?
He dropped a vase.
I don't know why.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Actually, I did write it.
Mary was given a raise by her employer.
It was not always this way.
You're very generous.
I'm not sure what I was thinking.
I'm growing tired of all this arguing.
Shall I begin?
The responsibility is mine.
She speaks English with a foreign accent.
I hate the sound that cellophane makes when you crinkle it.
Who are you?
Have you read the book Tom bought for you?
Bring all your money.
Shall I come to your office?
We welcome you to our club.
We have to find out why they want us to do this.
You're a terrible person.
Do you have psychic powers?
Tom is scared of ghosts.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will take Mary to the party.
Summer is coming.
You're big.
That is no business of yours.
He slept soundly.
He had to carry the bag.
You need to hurry.
Can I write it like that?
I like this one even better.
I do not have any more time.
Is it a direct flight?
How long did that take?
It is Pochi's food.
You deserve more than that.
I'll have the same.
Organic food is usually more expensive.
How is it that you know so much about Japanese history?
She participates in many school activities.
I really wish I could be there with you.
I feel like such an idiot.
Tom and Mary adopted a handicapped child.
They went on a trip abroad for the first time.
Would you like to get something to eat? It's on me.
Don't drag me into this.
You're creative.
The strange object in the sky could be seen with the unaided eye.
Is anybody listening?
We're here, too.
He retired at 65.
Nothing is going to happen.
Stop yelling!
He said something to my friend.
I'm weak.
I'm a little child.
Being very tired, I soon fell asleep.
We have known each other since childhood.
I guess my mind just wandered.
Do you know all these people?
I play trumpet in a symphonic wind orchestra.
This is different.
I do remember.
Tom refused to tell us anything.
He can speak eight languages.
What I did was wrong.
We all change.
I don't have the ball.
I don't belong to any club.
Did I embarrass you?
Go ahead.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.
I don't know what you're so worried about.
He differs from me in some ways.
You're the most incredible person I've ever met.
How could it have happened?
I don't think it's good for him to go alone.
Scream as loud as you can.
We're not welcome.

That's what I was hoping to hear.
Grab your gear.
The front door remained locked.
I think skateboards are usually cheaper than rollerblades.

I can't get that melody out of my head.
She has a small black dog.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
I had never heard anyone speak of him before.
The bar is closed.
They knew how much danger they were in.
The Beatles gave five concerts in Tokyo in 1996.
We all agreed unanimously.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
I'll sue you.
I know what Tom likes to eat.
I'm just making a suggestion.
My house is near the school.
If he really doesn't want to go, he shouldn't have to.
When are we going to do it?
I want you to have this.
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen.
I am bored out of my mind.

How heavy is your suitcase?
Can you remember his name?
I know some of Tom's friends.
He drove to school.
I'm ready if you are.
It didn't happen that way.
Where are we going to go?

I've just been punished.
Please eat some cake.
That's what I figured.
I like dark red better.
The children are playing outside.
Don't underestimate your own strength.
I would like to tell you something.
I felt isolated.

Do you live here?
You may choose whichever book you like.
Do you have to work tonight?
He is anxious to go to America.
Can you speak another language?
I want you to promise me something.
I'd lock my doors if I were you.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
How about running?
I just have one quibble with this product.
It's all over between us.
He'll get over it.
Does anyone want to do anything?
I bought a pen like yours yesterday.
She traveled all over the world.
I don't like the way you laugh at her.
I can't believe he kissed you.

I thought you might want to know.
The dog nipped at me.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.

You're totally ignorant.
He's wide awake.
There's not enough coffee for everyone.
I want you to get in your car.
They're just for you.
He likes me.
I often travel.
It was not an accident.
They made me do it.
The best thing would be for you to do the work yourself.
Have you ever been arrested?
Don't interfere in others' affairs.
I shouldn't have done this.
My uncle drives a Ford.
The situation is a lot worse than we imagined.
The job is almost finished.
I wish I didn't have to work.
Could you explain it more simply?

What's taking you so long?
I'm going to put them in a room and let them battle it out.
The exercises did her good.
Heavy snow delayed the train for several hours.
I figured it out by myself.
I don't see much of him.
He is a good swimmer.
I don't know the reason for her absence.
Tom's funny.
Tom said he wanted to talk.
You should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive.
They're not so bad.
We live in a remote area.
I promised to help my brother with his homework.
The job isn't anywhere near done.
I try to help Tom every chance I get.

I want a full report before 2:30.
I couldn't make myself understood in English.
We shall try to answer the following questions.
Leave that to me.
It's too late.

You might get something in the mail today.
I'll go see.
Do you want to go to the station with me?
He refused our offer to arrange a press conference.
I'll call you back later.
She handed me the letter without saying anything.

What are you going to do with it?
Chocolate is toxic to many animals.
I approve of your plan.
I was deeply impressed by his speech.
The negotiations are at a very delicate stage.
Step out of the car and place your hands behind your back.

Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
Don't underestimate his determination.
Leave your desk as it is.
He didn't dare say anything.
They could've killed you.
I wonder what Tom actually thinks.
Who wants some hot chocolate?
I will never, ever drink again.
Anybody could do this.
Tom is very unhappy.
The cottage was clean and tidy.
What's that?
Tom and Mary have been drinking.
He's in pain.
I don't like that one.

Give me the car keys.
Is that a riddle?
He's now short of money.
I wanted to surprise Tom.
He taught me how to drive.
If I were a rich man, I wouldn't have to work hard.
What would you like to eat?
I can't believe you actually did that.
The scandal ruined his career.
You don't have to apologize.
Tom's very annoying.
This isn't a safe place.
You can expect to receive a little something from us soon.
Clearly you are mistaken.
My parents have gone to the airport to see my uncle off.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
I can do it by myself!
"Are you tired?" "No, not at all."
Sorry, something went wrong.

I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
Is it safe to swim in this river?
I still have a lot of time for fun.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
I didn't suspect anything.
I got to Boston yesterday afternoon.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate that.
I know you like chocolate.
She decided not to go.
You are twice as strong as I am.
No matter how often I tell her, she keeps making the same mistake.
Don't make me kill you.
I just want to be loved.
My friends don't know where I am.
Animals are afraid of fire.

I phoned.
You're not supposed to be in here.

It was a busy night.
Let me hear it.
Give him time.

They really slept on the floor.
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess.
Give me back the TV remote.
Are you lost?
What is it you want to talk about?
What kind of beer do you have?
Can I tell you something very personal?
I'm not going to argue with you.
Just then, the telephone rang.
Tom may have been in Boston with Mary last week.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Tom receives a high salary.
I want you to be my friend.

You don't have the right.
We have known each other for years.
They are jealous of our success.
This book is very popular among women.
It's not broken.
I didn't give them anything.
When I phone them nobody answers.
How is your dad?
There's a long line at every cash register.
In order to see that picture better, I want to get a little closer.
What is this for?
Stay away from my motorcycle.
I could not keep the tears from my eyes.
She doesn't understand me, either.
There's something fishy going on.
They were playing tennis.
I used to love that.
Where's the pharmacy?
You're driving too fast.
If the phone rings again, I plan to ignore it.
You're always complaining.

I can look at it when you're ready.
They are Christians.
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench.
Their marriage broke up last year.
Is that really a road we want to go down?
I have to talk to Tom about what happened.
Are you afraid of it?
I'm busy, so I can't go.
Life is like a journey.
You are welcome here.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
Was it all a dream?
I feel faint.
Compared to our house, yours is a palace.
Tom refused to settle down.
Do you think Tom hates me?
You're very direct.

How can you concentrate?
The plane flew over the mountain.
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.
Tom was looking for place to eat that had reasonable prices.

Please tell me how you plan to do that.

I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't.
Are you picking on me?
Do you find me unattractive?

I'd like to have my blood examined.
It'll cost at least five dollars.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
Don't be so impatient.

I could try.

Tom spent three weeks in Boston.
You are the one.
She left me a note.
It's not as bad as it seems.
Is it really possible?

Can you do it faster?
Thank you for your kindness.
I'll get rid of them.
We're broke.
There were hundreds of cars on the street.
She was having a hard time swimming.

The change was immediate.
He passed his property on to his son.
All you do is complain!
You can call me anytime you like.

Have you done all your homework?
How did I get here?
I was careful to not leave any evidence.
You're lucky you didn't die.
My mother is preparing supper.
I wonder if you'd help us.
No one answered.
When are you going to get married?
Tom has a meeting this morning.
They're all thieves.
Are you ready to go?
Am I interrupting anything?
Now leave us.
The whole country was covered with snow.
You're a prisoner.
The more stubborn you are, the more isolated you become.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
It's crowded again today.
Tom's free.
This will help keep you warm.
I knew I could do it.
I want you to go upstairs.
We wandered aimlessly around the shopping district.
I made that decision on my own.
You're just like your mother.
You're going to lose.
What's the teacher explaining?
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.
She practices the piano every day.
Tom came here to ask us to help him.
Why did Tom do that?
The game's almost over.
Close the door after you.
Stop lying.
She's always grumbling.
Don't you want to go out?
She is listening to him.
I left the money with him.
That's what I said all along.
About how many hours does it take by car?
Furthermore, I still don't think this a huge cultural difference.
They were not impressed.
I didn't even know you spoke French.
What is this called?
They can't fire you.
Stay where you are. I'm on my way.
When can you start?
I'm very much obliged to you for your kindness.
It's none of your business.
I quite agree with you.
I listened but couldn't make out what they were saying.
I promise you I'll help you.
You look really good.
A customs declaration is required.
Since he didn't know what to say, he remained silent.
You can't buy this medicine without a prescription.
I'm proud of you.

I'm going to call it a night.
He sometimes is absent from work without good cause.
Did the car look old?

How did you get a naked picture of me?
You're very attractive.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
I'll follow you.
You must do this alone.
He is not fond of sports, and I am not either.
I was outraged by his answer.
It was broken.
Come whenever you want to.
Help me out here.
If it were not for exams, we would be happy.
Get the door, will you?
Why did you quit?
Where can I find toothpaste?
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Why don't you give me a break?
The teacher let him go home.
Which of you will come with me?
I put some milk in my coffee.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Excuse me, can I have a word with you?
They did not keep their word.
I don't really feel like reading.
Who do you think would do such a thing?
You should apologize to her for being so distant.
I just remembered something I have to do before tomorrow morning.
I'm going to get myself some coffee. Do you want some?
You are twice as strong as me.
It's better for you not to see my grandpa.
I must object.
I ran as fast as I could.
No one knows their name.
Tom isn't qualified to teach high school.
There is a strike.
You looked exhausted.
I like that job.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
They said you were fired.
He took my umbrella without so much as asking.
He attained his goal.
They are my friends.
I'm the boss around here.
That's not what I've heard.
She is a selfish person.
I'm chicken.
Get ready for bed.
We debated the problem.
Come and see me once in a while.
I can't believe you fell for that.
I'm thinking of going to Germany to study medicine.
You need to go to bed again.
Tom went back to the hotel.
This dog bites.
He is generous with his money.
I thought you'd eventually realize Tom didn't like you.
I'm uninsured.
What's the fax number for this hotel?
I don't know why you don't like Tom.
It's just a rumor.
I'm going to hurt you.
I'm no one special.
The sisters are quite alike.
We'll read this book until the end of the year.
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.
It won't make any difference.
I just want to hang out with you.
There's no need to hurry.
Wake up.
He can't sing.
Who was that you were just talking to?
I'm taking a couple of days off.

As a rule of thumb, you should plan on one pound of beef for every two guests.
Have you ever been in love?
Tom seemed very impressed.
I talked about music.
He made the most of his opportunity.
I do think I understand.
I've already spent all my pocket money for this month.
Don't tell me you're not scared.
I love sitting on the beach.
Even at the end of the nineteenth century, sailors in the British Navy were not permitted to use knives and forks because using them was considered a sign of weakness.

We did that yesterday.
He's started writing a novel.
I don't see your name on it.
The sentence is free from grammatical mistakes.
We're not friends anymore.
We never learned what happened or why.
A computer can calculate very rapidly.
She sat next to me.
I feel sorry for her.
Atoms are in everything.
This is gold.
They know what happened.
I left my hat on the plane.
He is capable of running a mile in four minutes.
Quit behaving like a kid.
Would you care for drinks?
Do you still want me to give Tom your old computer?
I'm taking a couple of days off.
How did you get into the house?
Father is out, but Mother is at home.
I thought you might be upset.
I had to get out of there.
She took advantage of her paid vacation and went skiing.
We're not used to it.
Let me leave!
Let's do this properly.
I would like you to introduce me to her.
He joined the opposing team.
I don't want to go bald when I'm still young.
We need to find what's inside these boxes.

I wish I were clever.
I'd bet my life on it.
They live in this town.
I always have a lot of fun when I come here.
What do you remember?
It was terrifying.

What was he doing there?
Don't jump to any conclusions.
Whose son are you?
She got home at seven.
Do you know why he wasn't at school?
You can't park your car here.
He seems very sleepy.
It's unbelievable.
Let's wait a while.
They teased the new student.
I smell something burning.
The couple spent a lot of money on furnishing their house.
I've done everything you've asked.
Are you all finished here?
I don't want any more problems.
I'm studying French and web design.
Excess of politeness is annoying.
Do you want to try it?
I'm sure about his name.
I just want to be a good neighbor.
The last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat vegetables.
I lost my health insurance.
It was not until yesterday that I learned the truth.
She divorced her husband.
Let's sit down.
Tom hasn't forgiven anybody.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
Can you give me your cell number?
We need to remember to mail this letter tomorrow.
I'm not in a party mood.
It's hard to know what to do.
I was wondering when you were going to tell me that.
Where did I put that box?
I don't know how else to say it.
Have you been drinking?
The floor was covered with blood.
I was surprised by the news this morning.
I know what to ignore.
I really enjoyed myself.
Count the apples in the basket.
I won't sign this.
Tom knows how to have a good time.
Say goodbye to your friends.
My father is always getting angry.
Do your parents speak French?
That's not an answer.
Contact my assistant if you have any questions.
Don't worry.
I put on my trousers.
What am I supposed to do if Tom comes?
You're totally right.
I kept the seat warm for you.
Hurry up, or you will miss the train.
Why would I want to do that?
There's hardly any water in the bucket.
I hate that you have to leave.
Which is it going to be?
Just as I was getting the hang of things, they changed the system.
I thought Tom had agreed to do the job.
Close that door.
She hired him.
She will leave the hospital soon.
Where did you buy this book?
I didn't catch what you said.
It was one of those things.
You may not like this book.
You know where I'm going.
I was like you once.
Excuse me, but where is the library?
It's all over now.
I can't exclude it.

We were supposed to help Tom yesterday afternoon.
I want to know why you're doing this.
It is very cold here all the year round.
Life is a dream.
Tom made himself a cup of tea.
There was a traffic accident in front of the house yesterday.
He doesn't go to the office on Saturday.
He denied having said such a thing.
I bought a few eggs and a little milk.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
I am doubtful whether he will come.
You're probably tired.
What's your home address?
Help us, please.
How can you stand it?
Let Tom sleep.
We must observe the rules.
Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
I wish I could stay longer.
Tom had a difficult job.
A note was attached to the document with a paper clip.
You'll ask Tom, won't you?
You tried.
The skirt is green.
She runs a dance studio.
You shouldn't have said that kind of thing to him.

He's too slow.
I have often been here.
I know they're still alive.

Am I cleared for duty?
Do you know why this date is important?
Let's not forget we never could have done this without Tom's help.
We talked.
Her coat is fur on the inside.
This music is terrible.
I know only this.
I punched him in the chin.
I really mean it.
What's the matter with you?
I know your father.
Show me how to do this.

He behaves respectfully toward his superiors.
Disease and famine go together.

Nobody can hear you.
If you want, you can phone me.

Stop calling me Tom.
She was injured in the traffic accident.
Where's the shopping center?
He is going to stay at a friend's house.
It's Tom's turn to wash the dishes.
How old were you when your father was killed?
I'd like to thank you for coming today.

Tom was trying not to smile.
I just want to get my work done.
You have no messages.
Tom looks really relieved.
It's my CD.
Where are you going to go?

I'd appreciate that.
I don't know what's got into her.
I need a hacksaw to finish this job.
Tom knew that Mary was busy.
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes.
That sounds a lot easier to do than it is.

How many did you get?
There is little hope that they are alive.
Go away before they see you here.
I'm no different.
I regretted having wasted a great deal of time.
I need to travel.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
You should learn from your mistakes.
Did I understand that correctly?
Draw a picture of yourself.
Tom drives too fast.
Tom did a pretty good job.
There are few houses around here.
I revealed the truth of the matter.
I regret losing that opportunity.
I was with Tom from 8:30 to 2:30.

He crashed his car because someone tampered with the brakes.
I want you to find out.
We have bigger problems to worry about.

Are we finished?
That man is unworthy of you.
They made fun of my clothes.
Don't say a word to me.
Is there something in particular that you want to watch?
We told everyone.
Tom handed Mary some money.
Tell them what you told me.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
You don't know how lucky you are.
Your paintings are beautiful.
Ask Tom to explain it.
I want to apologize to all of you for what just happened.
How long have you been a doctor here?
We work in a factory.

The garden was full of yellow flowers.
Prices have reached a 13-year high.
It is cold there, even in summer.
Go put some clean clothes on.

He chose his words carefully.
Every day my dad leaves for work at eight o'clock.

We go to the movies together once in a while.
I disobeyed you.
We're all hungry.
What kind of flowers do you like?
I didn't know you then.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
As far as I'm concerned, things are going well.
You cannot be serious.
According to my calculation, she should be in India by now.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I need some sugar to make a cake.
They're downstairs.
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you.
That's my fault.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Please make yourself at home here.
Why not let Tom try?
She didn't telephone after all.
Let me help you with the dishes.
I can't be something I'm not.
The girl who is dressed in white is my fiancée.
France was at war with Russia.
What year were you born?
We're working to fix this bug.
Newton saw an apple fall off a tree.
I'm sore all over.
As far as I know, he has never come on time.
I know what you're thinking.
It would be better if you didn't eat before going to bed.
I can smell the ocean.
Was he, in fact, guilty of wrongdoing?
I did have fun.
I'm out of place here.
Could somebody get me a spoon?
They want to tell you their story.
Is that all you can say?
Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
The telephone was just ringing, wasn't it?
I hope you're happy.
Get into your car.
She claims that she knows nothing about him.
Is there anything you need?
We stopped for lunch at a local restaurant.
I would like to visit New York someday.
They kept it secret that they were in love.
I just don't understand.
I know you like chocolate.
Dial 110 at once.
He liked that.
He was exiled to an island for the crime of high treason.
Who else is with you?
I never drink alone.
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
I haven't eaten French food since I left France.
I'll go first.

She was indignant when I said she was lying.
I knew it was right.
She smiled.
I opened the drawer to get a pencil.
This telephone is connected to the fax machine.
She got engaged to him.
Believe what you want.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
I changed my address last month.
We went to a movie.
He beckoned me to follow him.
I don't need anyone anymore.
I had a really good time yesterday.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
I just want to know who's in the room.
That's not an option.
You're wasting my time.
We can pay.
You can't quit now.
It could rain tonight.
I can hear a saxophone somewhere.
You deserve more than that.
We keep our most interesting thoughts and the most interesting side of ourselves hidden away.
Keep off the grass.
He threw everything out of the boat.
I would rather not go.
We should've brought another bottle of wine.
I am yours and you are mine.
The thief cut the telephone lines before breaking into the house.
You are both in the wrong.
Can we save the planet?
The police caught the thief.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
Tom had a panic attack.
You don't really want that, do you?
Tell me which one to choose.
Don't try to get up yet.
What's going on here?
I went to the station.
I was surprised because my husband actually ate some of our wedding cake.
He can't stop thinking like that.
You're greedy.
Those are old wives' tales.
I'm glad you decided to come.
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
Let me help you with that.
He's helping me.
He affirmed that he saw the crash.
Are you sure you're up for it?
You should write a novel.
We drink our tea with sugar.
The gunman was found to be insane.
You're the best.
Not everyone is honest.
That's all I can offer you.
Did you have fun last night?
That's what we have to figure out.
I have read three Shakespearian works up to now.
Don't buy that.
He constantly criticizes other people.
I didn't think you'd show up.
I think you might need my help.
I cover twenty miles a day.
This is as heavy as lead.
I just want to be alone.
How many of them are there?
You are not entitled to attend the meeting.
He was lying on the bed.
It's free.
Tom isn't as good at French as he thinks he is.
I can't believe how much things have changed since we were kids.
Didn't you hear me?
He signed the check.
We want to talk to you about that.
I never worry.
I thought Tom would be hungry.
If you want that, you can have it.
You're talkative.
His sister can't talk to you today.
I'll help you prevent that from happening again.
We can't be sure of the total cost yet.
I felt betrayed.
We invite you to listen to us again.
Portugal is not an exception.
Give me my drink.
I figured you could use some help.
Tom has a lot of money.
Tom made room for Mary on the bench.
Tom accidentally shot himself in the foot while cleaning his gun.
I think we should celebrate.
I hope things will get better.
You are hopeless.
Where's your drink?
He did not speak at all.
It is very kind of you to send me such a nice present.
I dislike eggs.
You have reached your destination.
Tom is at work.
I've got to learn to slow down.
I don't know where I'm going.
All the children laughed at Tom.
You're no friend of mine.
I cut my right hand on a piece of glass.
She didn't like her husband.
I'm more than a friend.
She wanted him to say that he would pay the bill.
I'm thirty years older than you.
You're confused again, aren't you?
Our native language is Japanese.
I can't let you do that.
I'll try to contact Tom.
Any chance of us getting approved?
I've got something for you.
I fell.
Her mother always accompanies her.
You will find that book in the historical section of the library.
It's an idea whose time has come.
I'll meet you there.
You have a way with women.
I used to like folk music.
I don't often get invited to parties.
Come off it.
She still hated him, even after he died.
He was lying on the grass.
Is this the first time you've eaten Japanese food?
Tom seems to be sympathetic.
We were both hungry.
Say please.
The arrow glanced off the tree.
That accident happened near his house.
Are you a high school student?
They did not clap for us.
I don't know what you want to hear.
Can you tell me why you want to work for us?
He ignored her advice.
I said it was all right.
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
We're partners.
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
I want to join your group.
The boy came running.
I have three dogs. One is male and the other two are female.
This is worrisome.
What time did you close the store last night?
I just want a little more of that.
We complained that the room was cold.
It seems warm outside.
Look out for pickpockets.
I don't care who your father is. You still have to follow my orders.
Tom and Mary are worried.
I just want this to be over.
This bike is easy to ride.
Don't sit on that bench.
I think Tom needs to go.
There is a solution though.
